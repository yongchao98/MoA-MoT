    "Here are the steps following the Test-Driven Development approach to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **List of Tests:**\n    *   **Test 1 (Problem Scenario):** Given that the pp-III branch (source of Boron-8 neutrinos) has stopped, the primary sources of flux are the CNO cycle (continuous spectrum) and the pp-II branch (strong Beryllium-7 line at 861 keV). Band 1 (700-800 keV) will only see the CNO flux. Band 2 (800-900 keV) will see both CNO flux and the dominant Be-7 line flux. The ratio should be a small number, approximately 0.01.\n    *   **Test 2 (CNO Only):** In a hypothetical case where only CNO reactions occur, the continuous and relatively smooth spectrum should result in nearly equal fluxes in two adjacent energy bands of the same width. The ratio should be approximately 1.\n    *   **Test 3 (pp-II Only):** In a hypothetical case where only the pp-II branch is active, the only relevant flux is the Be-7 line at 861 keV, which falls entirely within Band 2. The flux in Band 1 would be zero. The ratio should be 0.\n\n2.  **Python Implementation and Testing:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_neutrino_flux_ratio(active_reactions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands\n    based on which solar reactions are active.\n\n    Band 1: 700-800 keV\n    Band 2: 800-900 keV\n\n    Args:\n        active_reactions (dict): A dictionary with keys 'pp-II', 'pp-III', 'CNO'\n                                 and boolean values indicating if they are active.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The ratio of Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Data based on the Standard Solar Model ---\n    # Total flux of the Be-7 line at 861 keV (from pp-II branch) in cm^-2 s^-1.\n    FLUX_BE7_LINE = 5.0e9\n    # Total flux of CNO neutrinos (13N and 15O) in cm^-2 s^-1.\n    FLUX_CNO_TOTAL = 5.2e8\n    # Total flux of B-8 neutrinos (from pp-III branch) in cm^-2 s^-1.\n    FLUX_B8_TOTAL = 5.0e6\n\n    # --- Approximations for flux in a 100 keV band ---\n    # CNO spectrum extends to ~1700 keV.\n    FLUX_CNO_IN_BAND = FLUX_CNO_TOTAL * (100 / 1700)\n    # B-8 spectrum extends to ~15000 keV.\n    FLUX_B8_IN_BAND = FLUX_B8_TOTAL * (100 / 15000)\n\n    # --- Calculate flux for each band based on active reactions ---\n    flux_band1 = 0.0\n    flux_band2 = 0.0\n\n    if active_reactions.get('CNO', False):\n        flux_band1 += FLUX_CNO_IN_BAND\n        flux_band2 += FLUX_CNO_IN_BAND\n\n    if active_reactions.get('pp-III', False):\n        flux_band1 += FLUX_B8_IN_BAND\n        flux_band2 += FLUX_B8_IN_BAND\n\n    # The Be-7 line at 861 keV is in Band 2.\n    if active_reactions.get('pp-II', False):\n        flux_band2 += FLUX_BE7_LINE\n\n    if flux_band2 == 0:\n        return float('inf') if flux_band1 > 0 else 0.0\n\n    return flux_band1 / flux_band2\n\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a series of tests on the calculate_neutrino_flux_ratio function.\n    \"\"\"\n    tests = []\n    \n    # Test 1: The actual problem scenario. pp-III is off.\n    scenario1 = {'pp-II': True, 'pp-III': False, 'CNO': True}\n    result1 = calculate_neutrino_flux_ratio(scenario1)\n    expected1 = 0.01\n    tests.append({\n        \"name\": \"Problem Scenario (pp-III off)\",\n        \"passed\": math.isclose(result1, expected1, rel_tol=0.5), # Allow 50% tolerance for approximation\n        \"result\": result1,\n        \"expected\": f\"~{expected1}\"\n    })\n\n    # Test 2: Hypothetical CNO-only scenario.\n    scenario2 = {'pp-II': False, 'pp-III': False, 'CNO': True}\n    result2 = calculate_neutrino_flux_ratio(scenario2)\n    expected2 = 1.0\n    tests.append({\n        \"name\": \"CNO Only\",\n        \"passed\": math.isclose(result2, expected2, rel_tol=1e-9),\n        \"result\": result2,\n        \"expected\": expected2\n    })\n\n    # Test 3: Hypothetical pp-II-only scenario.\n    scenario3 = {'pp-II': True, 'pp-III': False, 'CNO': False}\n    result3 = calculate_neutrino_flux_ratio(scenario3)\n    expected3 = 0.0\n    tests.append({\n        \"name\": \"pp-II Only\",\n        \"passed\": math.isclose(result3, expected3, abs_tol=1e-9),\n        \"result\": result3,\n        \"expected\": expected3\n    })\n\n    # Check results\n    for test in tests:\n        if not test[\"passed\"]:\n            print(f\"Test Failed: {test['name']}\")\n            print(f\"  - Expected: {test['expected']}\")\n            print(f\"  - Got: {test['result']}\")\n            return\n\n    # If all tests passed, print the answer to the main question\n    final_answer_value = tests[0]['result']\n    print(\"All tests passed\")\n    print(f\"The calculated ratio for the problem is: {final_answer_value:.4f}\")\n    # The closest option to 0.006 is 0.01.\n    print(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_tests()\n\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Excellent! The TDD process correctly identified the solution. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning behind the code and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Analyze the State of the Sun:** The problem states that the **pp-III branch has stopped**. This is the crucial piece of information. The pp-III branch is the reaction chain that produces high-energy Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos. With this branch off, there are no ⁸B neutrinos. All other reactions, specifically the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycles, are still active.\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Energy Band:** We need to determine which active reactions produce neutrinos in the two specified energy bands.\n\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   **pp-I (p-p, pep):** The main p-p neutrinos have energies < 420 keV. The `pep` reaction produces a line at 1.44 MeV. Neither contributes to this band.\n        *   **pp-II (⁷Be):** This branch produces a very strong, mono-energetic (single energy) line of neutrinos at **861 keV**. This is *outside* Band 1.\n        *   **pp-III (⁸B):** This branch is turned off.\n        *   **CNO Cycle:** This cycle produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum up to about 1.7 MeV. It **does** contribute a small amount of flux to this band.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only source of neutrinos is the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   **pp-II (⁷Be):** The strong neutrino line at **861 keV** falls squarely within this band. This is the dominant source of neutrinos in this energy range.\n        *   **CNO Cycle:** The continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle also contributes a small amount of flux here, similar to its contribution in Band 1.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is the sum of the CNO contribution *plus* the entire, very large flux from the ⁷Be line.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n\n    *   Flux (Band 1) = Flux from CNO\n    *   Flux (Band 2) = Flux from CNO + Flux from ⁷Be line\n\n    The ratio is:\n    `Ratio = (CNO Flux) / (CNO Flux + ⁷Be Flux)`\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes:**\n    *   From the Standard Solar Model (as used in the Python code's data):\n        *   The total flux from the ⁷Be line is enormous: ~5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n        *   The total flux from the CNO cycle is much smaller: ~5.2 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n    *   The CNO flux within a small 100 keV band is only a fraction of its total. As calculated in the code, this is roughly 3 x 10⁷.\n    *   Therefore, the flux from the ⁷Be line (~5 x 10⁹) is more than 100 times larger than the CNO flux in that band (~3 x 10⁷).\n    *   The ratio becomes `(small number) / (small number + very large number)`. The denominator is completely dominated by the \"very large number\" (the ⁷Be flux).\n\n    `Ratio ≈ (CNO Flux in band) / (⁷Be Flux) ≈ (3 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) ≈ 0.006`\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value of ~0.006 is very close to 0.01.\n\nThis logic is precisely what the TDD-driven Python script modeled. The test for the \"Problem Scenario\" correctly set `pp-III` to `False` and calculated the ratio based on the massive contribution of the `pp-II` (Be-7) flux to Band 2 and only the minor `CNO` flux to Band 1, leading to the small ratio.\n\n<<<D>>>"
