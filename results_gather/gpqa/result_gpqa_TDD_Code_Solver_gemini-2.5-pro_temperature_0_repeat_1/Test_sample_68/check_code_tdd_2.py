    m_GeV = 3.41       # Rest mass energy of particle X^0
    tau0_s = 8e-16     # Proper lifetime of particle X^0 in seconds

    # Interpretation of the question:
    # "observe at least 30% of the decays" means that for a detector with resolution 'd',
    # at least 30% of the particles must travel a distance greater than 'd' before decaying.
    # This is a survival probability problem.

    # We are looking for the minimum resolution 'd', so we solve for the equality:
    # P(distance > d) = 0.3
    survival_probability = 0.3

    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)
    # The Lorentz factor relates the energy and rest mass: E = gamma * m*c^2
    # Since E and m are given in the same units (GeV), gamma is their ratio.

    # 2. Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (L)
    # The decay law in terms of distance 'x' is P(x) = exp(-x/L), where L is the mean decay length.
    # L = v * tau_lab, where v is the particle's velocity and tau_lab is its lifetime in the lab frame.
    # tau_lab = gamma * tau0 (time dilation)

    # A more direct formula for L is: L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)

        return "Calculation Error: Cannot take square root of a negative number (gamma^2 - 1 < 0)."

    # 3. Calculate the required resolution distance (d)
    # We need to solve P(distance > d) = survival_probability for d.
    # exp(-d / mean_decay_length) = survival_probability
    # -d / mean_decay_length = ln(survival_probability)
