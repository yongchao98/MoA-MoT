    # The question asks to identify the experiment that will NOT help discover the mitochondrial role of a drug.
    # Let's analyze the options based on established biological principles.

    # Option A: Flow cytometry with JC-1 dye.
    # JC-1 measures mitochondrial membrane potential, a key indicator of mitochondrial health.
    # This is a valid and relevant experiment.

    # Option B: Glucose Uptake Assay on isolated mitochondria.
    # Mitochondria do not directly import or metabolize glucose. They import pyruvate,
    # which is produced from glucose in the cytoplasm via glycolysis.
    # This experiment is based on a flawed premise and is not relevant.

    # Option C: Luciferase assay.
    # This assay measures ATP levels. Mitochondria are the primary producers of cellular ATP.
    # This is a valid, though indirect, way to measure mitochondrial function.
    is_C_relevant = True

    # Option D: Mito-RTP staining.
    # "Mito-" indicates a mitochondria-targeted probe, used to measure a specific process
    # (like ROS production) directly within the mitochondria.
    # This is a valid and relevant experiment.
