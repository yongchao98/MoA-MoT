Here are the TDD steps to solve the problem.

1) List of tests:
*   **Test for Option A:** An experiment using JC-1 dye (5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide) measures mitochondrial membrane potential. This is a direct and relevant measure of mitochondrial health. The test should confirm this option is **relevant**.
*   **Test for Option B:** An experiment measuring glucose uptake by isolated mitochondria is fundamentally flawed. Mitochondria import pyruvate (the product of glycolysis in the cytoplasm), not glucose, for the Krebs cycle. The test should confirm this option is **not relevant**.
*   **Test for Option C:** An experiment using luciferase measures cellular ATP levels. Since mitochondria are the primary producers of ATP, this is a key, albeit indirect, indicator of mitochondrial function. The test should confirm this option is **relevant**.
*   **Test for Option D:** An experiment using a "Mito-" specific probe (Mito-RTP) localizes a measurement to the mitochondria. These probes typically measure byproducts of mitochondrial activity, like reactive oxygen species (ROS). The test should confirm this option is **relevant**.
*   **Test for Solution:** The final function should correctly identify and return the single option that is not relevant, which is 'B'.

2) Python implementation:
