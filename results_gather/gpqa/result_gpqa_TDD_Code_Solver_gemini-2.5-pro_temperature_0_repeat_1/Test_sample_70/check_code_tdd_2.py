    This function checks the correctness of the given answer for the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.
    
    The problem asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.
    
    The key physics principles are:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq): T_eq is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.
       T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - Albedo)^(1/4)
       For a ratio between two planets of the same star with the same albedo, this simplifies to:
       T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)

    2. Kepler's Third Law: The square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).
       P^2 ∝ a^3  =>  a ∝ P^(2/3)
       Therefore, a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)

    3. Combining these, we get the final formula for the temperature ratio:
       T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = [(P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)]^(1/2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)
