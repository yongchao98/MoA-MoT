def check_exoplanet_temperature_ratio():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer for the exoplanet temperature ratio problem.

    The core physics principles are:
    1. Kepler's Third Law: For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).
       (T_A / T_B)^2 = (a_A / a_B)^3  =>  (a_A / a_B) = (T_A / T_B)^(2/3)

    2. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq): For planets with the same albedo orbiting the same star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis.
       T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)  =>  (T_eq,A / T_eq,B) = sqrt(a_B / a_A)

    Combining these two principles:
    (T_eq,A / T_eq,B) = sqrt((T_B / T_A)^(2/3)) = (T_B / T_A)^(1/3)

    The question asks for the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2).
    Therefore, the formula is (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3).
