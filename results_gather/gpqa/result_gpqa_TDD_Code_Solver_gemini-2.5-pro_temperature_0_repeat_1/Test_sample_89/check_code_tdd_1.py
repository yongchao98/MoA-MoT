    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the organic chemistry question.

    1. Compares the problem statement in the user's question with the one solved by the LLM.
    2. Solves the user's original question step-by-step to determine the correct product and compares it to the LLM's selected option.

    # 2. Grignard Reaction (CH3CH2MgBr, H3O+): The ethyl Grignard adds to the aldehyde (1,2-addition).
