    # --- Define Biological Principles ---
    # 1. PFA is a short-range crosslinker, prone to capturing transient or weak interactions.
    # 2. PFA+DSG is a more stringent, dual-crosslinking method that stabilizes large protein complexes.
    # 3. Effect of a more stringent method on signals:
    #    - True signals (at functional sites) should be stabilized or enhanced.
    #    - Artifactual/weak signals should be reduced or eliminated.
    # 4. Known locations for different signal types:
    #    - True binding sites for a transcription factor like IKAROS are at active promoters and enhancers.
    #    - A primary source of ChIP-seq artifacts is high-copy genomic repeats due to non-specific binding.

    # --- Apply Logic to the Question ---
    # Observation: Peaks disappeared when moving from PFA (less stringent) to PFA+DSG (more stringent).
    # Inference: Based on principle #3, the disappearing peaks must represent artifactual or weak signals.
    inferred_peak_nature = "artifactual"

    # Question: Where are these artifactual peaks most likely located?
    # Conclusion: Based on principle #4, the most likely location for such artifacts is at repeats.
