    Question: Two compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, 
    sodium nitrite, and water. Through the mentioned treatment two different diketones are produced.
    Select the proper starting materials A and B for the reactions.
    A + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione
    B + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione

    Options:
    A) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one
    B) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol
    C) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one

    # --- Chemical Rationale ---
    # The reagent mixture (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) forms nitrous acid (HONO) in situ.
    # When reacted with a ketone that has an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the carbon
    # adjacent to the carbonyl group), it performs an alpha-oxidation.
    # The mechanism involves converting the alpha-CH2 group into a carbonyl group,
    # thus forming an alpha-diketone (a 1,2-diketone).
    # R-C(=O)-CH2-R'  --->  R-C(=O)-C(=O)-R'
    # Therefore, the starting material must be a ketone. Alcohols will not undergo this reaction.

    # --- Verification Logic ---
    
    # For Reaction A: to produce 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione
    # The starting material must be a ketone on the same ring.
    # The only logical precursor is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, which has an alpha-CH2 at position 2.
    correct_A = "4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one"

    # For Reaction B: to produce 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione
    # The starting material must be a ketone.
    # 5-methylhexan-2-one has an alpha-CH2 at position 3. This works.
    # 5-methylhexan-3-one has an alpha-CH2 at position 2. This would also work.
    # The option available in the choices is 5-methylhexan-2-one.
