    # 1. Calculate the moles of the conjugate acid (H2PO4-) and base (HPO4^2-)
    # Moles of KH2PO4 gives moles of H2PO4-
    moles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4
    # Moles of Na2HPO4*2H2O gives moles of HPO4^2-
    moles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o

    # 2. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components
    conc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L
    conc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L

    # 3. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)
    # Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4^-] / [HPO4^2-]
    # We can use the ratio of concentrations or moles, as the volume term cancels out.
    conc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)

    # 4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium
    # Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]
