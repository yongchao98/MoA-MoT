    volume_L = volume_cm3 / 1000.0

    # KH2PO4 provides the H2PO4- ions

    conc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L
    conc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L

    # 4. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equilibrium
    # The relevant equilibrium is: H2PO4^- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (governed by Ka2)
    # Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]
    # We can assume the initial concentrations are close to equilibrium concentrations.
    # [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]
    h_plus_conc = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)

    # 5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]
    # The relevant equilibrium is: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (governed by Ka3)
    # Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]
    # [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]
    calculated_po4_3minus_conc = ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_conc)

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated value is close to the expected answer from option C.
    # A relative tolerance of 2% is reasonable to account for rounding in the options.
