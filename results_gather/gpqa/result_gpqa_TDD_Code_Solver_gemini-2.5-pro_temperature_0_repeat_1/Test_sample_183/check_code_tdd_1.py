    Evaluates four multi-step synthesis options to find the one that can produce
    2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene in high yield.

    The function checks for common fatal flaws in synthesis design:
    1. Reactions that do not work under the given conditions (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on deactivated rings).
    2. Reactions that require a specific functional group that is not present.
    3. Reactions that lack regioselectivity, leading to low yields of the desired isomer.
    4. Illogical sequences of steps.

    # via a blocking group strategy if the order is corrected.
    # Plausible corrected path: i -> ii -> iii -> iv -> v -> vii -> vi -> viii -> ix
    # This path uses sulfonation (ii) to block the para position, allowing controlled
    # substitutions, and then desulfonation (viii) to remove the blocking group.
    # This is the only set of reagents that can achieve the target 1,2,3-substitution pattern.
