    # Step ii produces aniline. Step iii is a Friedel-Crafts reaction on aniline.
    # This is a known reaction failure. The Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the
    # basic amine group, deactivating the ring.
    flaws['B'] = "Invalid: Option B fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings substituted with a basic amine group like aniline."

    # Sequence: i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...
    # Step iv is a diazotization reaction. This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2).
    # The substrate after step iii is a substituted benzene with -tBu, -NO2, and -SO3H groups, but no amine.
    flaws['C'] = "Invalid: Option C fails at step (iv). Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) requires a primary aromatic amine, which is not present in the molecule at that stage."

    # Sequence: i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...
    # Step iii produces 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. Step iv is the nitration of this compound.
    # In the strong acid of nitration, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, a meta-director.
    # The t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director.
    # For 2-(tert-butyl)anilinium (tBu at C1, NH3+ at C2), both groups direct to positions 4 and 6.
    # The target product requires a 1,2,3 substitution pattern, which this step cannot produce selectively.

    # All three options B, C, and D have been shown to contain fatal chemical flaws.
