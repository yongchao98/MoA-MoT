    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution:\n\n1.  **Test Reaction A:** The reaction of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions (t-BuOK) is a Michael addition. The only possible enolate forms at the C6 position. This enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The resulting product's IUPAC name should be `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n2.  **Test Reaction B:** The reaction of 1-nitropropane with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH is a Michael addition. The carbanion forms at the α-carbon (C1) of 1-nitropropane and attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. The resulting product's IUPAC name should be `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n3.  **Test Option Selection:** Based on the predicted products from the tests above, the correct option from the multiple-choice list must be identified. The combination of `A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` and `B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile` corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_organic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the major products of two chemical reactions\n    and selects the correct option from a list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Reaction A Analysis ---\n    # Reactants: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n    # Reaction Type: Michael Addition\n    # Nucleophile formation: The ketone has two alpha-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    # C2 is quaternary and has no alpha-hydrogens.\n    # C6 is tertiary and has one alpha-hydrogen.\n    # The strong, bulky base t-BuOK can only deprotonate C6 to form the enolate.\n    # Michael addition: The C6 enolate attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    # Product Naming: The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    # The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    # To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the attachment point (original C6) is C1'.\n    # The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent, so it's at C2' (2-oxo).\n    # The ethyl and methyl group (original C2) are at C3' (3-ethyl, 3-methyl).\n    # The methyl group on the attachment carbon (original C6) is at C1' (1-methyl).\n    # Combining these gives the substituent name: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    product_A_name = \"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\"\n\n    # --- Reaction B Analysis ---\n    # Reactants: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n    # Reaction Type: Michael Addition\n    # Nucleophile formation: KOH deprotonates the acidic alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    # The nucleophile is the anion of 1-nitropropane: CH3-CH2-CH(-)-NO2.\n    # Michael addition: The nucleophile attacks the beta-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH3-CH=CH-CN).\n    # Product Structure: CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN\n    # Product Naming: The parent chain is the longest chain including the nitrile carbon.\n    # Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    # CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)\n    # This is a hexanenitrile chain.\n    # Substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    product_B_name = \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"\n\n    # --- Option Matching ---\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"),\n        \"B\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\"),\n        \"C\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\"),\n        \"D\": (\"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\", \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"),\n    }\n\n    final_answer = None\n    for option, (name_A, name_B) in options.items():\n        if product_A_name == name_A and product_B_name == name_B:\n            final_answer = option\n            break\n            \n    return product_A_name, product_B_name, final_answer\n\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs tests based on the defined logic and prints the outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Expected results from our manual analysis\n    expected_A = \"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\"\n    expected_B = \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"\n    expected_final = 'A'\n\n    # Get results from the solution function\n    try:\n        actual_A, actual_B, actual_final = solve_organic_reactions()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred during solution execution: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    # Test 1: Check Product A\n    if actual_A != expected_A:\n        print(f\"Test Failed: Product A\")\n        print(f\"  Expected: {expected_A}\")\n        print(f\"  Got: {actual_A}\")\n        return\n\n    # Test 2: Check Product B\n    if actual_B != expected_B:\n        print(f\"Test Failed: Product B\")\n        print(f\"  Expected: {expected_B}\")\n        print(f\"  Got: {actual_B}\")\n        return\n\n    # Test 3: Check Final Answer\n    if actual_final != expected_final:\n        print(f\"Test Failed: Final Answer\")\n        print(f\"  Expected: {expected_final}\")\n        print(f\"  Got: {actual_final}\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"All tests passed\\nThe correct option is: {actual_final}\")\n\n# Execute the tests\nrun_tests()\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "An excellent demonstration of Test-Driven Development.

The strong, bulky base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the less substituted α-carbon (C6), as the C2 position is quaternary (no α-hydrogens).\n*   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Attack:** The C6-enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n*   **Product:** The resulting product is correctly identified as `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n**Reaction B: Michael Addition**\n*   **Nucleophile:** The carbanion of 1-nitropropane, formed by deprotonation of the acidic α-carbon by KOH.\n*   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile).\n*   **Attack:** The α-carbon of the nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n*   **Product:** Following IUPAC nomenclature for the resulting structure (`CH3CH2CH(NO2)CH(CH3)CH2CN`), the product is correctly named `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nYour code successfully implements this logic and confirms that option A contains the correct names for both products.\n\nWell done"
