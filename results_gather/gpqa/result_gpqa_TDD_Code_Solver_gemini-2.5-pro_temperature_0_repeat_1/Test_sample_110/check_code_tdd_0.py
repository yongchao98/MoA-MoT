    # Analysis of Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)
    # This is a Michael addition. The only possible enolate forms at the C6 position, as C2 is quaternary.
    # This enolate attacks ethyl acrylate.
    # The resulting product's IUPAC name is derived as follows:
    # - Parent chain: ethyl propanoate.
    # - Substituent at C3: the cyclohexanone ring.
    # - Naming the substituent ring: Attachment point (original C6) is C1'. Carbonyl is at C2'.
    #   The ethyl and methyl groups are at C3'. The methyl on the attachment carbon is at C1'.
    # - Full name: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

    # This is a Michael addition. The carbanion forms at the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane.
    # This carbanion attacks the beta-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.
    # The resulting product's IUPAC name is derived as follows:
    # - Parent chain: Longest chain including the nitrile carbon is 6 carbons -> hexanenitrile.
    # - Numbering from the nitrile carbon (C1): CN(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6).
    # - Substituents: methyl at C3, nitro at C4.
