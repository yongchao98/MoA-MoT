    # The question asks which of Maxwell's equations would change if magnetic monopoles existed.
    # The provided answer is 'A'.

    # Physics Analysis:
    # 1. Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0) states there are no magnetic monopoles.
    #    If monopoles existed, this law would change to ∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρ_m.
    #    This law describes the DIVERGENCE of the magnetic field.
    #
    # 2. Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t) describes how a changing magnetic field
    #    creates a curling electric field. If magnetic monopoles could move, they would
    #    create a magnetic current (J_m), which would also induce a curling electric field.
    #    The law would change to ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀J_m.
    #    This law describes the CIRCULATION (curl) of the electric field.
    #
    # 3. The other two equations (Gauss's Law for Electricity and Ampere-Maxwell Law)
    #    are not directly modified by the existence of magnetic monopoles.

    # Therefore, the two laws that change are related to:
    # - The divergence of the magnetic field.
    # - The circulation of the electric field.

            reason += "This option is incomplete. While the law for the divergence of the magnetic field changes, the law for the circulation of the electric field also changes."
        elif llm_answer == 'C':
            reason += "This is incorrect. The laws for the flux of the electric field (Gauss's Law for E) and the circulation of the magnetic field (Ampere-Maxwell Law) are the two that remain unchanged."
        elif llm_answer == 'D':
            reason += "This is incorrect. The law for the curl/circulation of the magnetic field (Ampere-Maxwell Law) does not change, but the law for the circulation of the electric field (Faraday's Law) does."
        else:
            reason += f"The correct answer is 'A' because the existence of magnetic monopoles would modify Gauss's Law for Magnetism (divergence of B) and Faraday's Law (circulation of E)."
