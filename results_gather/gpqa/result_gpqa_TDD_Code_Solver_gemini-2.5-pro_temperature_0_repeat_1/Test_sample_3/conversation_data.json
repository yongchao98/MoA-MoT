    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution:\n1.  **Typical Case**: The function should correctly identify 'A' as the answer, as the presence of magnetic monopoles modifies both Gauss's law for magnetism (divergence of B) and Faraday's law (curl/circulation of E).\n2.  **Edge Case (Negative Test 1)**: The function should not return 'B', as this option is incomplete.\n3.  **Edge Case (Negative Test 2)**: The function should not return 'C', as the laws related to the E-field flux and B-field circulation are unaffected.\n4.  **Edge Case (Negative Test 3)**: The function should not return 'D', as the law related to the B-field circulation is unaffected.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_maxwell_monopole_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which of Maxwell's equations would change if magnetic monopoles existed.\n\n    In standard physics (integral form for intuition, differential form for precision):\n    1. Gauss's Law for Electricity (Flux of E): ∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀. Unchanged. Relates electric field flux to electric charge.\n    2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Flux of B): ∇ ⋅ B = 0. This means no magnetic monopoles. If monopoles (magnetic charges) existed, this law would change to ∇ ⋅ B ≠ 0, becoming symmetric with the electric version. This law describes the DIVERGENCE of the magnetic field.\n    3. Faraday's Law of Induction (Circulation of E): ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. This relates a changing magnetic field to a curling electric field. If magnetic monopoles could move (creating a magnetic current), they would induce a curling electric field, adding a magnetic current term to this equation. This law describes the CIRCULATION of the electric field.\n    4. Ampère-Maxwell Law (Circulation of B): ∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t). Unchanged. Relates magnetic field circulation to electric currents and changing electric fields.\n\n    Therefore, the two equations that change are Gauss's Law for Magnetism (divergence of B) and Faraday's Law (circulation of E).
