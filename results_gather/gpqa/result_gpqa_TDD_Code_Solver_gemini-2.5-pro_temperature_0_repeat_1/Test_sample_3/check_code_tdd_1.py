    # The core physical principles:
    # 1. A static magnetic monopole is a magnetic charge (source/sink for B-field).
    #    This implies that the divergence of the magnetic field (div B) is no longer zero.
    #    This modifies Gauss's Law for Magnetism.
    #
    # 2. A moving magnetic monopole constitutes a magnetic current.
    #    By symmetry with electromagnetism, a magnetic current should create a circulating
    #    electric field, just as an electric current creates a circulating magnetic field.
    #    This adds a new term to Faraday's Law of Induction, which describes the
    #    circulation (curl) of the electric field (curl E).

    # Define the concepts that are affected by magnetic monopoles.

        "divergence of the magnetic field",
        "circulation of the electric field"
