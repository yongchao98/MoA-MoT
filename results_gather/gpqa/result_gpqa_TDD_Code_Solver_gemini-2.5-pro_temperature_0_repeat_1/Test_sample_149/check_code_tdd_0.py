    # --- Problem Data ---

    # --- Chemical Logic Verification ---

    # Step 1: Deduce the starting material.
    # The molecular formula C8H9NO and NMR data (para-substituted ring, -NH2 group, -CH2CHO group)
    # unambiguously point to 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The LLM's deduction is correct.
    starting_material = "4-aminophenylacetaldehyde"

    # Step 2: Deduce the intermediate after reagents 1 (NaNO2/HCl) and 2 (H2O).
    # This is a standard Sandmeyer-type reaction sequence that converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2)
    # into a hydroxyl group (-OH) via a diazonium salt intermediate.
    intermediate = "4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde"

    # Step 3: Deduce the final product after reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat).
    # The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde and alpha-protons.
    # The conditions (strong base + heat) are classic for a self-aldol condensation.
    # The reaction proceeds in two stages:
    # a) Aldol Addition: Forms a beta-hydroxy aldehyde. In this case, it would be
    #    3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D).
    # b) Dehydration: The presence of "Heat" is a key condition that drives the elimination
    #    of water from the addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system.
    # The final, dehydrated product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.
    final_product_name = "2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal"

    # Step 4: Match the deduced final product with the options.
