    "Here is a Test-Driven Development approach to solving the problem.\n\n### 1. Tests\nHere are a few small, explicit tests the solution should satisfy:\n1.  **Test 1: Starting Material Identification.** The function should correctly identify the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and NMR data as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n2.  **Test 2: Intermediate Product Identification.** After reacting the starting material with NaNO2/HCl and then H2O/Heat, the function should correctly identify the intermediate as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This involves a diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n3.  **Test 3: Final Product Identification.** After reacting the intermediate with aqueous KOH and heat, the function should correctly identify the final product. This is an aldol condensation reaction, and due to the heat, the dehydrated product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, is expected.\n4.  **Test 4: Final Answer Mapping.** The identified final product must correspond to one of the given multiple-choice options. The name \"2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\" matches option C.\n\n### 2.
