    # Part A: Identify the reactant A.
    # The reaction is a [2+2] cycloaddition of a ketene to cyclohexene.
    # The product's substituents (diiodo, one) on the new 4-membered ring
    # point to the reactant being 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one (I2C=C=O).

    # Part B: Determine the diene reactivity order.
    # The order is based on the ability to form the s-cis conformation.
    # 3 (cyclopenta-1,3-diene) is locked s-cis -> most reactive.
    # 1 (2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene) has EDGs and easily forms s-cis -> very reactive.
    # 2 ((2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene) can form s-cis -> reactive.
    # 4 ((2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene) has severe steric hindrance in s-cis -> least reactive.
