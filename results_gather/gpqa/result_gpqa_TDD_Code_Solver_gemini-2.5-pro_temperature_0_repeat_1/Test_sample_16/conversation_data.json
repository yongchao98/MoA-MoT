    "Here are the steps to solve the problem using Test-Driven Development.\n\n### 1) TDD Tests\n\n1.  **Test 1 (Main Problem):** Given an initial complex concentration of 0.02 M and a formation constant (K_f) of 5x10¹⁰, the resulting free Ca²⁺ ion concentration should be approximately 6.32x10⁻⁷ M.\n2.  **Test 2 (Different Concentration):** If the initial complex concentration is 0.1 M with the same K_f, the dissociation equilibrium `x² / 0.1 ≈ 1 / (5x10¹⁰)` should yield a Ca²⁺ concentration of approximately 1.41x10⁻⁶ M.\n3.  **Test 3 (Different K_f):** If the initial complex concentration is 0.02 M but the K_f is weaker, say 1x10⁸, the dissociation equilibrium `x² / 0.02 ≈ 1 / (1x10⁸)` should yield a Ca²⁺ concentration of approximately 1.41x10⁻⁵ M.\n\n### 2) Python Implementation and Tests\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_dissociated_ion_concentration(initial_complex_conc, k_formation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the concentration of free ions from the dissociation of a stable complex.\n\n    The reaction is Complex <=> Ion1 + Ion2.\n    We start with a solution of the complex and it dissociates slightly.\n    Let x be the concentration of the dissociated ions at equilibrium.\n    K_dissociation = 1 / K_formation\n    K_dissociation = [Ion1][Ion2] / [Complex]\n    K_dissociation = (x * x) / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n\n    Since K_formation is very large, K_dissociation is very small, meaning x is\n    very small compared to the initial concentration.\n    We can approximate (initial_complex_conc - x) ≈ initial_complex_conc.\n    So, K_dissociation ≈ x^2 / initial_complex_conc\n    x^2 ≈ K_dissociation * initial_complex_conc\n    x = sqrt(K_dissociation * initial_complex_conc)\n\n    Args:\n        initial_complex_conc (float): The initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex.\n        k_formation (float): The formation constant of the complex.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The equilibrium concentration of the dissociated ion.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k_formation == 0:\n        return initial_complex_conc # Complete dissociation\n    if initial_complex_conc == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    k_dissociation = 1 / k_formation\n    # x = sqrt(k_d * C)\n    ion_concentration = math.sqrt(k_dissociation * initial_complex_conc)\n    return ion_concentration\n\n# --- Tests ---\ntests = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Test 1: Main Problem\",\n        \"inputs\": {\"initial_complex_conc\": 0.02, \"k_formation\": 5e10},\n        \"expected\": 6.3245e-7\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Test 2: Different Concentration\",\n        \"inputs\": {\"initial_complex_conc\": 0.1, \"k_formation\": 5e10},\n        \"expected\": 1.4142e-6\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Test 3: Different K_f\",\n        \"inputs\": {\"initial_complex_conc\": 0.02, \"k_formation\": 1e8},\n        \"expected\": 1.4142e-5\n    }\n]\n\n# --- Test Runner ---\nall_passed = True\nfor i, test in enumerate(tests):\n    inputs = test[\"inputs\"]\n    expected = test[\"expected\"]\n    result = calculate_dissociated_ion_concentration(**inputs)\n\n    if not math.isclose(result, expected, rel_tol=1e-3):\n        print(f\"--- Test Failed: {test['name']} ---\")\n        print(f\"Input: {inputs}\")\n        print(f\"Expected: {expected:.4e}\")\n        print(f\"Got: {result:.4e}\")\n        all_passed = False\n        break\n\nif all_passed:\n    # Calculate the final answer for the user's question\n    final_answer_val = calculate_dissociated_ion_concentration(0.02, 5e10)\n    print(\"All tests passed\")\n    print(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is: {final_answer_val:.1e} M\")\n    # The calculated value 6.3e-7 M corresponds to option D.\n    print(\"<<<D>>>\")\n\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
