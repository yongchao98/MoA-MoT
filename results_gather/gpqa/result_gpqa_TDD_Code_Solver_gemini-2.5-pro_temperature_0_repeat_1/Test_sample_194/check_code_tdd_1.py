    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the astronomy problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum orbital period of a second planet (P2)
    that exhibits transit and occultation events.

    Key logical steps:
    1.  A transit event, by standard definition, occurs when the center of the
        planet passes in front of the star's disk. The impact parameter 'b' is
        the projected distance between the centers, normalized by the star's radius.
        Therefore, a transit occurs for 0 <= b <= 1.
    2.  The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major
        axis 'a' for which a transit can still occur.
    3.  The relationship between impact parameter 'b' and semi-major axis 'a' is
        b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star, where 'i' is the orbital inclination and
        R_star is the stellar radius.
    4.  Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, their inclination 'i'
        is the same. R_star is also the same. Thus, 'b' is directly proportional
        to 'a'. To maximize 'a' for P2, we must maximize its impact parameter, b2.
    5.  The maximum impact parameter for a transit to occur is b2_max = 1 (a grazing
        transit of the planet's center).
    6.  From the proportionality, we get a2/a1 = b2/b1. For the maximum period,
        we use a2_max/a1 = b2_max/b1.
    7.  Kepler's Third Law states (T^2 / a^3) = constant for the system.
        This gives T2/T1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2).
    8.  Combining these, we can calculate the maximum period for P2 (T2_max). The
        radii of the star and planets are extraneous information if this interpretation
        is used, which is common in such problems.
