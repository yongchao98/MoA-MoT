    "Here is the solution using a Test-Driven Development approach.\n\n### 1. Tests\nHere are a few small, explicit tests the solution should satisfy:\n\n1.  **Test 1: Identify Reagent A Type.** The reaction involves a secondary amine (3-methylpyrrolidine) and forms an enamine product. This type of reaction, an enamine synthesis, requires a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or a ketone) as the reaction partner. The function should correctly identify that `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` is a carbonyl compound, while `vinylcyclohexane` is an alkene and thus unsuitable.\n2.  **Test 2: Identify Catalyst B Type.** The formation of an enamine from an amine and a carbonyl compound is a condensation reaction that involves the elimination of water. This dehydration step is acid-catalyzed. The function should recognize that both TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) and Acetic acid are acid catalysts.\n3.  **Test 3: Select the Best Catalyst.** While both acids can catalyze the reaction, TsOH is a strong, non-nucleophilic acid commonly used with a Dean-Stark apparatus (implied by \"Heat\") to drive dehydration reactions to completion. It is a more standard and effective choice for this specific transformation than the weaker acetic acid. The function should prefer TsOH.\n4.  **Test 4: Final Selection.** Based on the identification of the correct reagent type (aldehyde) and the most suitable catalyst (TsOH), the function should select the correct final option from the list.\n\n### 2. Python Implementation\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_reaction_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction to select the correct reagent (A) and catalyst (B).\n\n    The reaction is the acid-catalyzed formation of an enamine from a secondary amine.\n    Reactants: 3-methylpyrrolidine (secondary amine) + A\n    Product: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine (an enamine)\n    Conditions: Catalyst B, Heat\n\n    Logic:\n    1.  Identify the reaction type: The reaction of a secondary amine to form a product\n        containing a N-C=C bond is an enamine synthesis.\n    2.  Identify Reagent A: Enamine synthesis requires a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone).\n        - cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde.\n        - vinylcyclohexane is an alkene.\n        Therefore, A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This eliminates options B and D.\n    3.  Identify Catalyst B: The reaction is a dehydration, which is acid-catalyzed.\n        - TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid catalyst.\n        - Acetic acid is a weak acid catalyst.\n        Both are possible, but TsOH is a very common and effective catalyst for driving these\n        dehydrations to completion, especially with heat to remove the water byproduct.\n        It is considered the superior choice for this transformation.\n    4.  Conclusion: The best combination is A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\"A\": \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\", \"B\": \"TsOH\"},\n        \"B\": {\"A\": \"vinylcyclohexane\", \"B\": \"TsOH\"},\n        \"C\": {\"A\": \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\", \"B\": \"Acetic acid\"},\n        \"D\": {\"A\": \"vinylcyclohexane\", \"B\": \"Acetic acid\"},\n    }\n\n    # Logic implementation\n    # 1.
