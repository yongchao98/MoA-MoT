    # --- Chemical Analysis ---

    # 1. Analyze the reaction type.
    # The reactant 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine.
    # The product 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine is an enamine (N-C=C).
    # This reaction is an enamine synthesis, which requires a carbonyl compound and an acid catalyst.

    # 2. Determine the required Reagent A.
    # For an enamine synthesis, reagent A must be a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone).
    # - 'cyclohexanecarbaldehyde' is an aldehyde (a carbonyl compound).
    # - 'vinylcyclohexane' is an alkene (not a carbonyl compound).
    # Therefore, Reagent A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This eliminates options B and D.
    correct_reagent_A = "cyclohexanecarbaldehyde"

    # 3. Determine the most suitable Catalyst B.
    # The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration. "Heat" suggests a need to drive the reaction to completion.
    # - 'TsOH' (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid, a standard and highly effective catalyst for this type of dehydration.
    # - 'Acetic acid' is a weak acid and less effective for driving the reaction to completion.
    # Therefore, TsOH is the superior catalyst.
    correct_catalyst_B = "TsOH"

    # 4. Conclude the correct option.
    # The correct combination is A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH.
    # This corresponds to option 'A'.
    derived_correct_option = "A"
