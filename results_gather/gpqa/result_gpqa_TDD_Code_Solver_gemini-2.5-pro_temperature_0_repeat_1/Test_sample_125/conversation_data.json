    "Here is the step-by-step solution using Test-Driven Development.\n\n### 1. Tests\nHere are the small, explicit tests the solution must satisfy:\n1.  **Test Reaction I Products:** The reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has one chiral center, at the prochiral ketone C3 should yield two diastereomeric alcohol products.\n2.  **Test Reaction II Products:** The reduction of the achiral pentane-2,4-dione should yield three stereoisomeric diol products: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n3.  **Test Chiral HPLC Separation:** A chiral HPLC column should separate all unique stereoisomers. For the combined mixture, this means separating the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (enantiomeric pair + meso) from Reaction II, for a total of 5 peaks.\n4.  **Test Normal-Phase HPLC Separation:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers but does not separate enantiomers. For the combined mixture, this means:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I are separated (2 peaks).\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair co-elutes (1 peak), and the meso compound, being a diastereomer to the pair, separates (1 peak).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different and will separate.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = 4 peaks.\n5.  **Test Final Answer:** The final calculated result must be 5 peaks for chiral HPLC and 4 peaks for normal-phase HPLC, corresponding to option A.\n\n### 2.
