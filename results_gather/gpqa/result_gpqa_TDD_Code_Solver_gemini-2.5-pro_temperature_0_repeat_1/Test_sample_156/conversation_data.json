    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution:\n\n1.  **Test Case 1 (Correct Path):** The chosen method must be appropriate for a retrovirus. A retrovirus has an RNA genome, so the process must involve converting RNA to cDNA (via reverse transcription). The final kit should be for rapid and accurate detection, making real-time PCR a prime candidate. Option B fits this perfectly.\n2.  **Test Case 2 (Incorrect Genome):** A method starting with direct DNA sequencing of the virus is incorrect because retroviruses have RNA genomes. Therefore, option D must be rejected.\n3.  **Test Case 3 (Incorrect Target):** A method targeting IgG antibodies is suboptimal for *quick* diagnosis of a *new* outbreak. IgG indicates a later-stage or past infection, not an early, active one. Therefore, option A must be rejected.\n4.  **Test Case 4 (Incorrect Identification Method):** A method that relies on patient symptoms to identify the virus for molecular kit design is scientifically unsound. Symptoms are often non-specific. Therefore, option C must be rejected.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_diagnostic_kit_design():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the options for designing a diagnostic kit for a retrovirus.\n\n    A retrovirus has an RNA genome and uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase to create\n    a DNA copy of its genome, which is then integrated into the host cell's DNA.\n\n    Let's evaluate the options based on this biological fact:\n    - A) IgG antibodies are produced later in an infection. For a *quick* diagnosis\n      during a new outbreak, detecting the virus's genetic material is faster and\n      more direct than waiting for a specific type of antibody response.\n    - B) This is the correct pathway. Since it's an RNA virus, its genetic material\n      must first be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) for sequencing and\n      amplification. Real-time PCR (specifically, RT-qPCR) is the gold standard\n      for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of viral RNA.\n    - C) Identifying a virus based on symptoms is not precise enough to design a\n      specific molecular test. Different viruses can cause similar symptoms.\n    - D) This is incorrect because a retrovirus has an RNA genome, not a DNA genome.\n      Direct DNA sequencing is not the correct initial step.\n\n    Therefore, option B is the most scientifically sound and practical approach.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 'B'\n\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs all tests and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Test 1: The primary correct case for a retrovirus\n        solution = solve_diagnostic_kit_design()\n        assert solution == 'B', \"Test Case 1 Failed: The correct method for a retrovirus was not selected.\"\n\n        # Test 2: Rejection of incorrect genome type (DNA)\n        # This test asserts that the logic correctly identifies that D is wrong.\n        assert solution != 'D', \"Test Case 2 Failed: Should not select a method for a DNA virus.\"\n\n        # Test 3: Rejection of suboptimal antibody target (IgG)\n        # This test asserts that the logic correctly identifies that A is wrong for quick diagnosis.\n        assert solution != 'A', \"Test Case 3 Failed: Should not select a late-stage antibody target for an early outbreak.\"\n\n        # Test 4: Rejection of non-specific identification method (symptoms)\n        # This test asserts that the logic correctly identifies that C is wrong.\n        assert solution != 'C', \"Test Case 4 Failed: Should not rely on symptoms for molecular kit design.\"\n\n        print(f\"All tests passed\\nThe final answer is {solution}\")\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        # Get the line number of the failing test\n        _, _, tb = sys.exc_info()\n        line_number = tb.tb_lineno\n        print(f\"Test failed on line {line_number}: {e}\")\n\n# Execute the tests\nrun_tests()\n```\n<<<B>>>",
