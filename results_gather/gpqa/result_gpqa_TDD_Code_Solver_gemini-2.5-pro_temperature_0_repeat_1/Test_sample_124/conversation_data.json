    "Here are the steps for solving the problem using Test-Driven Development.\n\n**1) Test Cases**\n\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** The lowest energy state. The principal quantum number `n` is 0. The energy should be `(0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω`. The degeneracy should be `(0+1)(0+2)/2 = 1`.\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):** The next energy level. The principal quantum number `n` is 1. The energy should be `(1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω`. The degeneracy should be `(1+1)(1+2)/2 = 3`.\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):** The principal quantum number `n` is 2. The energy should be `(2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω`. The degeneracy should be `(2+1)(2+2)/2 = 6`.\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3, the problem's target):** The principal quantum number `n` is 3.

    "Excellent! The Test-Driven Development process was successful. The code correctly implemented the formulas for the energy levels and degeneracy of the three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator, and all tests passed, leading to the correct solution.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy eigenvalues are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the principal quantum number.\n2.  **Excited States:**\n    *   Ground State: $n=0$\n    *   First Excited State: $n=1$\n    *   Second Excited State: $n=2$\n    *   Third Excited State: $n=3$\n3.  **Energy of the Third Excited State:** For the third excited state, we set $n=3$:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n4.  **Degeneracy:** The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level $E_n$ (i.e., the degeneracy $g_n$) is given by the formula $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n5.  **Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** For $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThe energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
