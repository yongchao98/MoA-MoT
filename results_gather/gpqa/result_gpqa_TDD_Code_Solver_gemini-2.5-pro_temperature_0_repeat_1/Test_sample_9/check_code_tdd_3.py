def check_exoplanet_density():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer about exoplanet density.

    The core principle is that for a rocky planet of a given composition,
    density increases with mass due to gravitational self-compression.
    A common approximation for the mass-radius relationship is R ∝ M^β.
    This leads to a density-mass relationship: ρ = M/V ∝ M / R^3 ∝ M / (M^β)^3 = M^(1-3β).

    The explanation provides calculated densities for planets 'c' and 'd'. We can use these
    to determine the model's exponent and verify the conclusion.
