    # Step 1: Define the properties of the relevant compounds based on the reaction sequence.
    # C: Propyne
    # D: Mesitylene (1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene)
    # F: 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline
    # H: 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol

    # Step 2: Evaluate each statement based on established chemical principles.

    # Statement A: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.
    # D is Mesitylene. Due to its high symmetry, it has two sets of equivalent protons:
    # 1. The 3 aromatic protons.
    # 2. The 9 methyl protons.
    # Neither group has adjacent non-equivalent protons, so both signals are singlets.
    is_A_correct = True

    # Statement B: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
    # F is 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline, an aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are foundational
    # starting materials for diazonium salts, which are used to produce azo dyes.
    is_B_correct = True

    # Statement C: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.
    # H is 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol. The characteristic positive test for phenols with neutral FeCl3
    # gives a violet, blue, or green color due to complex formation.
    # A yellow color is the color of the FeCl3 reagent itself and indicates a negative test,
    # which is expected for a sterically hindered phenol like H.
    # The statement that H "gives" a yellow color is misleading and chemically incorrect
    # because it implies a positive reaction result, rather than a failure to react.
    is_C_correct = False

    # Statement D: C is a flammable gas.
    # C is propyne (CH3C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C.
    # At standard room temperature (e.g., 25 °C), it is a gas.
    # Like other small alkynes, it is flammable.
    is_D_correct = True

    # Step 3: Verify the provided answer 'C'.
    # The question asks for the INCORRECT statement.
    # Our analysis shows A, B, and D are correct, and C is incorrect.
    # Therefore, the answer 'C' correctly identifies the incorrect statement.
