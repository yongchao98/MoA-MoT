    # --- Define the problem's constraints from the question ---
    # The mutation is in a heterozygote (one WT allele, one mutant allele).
    # The protein must form a dimer to function.
    # The mutation is "dominant-negative".
    
    # --- Define the properties of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimerizing protein ---
    # 1. "Dominant": The phenotype is NOT wild-type in a heterozygote.
    # 2. "Negative": The phenotype is a loss-of-function, NOT a gain-of-function.
    # 3. Mechanism: The mutant protein product interferes with the wild-type protein product.
    #    This leads to a "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele" because the WT protein is sequestered into non-functional complexes.
    # 4. Common Consequence: Non-functional or misfolded protein complexes are often targeted for degradation by the cell.

    # Reason: This aligns perfectly. "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele" is the definition of the dominant-negative mechanism in this context.
    # "protein degradation" is a very common and plausible consequence for such non-functional complexes.

    # Option C: protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype
    is_C_correct = False
    reason_C = "Incorrect. While the phenotype is a loss-of-function, the primary mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimer is interference with the wild-type partner. Option B describes this interference more accurately as 'loss-of-function of the wild-type allele'. Aggregation is a possible but less specific mechanism."
