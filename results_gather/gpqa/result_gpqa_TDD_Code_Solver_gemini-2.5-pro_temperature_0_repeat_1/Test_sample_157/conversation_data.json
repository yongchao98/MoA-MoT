    "Here are the tests for the biological problem, based on the principles of molecular genetics.\n\n1.  **Test Case 1 (The user's question):** A heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in a dimerization domain should interfere with the wild-type protein, causing a loss of function of the wild-type allele's product. This corresponds to option B.\n2.  **Test Case 2 (Recessive Mutation):** A heterozygous recessive loss-of-function mutation (like mutation X in the prompt) should result in a wild-type phenotype, as the single functional allele is sufficient. This helps rule out option D.\n3.  **Test Case 3 (Gain-of-Function):** A gain-of-function mutation would lead to a gain-of-function phenotype, which is distinct from the dominant-negative effect. This helps rule out option A.\n4.  **Test Case 4 (Aggregation):** While protein aggregation can cause a loss-of-function, the most direct mechanism for a dominant-negative effect in a *dimerizing* protein is interference with the wild-type partner, not necessarily forming large aggregates. The correct answer should be more specific. This helps distinguish B from C.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_transcription_factor_mutation(mutation_type, domain, zygosity):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the phenotype of a transcription factor mutation based on its properties.\n\n    Args:\n        mutation_type (str): 'dominant-negative', 'recessive_loss_of_function', 'gain_of_function'.\n        domain (str): The protein domain affected, e.g., 'dimerization'.\n        zygosity (str): 'heterozygous' or 'homozygous'.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The letter corresponding to the most likely molecular phenotype.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dominant-negative mutation in a protein that must form a dimer is a classic case.\n    # The mutant protein binds to and \"poisons\" the wild-type protein from the other allele.\n    # This prevents the wild-type protein from functioning, effectively causing a\n    # \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\".\n    if mutation_type == 'dominant-negative' and domain == 'dimerization' and zygosity == 'heterozygous':\n        # A) gain-of-function is incorrect.\n        # C) aggregation is a possible but less specific mechanism.

    "Excellent! The TDD process correctly identified the principles of dominant-negative mutations.\n\n### Reasoning Confirmation\n\n1.  **Dominant-Negative Effect:** The term itself provides the answer. \"Dominant\" means the mutation has an effect even in a heterozygote (with one wild-type allele). \"Negative\" means this effect is a loss of function.\n2.  **Mechanism in Dimerization:** For a protein that must form a dimer to function, a dominant-negative mutation often occurs in the dimerization domain. The faulty mutant protein subunit binds to the normal, wild-type subunit. This creates a non-functional heterodimer, effectively \"poisoning\" or inactivating the protein produced by the good allele.\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) is incorrect because the phenotype is a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n    *   **B) is correct** because the mutant protein causes a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" by interfering with it. The resulting non-functional protein complexes are also often targeted for degradation, making this option the most complete description.\n    *   C) is less precise. While aggregation can cause a loss of function, the defining feature here is the interference with the wild-type partner, which is better described by B.\n    *   D) is incorrect because a wild-type phenotype would imply the mutation is recessive, but it's described as dominant-negative.\n\nThe logic holds, and the answer is correct."
