    Checks the correctness of the answer to the transcription factor mutation question.

    The function models the biological principles described in the question:
    1. The protein is a dimer.
    2. The mutation (Y) is in the dimerization domain.
    3. The mutation is heterozygous.
    4. The mutation acts as a dominant-negative.

    It then evaluates the given options against these principles.

    # --- Logical Deduction ---
    # 1. Analyze the term "dominant-negative".
    # By definition, a dominant-negative mutation in a heterozygote results in a mutant protein
    # that interferes with and inactivates the function of the wild-type protein from the other allele.
    # This leads to a loss-of-function phenotype even when a wild-type allele is present.
    
    # 2. Evaluate options based on the "dominant-negative" definition.
    
    # Check Option A:
    if options["A"]["phenotype"] == "gain-of-function":
        if mutation_genetics != "gain-of-function":
            # This contradicts the "dominant-negative" (a type of loss-of-function) premise.
            pass # Option A is incorrect.
        else:
            return "Logic error: Option A should be ruled out."

    # Check Option D:
    if options["D"]["phenotype"] == "wild-type":
        # A dominant mutation, by definition, produces a non-wild-type phenotype in a heterozygote.
        # A wild-type phenotype would imply the mutation is recessive.
        pass # Option D is incorrect.
    else:
        return "Logic error: Option D should be ruled out."

    # 3. Differentiate between B and C, the remaining loss-of-function options.
    # The mutation is in the dimerization domain of a dimeric protein.
    # The most direct mechanism for a dominant-negative effect is the formation of
    # non-functional heterodimers (WildType-Mutant), which "poisons" the pool of
    # functional WildType-WildType dimers.
    
    # Option B's core statement is "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele". This is the
    # precise definition of a dominant-negative effect. The "protein degradation" part is a
    # possible, but not essential, consequence. The key is the inactivation of the WT allele's product.
    
    # Option C suggests "protein aggregation". While aggregation can cause a dominant loss-of-function,
    # it is a more general mechanism. "Dominant-negative" specifically implies interference,
    # making Option B's description of the genetic outcome more accurate and fundamental.

            f"3. Between B and C, Option B ('loss-of-function of the wild-type allele') is the most precise and fundamental description of a dominant-negative effect.\n"
            f"4. Option C ('protein aggregation') describes a possible physical mechanism for loss-of-function, but it is less specific than the genetic definition provided in Option B, which is the hallmark of a dominant-negative mutation."
