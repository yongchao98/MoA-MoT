    "Here is the step-by-step solution using Test-Driven Development.\n\n### 1. Tests\nHere are the small, explicit tests the solution must satisfy, corresponding to each step of the reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Test 1: Hydrogenation.**\n    *   **Input:** (R)-(+)-Limonene\n    *   **Reaction:** H2, Pd/C (1 equivalent)\n    *   **Expected Outcome (Product 1):** The less substituted exocyclic double bond is reduced to an isopropyl group, while the more substituted endocyclic double bond remains. The stereochemistry at C4 is preserved. The product is (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\n2.  **Test 2: Epoxidation.**\n    *   **Input:** Product 1\n    *   **Reaction:** m-CPBA\n    *   **Expected Outcome (Product 2):** The endocyclic double bond is epoxidized. The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the epoxidation to the opposite (anti) face of the ring. This results in a specific stereoisomer of the epoxide: (1S, 2R, 4R)-1,2-epoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Test 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening.**\n    *   **Input:** Product 2\n    *   **Reaction:** Sodium methoxide (NaOMe)\n    *   **Expected Outcome (Product 3):** Under basic conditions, the methoxide nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide (C2) via an S_N2 mechanism. This results in inversion of the stereocenter at C2 and opening of the ring to form a trans-diaxial product, (1S, 2R, 4R)-2-methoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n4.  **Test 4: Esterification.**\n    *   **Input:** Product 3\n    *   **Reaction:** Propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP\n    *   **Expected Outcome (Product 4):** The tertiary alcohol at C1 is converted to a propionate ester. This reaction (Steglich esterification) proceeds with retention of configuration at all stereocenters. The final product is (1S, 2R, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.\n\n### 2.
