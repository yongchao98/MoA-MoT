    # A dictionary represents the molecule's key features at each step.
    # 'stereocenters': Maps carbon number to its R/S configuration.
    # 'features': A list of other relevant structural features.

    # --- Step 0: Starting Material: (R)-(+)-Limonene ---
    # IUPAC: (R)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene
    # Key features:
    # - Stereocenter at C4 is (R).
    # - For the (R) configuration, the bulky isopropenyl group is on a wedge.
    # - Two double bonds: one endocyclic (trisubstituted) and one exocyclic (disubstituted).

    }

    # --- Step 1: Hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) -> Product 1 ---
    # Reaction: Catalytic hydrogenation reduces the less sterically hindered double bond.
    # The exocyclic double bond is less substituted and more accessible.
    # Result: Isopropenyl group becomes an Isopropyl group. Stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.

    # --- Step 2: Epoxidation (m-CPBA) -> Product 2 ---
    # Reaction: Epoxidation of the remaining endocyclic double bond.
    # Stereoselectivity: The reagent attacks from the face anti to the bulky C4 isopropyl group.
    # Since the isopropyl group is on a wedge, the epoxide oxygen will be on a dash.
    # This creates new stereocenters at C1 and C2.
    # - C4 remains (R).
    # - C1 configuration: Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > CH3. With O on a dash and CH3 on a wedge, the configuration is (S).
    # - C2 configuration: Priorities are O > C1 > C3 > H. With O on a dash and H on a wedge, the configuration is (R).
    # The resulting epoxide is (1S, 2R, 4R).

    # The answer's description for step 2 is correct.

    # --- Step 3: Epoxide Opening (NaOMe) -> Product 3 ---
    # Reaction: S_N2 ring-opening of the epoxide.
    # Regioselectivity: Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (MeO-) attacks the less hindered carbon (C2, which is secondary) over the more hindered one (C1, which is tertiary).
    # Stereoselectivity: S_N2 attack proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C2).
    # C2 was (R), so it becomes (S). C1 and C4 are unchanged.

    # The resulting alcohol is (1S, 2S, 4R). The answer's description for step 3 is correct.

    # --- Step 4: Esterification (Steglich) -> Product 4 ---
    # Reaction: The alcohol at C1 is converted to a propionate ester.
    # Stereoselectivity: The reaction occurs at the alcohol's oxygen, not the chiral carbon. The C1-O bond is not broken.
    # Configuration is retained at all stereocenters.

    # --- Final Verification ---
    # The derived final stereochemistry is C1=S, C2=S, C4=R.
    
    # The provided answer is D. Let's check its name:
    # (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate
    
    # The name specifies the stereochemistry as (1S, 2S, 4R).
    # This perfectly matches our derived stereochemistry.
    
    # Let's quickly check the other options:
    # A) (1S,2S,5R)... -> Incorrect numbering.
    # B) ...cyclohex-3-en-1-yl... -> Incorrect structure (still has a double bond).
    # C) (1S,2R,4R)... -> Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (implies no inversion).

    # The reasoning in the provided answer is sound, and the final choice of D is consistent with a correct mechanistic analysis.
    return "Correct"
