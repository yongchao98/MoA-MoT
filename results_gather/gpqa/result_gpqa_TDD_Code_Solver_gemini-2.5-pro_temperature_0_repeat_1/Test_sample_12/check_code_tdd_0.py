    # --- Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence ---

    # Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-Limonene
    # Reaction: H2, Pd/C (1 equivalent) on (R)-Limonene.
    # Principle: Catalytic hydrogenation preferentially reduces the less sterically hindered/substituted double bond.
    # In Limonene, the exocyclic C=CH2 is less substituted than the endocyclic C=C(CH3).
    # Outcome: The exocyclic double bond is reduced. The stereocenter at C4 is unaffected.
    # Product 1 has (R) stereochemistry at C4.
    # LLM's analysis for this step is correct.
    product_1_stereocenters = {'C4': 'R'}

    # Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1
    # Reaction: m-CPBA on (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.
    # Principle: Epoxidation occurs on the face of the double bond that is anti (opposite) to the bulky substituent.
    # The bulky isopropyl group at C4(R) directs the m-CPBA to the opposite face.
    # Outcome: This stereoselective attack results in an epoxide with (1S, 2R, 4R) configuration.
    # LLM's analysis for this step is correct.
    product_2_stereocenters = {'C1': 'S', 'C2': 'R', 'C4': 'R'}

    # Step 3: Epoxide Ring-Opening
    # Reaction: Sodium methoxide (NaOMe) on the (1S, 2R, 4R)-epoxide.
    # Principle: Under basic/nucleophilic conditions (S_N2), the nucleophile (MeO-) attacks the less
    # sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 is tertiary, C2 is secondary, so attack occurs at C2.
    # A key principle of the S_N2 mechanism is the inversion of configuration at the attacked stereocenter.
    # Outcome: The methoxide attacks C2, inverting its configuration from (R) to (S). The stereocenters at C1 and C4 are not inverted.
    # The correct stereochemistry for Product 3 should be (1S, 2S, 4R).
    
    # Let's calculate the correct stereochemistry for Product 3
    correct_product_3_stereocenters = product_2_stereocenters.copy()
    # Invert C2 from 'R' to 'S'
    correct_product_3_stereocenters['C2'] = 'S'

    # Step 4: Esterification
    # Reaction: Steglich esterification (Propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP).
    # Principle: This reaction converts an alcohol to an ester with retention of configuration at the alcohol's carbon.
    # The C-O bond of the alcohol is not broken.
    # Outcome: The stereochemistry of Product 4 is the same as Product 3.
