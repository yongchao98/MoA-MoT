    "Here are the tests for the problem:\n1.  **Vacuum Case**: If the medium is a vacuum, its index of refraction `n` is 1. The speed of light should be `c=1` regardless of the velocity `v` of the (non-existent) medium. For `n=1.0` and `v=0.5`, the result should be `1.0`.\n2.  **Stationary Medium Case**: If the glass is not moving, `v=0`. The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is simply the speed of light in a stationary medium, which is `c/n`. With `c=1`, this is `1/n`. For `n=1.5` and `v=0`, the result should be `1/1.5`.\n3.  **Typical Case**: For a glass with `n=1.5` moving at `v=0.5` (half the speed of light), the relativistic velocity addition formula `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v)` where `u' = 1/n` gives `u = (1/1.5 + 0.5) / (1 + (1/1.5)*0.5) = 0.875`.\n4.  **Another Typical Case**: For a medium with `n=2.0` moving at `v=0.1`, the result should be `(1 + 2.0*0.1) / (2.0 + 0.1) = 1.2 / 2.1`, which is approximately `0.571428`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_light_speed(n, v):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the speed of light in a moving medium relative to a stationary observer.\n    This is an application of the relativistic velocity-addition formula.\n\n    The speed of light in the medium's rest frame is u' = c/n.
