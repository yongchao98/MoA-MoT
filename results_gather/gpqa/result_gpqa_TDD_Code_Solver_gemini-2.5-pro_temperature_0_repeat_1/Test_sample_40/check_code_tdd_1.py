    # The question requires selecting an option from A, B, C, or D.
    # The provided text is a conversational statement, not a valid choice.
    # Therefore, the answer is incorrect because it fails to answer the question.

    # Let's derive the correct answer to explain why.
    # We use the Einstein velocity-addition formula:
    # u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)
    # where:
    # c = speed of light in vacuum (given as 1)
    # u' = speed of light in the moving frame (the glass)
    # v = speed of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the observer
    # u = speed of light as seen by the observer in the laboratory

    # Define symbolic variables for a robust algebraic check
    n, v = sympy.symbols('n v', real=True, positive=True)
    c = 1

    # The speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is u' = c/n
    u_prime = c / n

    # The speed of the glass relative to the lab is v.
    # Applying the velocity-addition formula:
    correct_formula = (u_prime + v) / (1 + u_prime * v / c**2)

    # Simplify the expression
    # correct_formula becomes ((1/n) + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)
    # Multiplying numerator and denominator by n gives:
    # (1 + n*v) / (n + v)
    simplified_correct_formula = sympy.simplify(correct_formula)

        "A": 1,
        "B": (1 + n*v) / (n + v),
        "C": (1 + n*v) / (n - v),
        "D": (1 - n*v) / (n + v)
