def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer for the interplanar distance
    of a rhombohedral crystal.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the parameters from the question: lattice constant 'a', angle 'alpha', and Miller indices (h,k,l).
    2. Defines the value of the answer to be checked (Option B: 9.54 Angstrom).
    3. Calculates the theoretical interplanar distance using the specific formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system.
    4. Compares the calculated value with the provided answer, allowing for rounding tolerance.
    5. Returns "Correct" if they match, or a reason for the discrepancy if they do not.
