    # 1. From "AGG -> 115":  A + 2*G = 115
    # 2. From "TGCTGA -> 176": A + C + 2*G + 2*T = 176
    #
    # Substituting (1) into (2) gives: 115 + C + 2*T = 176  =>  C + 2*T = 61
    #
    # We can express A and C in terms of G and T:
    # A = 115 - 2*G
    # C = 61 - 2*T
    #
    # The target sequence is "ACAGTGACC".
    # Base counts: A=3, C=3, G=2, T=1
    # Target Value = 3*A + 3*C + 2*G + T
    #
    # Substitute the expressions for A and C into the target value equation:
    # Value = 3*(115 - 2*G) + 3*(61 - 2*T) + 2*G + T
