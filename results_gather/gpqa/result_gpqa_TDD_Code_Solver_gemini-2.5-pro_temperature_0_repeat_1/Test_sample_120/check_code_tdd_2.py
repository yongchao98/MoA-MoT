    # Rule 1: Organocuprates (Gilman reagents) attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.
    # C1 is tertiary (connected to C2, C5, O, and a methyl group).
    # C6 is secondary (connected to C2, C5, O, and a hydrogen).
    # Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon.
    
    # This regioselectivity determines the product's substitution pattern.
    # Attack at C6 means the new methyl group is at C6, and the alcohol is at C1.
    # The original methyls are at C1, C3, C4.
    # The product is a cyclohexanol. For IUPAC naming, the -OH carbon is C1.
    # Renumbering: old C1 -> new C1. The next substituent is at old C6. So, old C6 -> new C2.
    # The resulting substitution pattern is methyls at 1, 2, 4, 5.
