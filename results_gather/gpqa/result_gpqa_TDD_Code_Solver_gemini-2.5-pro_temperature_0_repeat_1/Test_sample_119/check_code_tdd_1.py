def check_parallax_distribution_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the statement that the number of stars
    per unit parallax (plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4, assuming a uniform
    distribution of stars in space.

    The method is as follows:
    1.  Simulate a large number of stars uniformly distributed in a 3D spherical shell.
        A uniform volume distribution is achieved using inverse transform sampling.
    2.  Calculate the parallax for each star (plx = 1/distance).
    3.  Create a histogram of the resulting parallax values. The counts in each bin
        represent the number of stars in a given parallax range (dN).
    4.  The theoretical relationship dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁴ implies that a plot of
        log(counts) vs. log(plx) should be a straight line with a slope of -4.
    5.  Perform a linear regression on the log-log data of the histogram.
    6.  Compare the fitted slope to the expected value of -4. If it's within a
        small tolerance, the answer is considered correct.
