    # --- Calculation Steps ---

    # 1. The state is pure, so S(rho) = 0. The non-Gaussianity (nG) is the
    #    entropy of the reference Gaussian state, S(tau).

    # 2. Calculate the squared normalization constant N^2
    exp_term = np.exp(-2 * alpha**2)
    n_squared = 1 + np.sin(2 * phi) * exp_term

    # 3. Calculate the first and second moments of the state rho.
    #    The reference state tau has the same moments.
    #    <a> = beta
    #    <n> = <a_dagger a> = n_rho
    #    <a^2> = a2_rho
    beta = (alpha / n_squared) * np.cos(2 * phi)
    n_rho = (alpha**2 / n_squared) * (1 - np.sin(2 * phi) * exp_term)
    a2_rho = (alpha**2 / n_squared) * (1 + np.sin(2 * phi) * exp_term)

    # 4. Calculate the centered moments for the reference state tau.
    n_centered = n_rho - np.abs(beta)**2
    a2_centered = a2_rho - beta**2

    # 5. Calculate the determinant of the covariance matrix of tau.
    det_v = (n_centered + 0.5)**2 - np.abs(a2_centered)**2

    # 6. Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue (nu) and the thermal photon number (x).
    nu = np.sqrt(det_v)
    x = nu - 0.5

    # 7. Calculate the entropy S(tau) = g(x) = (x+1)ln(x+1) - x*ln(x).
    #    This is the final non-Gaussianity value.

    else:
        # Use natural logarithm (ln)
        calculated_nG = (x + 1) * np.log(x + 1) - x * np.log(x)

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated value is close to the proposed answer.
    # A tolerance of 0.01 is appropriate since the answer is given to two decimal places.
