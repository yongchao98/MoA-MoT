def check_density_matrix_position():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer for the geometrical position of a density matrix.

    The question asks for the geometrical position (Bloch vector) of the density matrix:
    rho = 1/2 * (|0><0| + |1><1|)

    The provided answer is D, which corresponds to the vector r=(0,0,0).

    The function will:
    1. Construct the density matrix rho in its matrix form.
    2. Define the Pauli matrices (sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z).
    3. Calculate the components of the Bloch vector (rx, ry, rz) using the formula r_i = Tr(rho * sigma_i).
    4. Compare the calculated vector with the vector corresponding to the given answer 'D'.
