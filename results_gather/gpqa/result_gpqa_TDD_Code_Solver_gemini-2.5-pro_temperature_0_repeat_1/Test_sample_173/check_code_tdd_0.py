    # --- Independent Calculation ---

    # 1. Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments (E_m1 and E_m2)
    # E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * M_rest_energy_GeV
    # E_m1 = 2 * E_m2
    total_fragment_rest_energy_GeV = final_mass_fraction * M_rest_energy_GeV
    # Substitute: 2*E_m2 + E_m2 = total_fragment_rest_energy_GeV
    # 3 * E_m2 = total_fragment_rest_energy_GeV
    E_m2_GeV = total_fragment_rest_energy_GeV / (mass_ratio_m1_to_m2 + 1.0)
    E_m1_GeV = mass_ratio_m1_to_m2 * E_m2_GeV

    # 2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)
    # Q = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy
    Q_GeV = M_rest_energy_GeV - total_fragment_rest_energy_GeV

    # 3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation
    # From conservation of momentum (p1=p2), classical T = p^2/(2m), so T1/T2 = m2/m1.
    # T1_c + T2_c = Q  =>  T1_c + (m1/m2)*T1_c = Q  => T1_c * (1 + m1/m2) = Q
    T1_classical_GeV = Q_GeV / (1.0 + mass_ratio_m1_to_m2)

    # 4. Calculate T1 using the correct relativistic formula
    # From conservation of momentum (p1=p2), and (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2), we have:
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*E_m1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E_m2
    # With T2 = Q - T1, we can solve for T1:
    # T1 = (Q^2 + 2*Q*E_m2) / (2 * (E_m1 + E_m2 + Q))
    numerator = Q_GeV * (Q_GeV + 2 * E_m2_GeV)
    denominator = 2 * (E_m1_GeV + E_m2_GeV + Q_GeV)
    T1_relativistic_GeV = numerator / denominator

    # 5. Calculate the difference and convert to MeV
    difference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV
