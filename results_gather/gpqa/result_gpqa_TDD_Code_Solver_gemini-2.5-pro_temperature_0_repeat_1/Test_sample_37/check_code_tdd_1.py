    """
    This function verifies the correctness of the answer to the given organic chemistry question.

    It simulates the reaction based on established chemical principles:
    1.  The starting ketone is identified as pentan-2-one from the iminium salt name.
    2.  The base LDA is known to form the kinetic enolate by deprotonating the less-substituted alpha-carbon.
    3.  The enolate is alkylated with an ethyl group from iodoethane.
    4.  The resulting ketone's IUPAC name is determined.
    5.  This calculated product and the reagent sequence logic are compared against the provided answer (Option D).
