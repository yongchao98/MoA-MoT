    "Here are the tests and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Test Cases:**\n    *   **Test 1 (Problem Statement):**\n        *   Inputs: Initial acetic acid concentration = 0.05 M, initial volume = 20.00 cm³, dilution water volume = 20.00 cm³, NaOH concentration = 0.1 M, Ka = 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n        *   Expected pH at 25% titration: ~4.26. This is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). At 25% titration, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75. pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73. So, pH ≈ 4.73 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.26.\n        *   Expected pH at equivalence point: ~8.52. At this point, all acid is converted to its conjugate base. We calculate the concentration of the conjugate base, find Kb from Ka (Kb = Kw/Ka), and then find the pOH from the hydrolysis of the base, finally converting to pH.\n    *   **Test 2 (No Dilution):**\n        *   Inputs: Initial acetic acid concentration = 0.1 M, initial volume = 50.0 cm³, dilution water volume = 0 cm³, NaOH concentration = 0.1 M, Ka = 1.75x10⁻⁵.\n        *   Expected pH at 25% titration: ~4.27. (pKa = -log(1.75e-5) ≈ 4.76. pH = 4.76 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.28, rounding might differ slightly based on intermediate steps). Let's calculate more precisely: 4.757 + (-0.477) = 4.28.\n        *   Expected pH at equivalence point: ~8.87. Moles acid = 0.05 * 0.1 = 0.005. Vol NaOH = 0.005/0.1 = 0.05L. Total vol = 0.1L. [A⁻] = 0.005/0.1 = 0.05M. Kb = 1e-14/1.75e-5 ≈ 5.71e-10. [OH⁻] = sqrt(5.71e-10 * 0.05) ≈ 5.34e-6. pOH ≈ 5.27. pH ≈ 14 - 5.27 = 8.73.
