    Checks the correctness of the answer for the textile dye color problem.

    The core logic is:
    1. Calculate the wavelength of the *emitted* light from the given energy.
    2. Determine the color of this emitted light.
    3. The *absorbed* color is the complementary color to the emitted color.
    4. Compare this calculated absorbed color with the provided answer.
