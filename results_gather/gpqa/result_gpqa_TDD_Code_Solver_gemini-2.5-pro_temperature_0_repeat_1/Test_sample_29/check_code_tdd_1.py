    Checks the correctness of the answer to the textile dye color question.

    The question is:
    A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. 
    What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?
    A) Red
    B) Blue
    C) Yellow
    D) Violet

    The provided answer from the other LLM is a meta-commentary ("Excellent! The TDD process...") 
    and does not contain an actual choice (A, B, C, or D). 
    Therefore, this code solves the problem from first principles and determines the correct answer.
    It can then be used to validate any given choice.
