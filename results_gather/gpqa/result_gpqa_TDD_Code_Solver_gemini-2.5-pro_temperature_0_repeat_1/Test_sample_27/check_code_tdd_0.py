    # (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. The key is the (S) configuration at C4.

    # which will direct subsequent reactions.
    c4_config_initial = 'S'
    c4_directing_group_orientation = 'down'

    # --- Step 1: Protection ---
    # The -OH is protected as a bulky -OTBS group. This reaction does not change the
    # stereocenter. The bulky directing group at C4 remains 'down'.
    # The logic in the provided answer is correct for this step.

    # --- Step 2: Conjugate Addition (Ph2CuLi) and Trapping (BnBr) ---
    # Part A: Phenyl (Ph) addition to C3. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.
    # Stereocontrol: The Ph group adds 'anti' (opposite) to the bulky C4-OTBS group.
    # Since C4-OTBS is 'down', the Ph group adds 'up'.
    c3_phenyl_orientation = 'up'
    
    # Part B: Benzyl (Bn) addition to C2. The intermediate enolate is trapped.

    c2_config_derived = 'S'

    # --- Step 3: Second Alkylation (LDA, CH3I) ---
    # Part A: Regiochemistry. LDA is a bulky base, forming the kinetic enolate at the
    # less substituted alpha-carbon, C6. This is correct.
    
    # Part B: Stereochemistry. The approach of CH3I is directed by existing groups.
    # The C2-Bn group ('down') and C4-OTBS group ('down') sterically block the bottom face.
    # Therefore, the methyl group adds from the 'up' face.
    c6_methyl_orientation = 'up'
    
    # Determine resulting stereochemistry for C6.
    # C6: CH3('up'), H('down'). Priorities: C1 > C5 > CH3. Path is Counter-Clockwise (CCW). H is 'down' -> (S).
    c6_config_derived = 'S'

    # --- Step 4: Deprotection (aq. HCl) ---
    # The -OTBS group is converted back to -OH. Stereocenters are unaffected.
    # The C4 configuration remains (S) throughout.
