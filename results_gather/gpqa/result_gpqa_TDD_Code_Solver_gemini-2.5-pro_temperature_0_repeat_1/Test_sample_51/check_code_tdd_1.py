    This function verifies the answer to the astronomy problem by recalculating the result.
    
    The problem asks for the factor by which the population ratio (N2/N1) of two energy levels changes.
    This factor is Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots.

    The population ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation:
    N2 / N1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))

    The factor is:
    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))
           = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) )
    
    The energy difference ΔE is related to the transition wavelength λ by ΔE = hc/λ.
