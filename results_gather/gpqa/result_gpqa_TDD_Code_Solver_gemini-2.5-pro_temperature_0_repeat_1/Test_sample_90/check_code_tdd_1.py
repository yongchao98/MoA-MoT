    ### 1. Tests

    1.  **Test Diels-Alder Reaction**: The [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,3-butadiene and maleic anhydride should form a cyclohexene ring. The stereochemistry of the dienophile (maleic anhydride has *cis* carbonyls) must be retained, resulting in a *cis*-fused product (*cis*-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride).
    2.  **Test Anhydride Hydrolysis**: The hydrolysis of a cyclic anhydride with NaOH followed by acid should open the ring to form two carboxylic acid groups.
    3.  **Test Stereochemistry Retention**: The hydrolysis step does not affect the stereocenters of the cyclohexene ring. Therefore, the *cis* relationship of the substituents must be preserved, converting the *cis*-anhydride into a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid.
    4.  **Test Full Synthesis**: The entire two-step sequence should correctly transform the starting materials into the final product, which is *cis*-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid.
    5.  **Test Incorrect Isomer**: The final product should not be the *trans*-dicarboxylic acid, which would arise from a different starting material (e.g., using fumaric acid instead of maleic anhydride).
