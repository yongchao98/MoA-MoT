  "question": "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\n\nA) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\nB) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\nC) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\nD) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is the solution developed using a Test-Driven Development approach.\n\n### 1. Tests\n1.  **Test_No_Cre:** In the absence of Cre recombinase, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remains. The stop codon will terminate translation of the receptor before the eGFP sequence is reached. Expected: No eGFP signal.\n2.  **Test_Cre_Recombination_Frameshift:** In the presence of SOX10-Cre, the stop cassette is excised, but a single 34 bp lox2272 site remains between the receptor ORF and the eGFP ORF. Since 34 is not divisible by 3, this introduces a frameshift mutation. The eGFP sequence will be translated out of frame, producing a non-functional, non-fluorescent polypeptide. Expected: No eGFP signal.\n3.  **Test_Hypothetical_In_Frame_Recombination:** If the recombination event left an \"in-frame\" scar (e.g., 33 bp), the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein would be translated correctly. Expected: Green eGFP signal.\n4.  **Test_Hypothetical_Golgi_Retention:** If the Receptor-eGFP protein were correctly translated but misfolded and stuck in the Golgi, a green signal would still be observed, just localized to the Golgi apparatus rather than the cell membrane. This contradicts the observation of *no* green signal. Expected: Green eGFP signal (mislocalized).\n\n### 2.
