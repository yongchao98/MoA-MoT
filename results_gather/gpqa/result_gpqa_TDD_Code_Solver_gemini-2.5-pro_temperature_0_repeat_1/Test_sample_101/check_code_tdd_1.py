    """
    Checks the correctness of an LLM's answer to the given molecular biology question.

    The function works by:
    1.  Modeling the key facts from the experimental setup described in the question.
    2.  Simulating the molecular consequences of Cre-Lox recombination, specifically checking for frameshift mutations.
    3.  Evaluating each multiple-choice option against the modeled outcome.
    4.  Comparing the LLM's provided answer choice with the logically derived correct answer.

    # Step 1: Define the biological and molecular facts from the question.
    # The key element for the eGFP signal is the receptor cassette.
    # Construct: ... IRES -> Receptor_ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP
    # In the presence of Cre recombinase, the sequence between the two lox2272 sites is excised.
    # This leaves a single lox2272 site behind as a "scar".
    # A standard lox site (including loxP and lox2272) is 34 base pairs long.
    lox_site_scar_length = 34

    # Step 2: Analyze the molecular consequences of the experimental design.
    # For the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein to be translated correctly, the number of base pairs
    # in the scar must be a multiple of 3 to maintain the reading frame.
    is_in_frame = (lox_site_scar_length % 3) == 0

    # Step 3: Evaluate each possible answer choice based on the analysis.
