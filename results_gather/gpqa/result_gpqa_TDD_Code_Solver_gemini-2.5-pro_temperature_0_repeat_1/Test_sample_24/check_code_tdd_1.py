    # --- Chemical Analysis ---

    # Analysis of Reaction 1: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one
    # The transformation of a fused ring system into a spiro ketone catalyzed by strong acid (H2SO4)
    # is characteristic of a pinacol rearrangement. This reaction requires a 1,2-diol (a vicinal diol)
    # as the starting material.
    # - '2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol' is a 1,2-diol and a plausible precursor.
    # - '2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol' is an alcohol. Treatment with H2SO4 would typically lead to
    #   dehydration (elimination) to form an alkene, not a ketone rearrangement.
    # Therefore, reactant A must be '2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol'.

    # Analysis of Reaction 2: B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol
    # The reagent BuLi (butyllithium) is a very strong base and a source of the nucleophilic butyl anion (Bu-).
    # The product is an alcohol that does NOT contain a butyl group.
    # Let's check the proposed reactants for B:
    # - If B is '4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one' (a ketone): The reaction with BuLi would be a
    #   nucleophilic addition of the butyl group to the carbonyl carbon. The resulting product would be
    #   5-butyl-4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol, which is NOT the product specified in the question.
    # - If B is '(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene' (an ether): BuLi acts as a strong base,
    #   deprotonating the carbon alpha to both the phenyl group and the ether oxygen. This initiates a
    #   [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement, which correctly yields the target product '4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol'
    #   after protonation (H+ workup).
    # Therefore, reactant B must be '(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene'.
