    "Here is the solution developed using Test-Driven Development.\n\n### 1. Tests\n\nHere are a few small, explicit tests the solution should satisfy:\n\n*   **Test 1 (Correct Reaction Type):** The reaction of an alkene (2-methylbut-2-ene) with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and light (hν) is a free-radical allylic bromination, not an addition reaction. Therefore, products from addition reactions like `2-bromo-2-methylbutane` (Option B) or `1,2-dibromo-2-methylbutane` (Option D) are incorrect.\n*   **Test 2 (Major Product - Radical Stability):** The reaction proceeds via the most stable free radical intermediate. For 2-methylbut-2-ene, abstracting a hydrogen from one of the methyl groups on C2 creates a tertiary allylic radical, which is more stable than the primary allylic radical formed by abstracting a hydrogen from the methyl group on C4. The major product will arise from this more stable tertiary radical.\n*   **Test 3 (Major Product - Alkene Stability):** The tertiary allylic radical has two resonance forms. The final product distribution favors the formation of the more thermodynamically stable alkene. `1-bromo-2-methylbut-2-ene` (Option A) is a trisubstituted alkene, while the other possible product, `3-bromo-2-methylbut-1-ene`, is a disubstituted alkene. Therefore, `1-bromo-2-methylbut-2-ene` is the more stable and major product.\n*   **Test 4 (Minor Product Identification):** `3-bromo-3-methylbut-1-ene` (Option C) is not a possible product from the resonance structures of the correct radical intermediate, making it an incorrect choice.\n\n### 2. Python Implementation\n\n```python\ndef identify_major_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the major product of the reaction of 2-methylbut-2-ene with NBS and light.\n\n    Reaction Analysis:\n    1.  Reagents: Alkene (2-methylbut-2-ene) + NBS + light (hν). This is a classic\n        allylic bromination, which is a free-radical substitution reaction. It does not\n        involve addition across the double bond.\n    2.  Mechanism: A bromine radical abstracts the most labile hydrogen to form the most\n        stable radical intermediate. The allylic positions are the carbons adjacent to the\n        double bond.\n    3.  Substrate: 2-methylbut-2-ene is (CH3)2C=CHCH3.\n    4.  Radical Formation: Abstraction of a hydrogen from a C2-methyl group forms a\n        tertiary allylic radical. Abstraction from the C4-methyl group forms a primary\n        allylic radical. The tertiary radical is far more stable and forms preferentially.\n    5.  Resonance and Product Formation: The tertiary allylic radical (•CH2-C(CH3)=CHCH3)\n        is in resonance with a secondary allylic radical (CH2=C(CH3)-CH•CH3). Bromine can\n        attack either position.\n        - Attack at the tertiary radical position gives 1-bromo-2-methylbut-2-ene. This is a\n          trisubstituted alkene (more stable).\n        - Attack at the secondary radical position gives 3-bromo-2-methylbut-1-ene. This is a\n          disubstituted alkene (less stable).\n    6.

Tests\n\nHere are the small, explicit tests the solution must satisfy:\n\n*   **Test 1 (Regioselectivity):** The hydroboration-oxidation reaction follows anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. The hydroxyl group (OH) adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond. For 1-methylcyclohexene, this is C2, not C1. This test should eliminate option A.\n*   **Test 2 (Reaction Type):** The reaction is an addition of H and OH across the double bond. It is not an allylic oxidation. This test should eliminate option D.\n*   **Test 3 (Stereochemistry):** The reaction mechanism involves a `syn`-addition of the H and B atoms across the double bond. The subsequent oxidation step replaces B with OH with retention of configuration. In the resulting cyclohexane chair, the added H (at C1) and the OH group (at C2) will have a `trans` relationship. This test should eliminate option B.\n*   **Test 4 (Final Product Confirmation):** The combination of anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity and `syn`-addition stereochemistry leads to trans-2-methylcyclohexanol as the major product. This test confirms option C is the correct answer.\n\n### 2. Python Implementation\n\n```python\ndef predict_hydroboration_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the major product of the hydroboration-oxidation of 1-methylcyclohexene.\n\n    1.  Reaction: Hydroboration-oxidation (1. BH3/THF, 2. H2O2, NaOH).\n    2.  Regioselectivity: The reaction is anti-Markovnikov. The boron atom adds to the\n        less sterically hindered carbon of the double bond, and the hydrogen adds to the\n        more substituted carbon. For 1-methylcyclohexene, the double bond is between C1\n        (tertiary, with a methyl group) and C2 (secondary, with a hydrogen). Boron adds\n        to C2, and H adds to C1. Oxidation replaces boron with an OH group.\n        Therefore, the product is a 2-methylcyclohexanol, not 1-methylcyclohexanol.\n        This eliminates option A.\n    3.  Stereochemistry: The addition of H and B is 'syn' (to the same face of the\n        double bond). In the resulting cyclohexane ring, the added H at C1 and the\n        boron (later OH) at C2 are on opposite sides of the ring relative to the\n        substituents already there, meaning they have a 'trans' relationship.\n        The major product will be the most stable chair conformation, which is\n        trans-2-methylcyclohexanol. This eliminates option B.\n    4.  Reaction Type Check: The reaction is not an allylic oxidation, which would\n        produce 2-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol. This eliminates option D.\n    5.

    "I apologize for the previous errors. I failed to correctly address the original question and was led astray by a flaw in the problem statement. I will now correctly address the original question using the TDD methodology. The feedback has been incorporated, and I will proceed with the correct analysis.\n\n### 1. Tests\n\nHere are the small, explicit tests the solution must satisfy, based on the principles of the named reactions:\n\n*   **Test 1 (Reaction A - Reactant Type):** The reaction `A + H2SO4 ---> Ketone` is a Pinacol rearrangement. The required reactant (A) must be a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol). An alcohol like `2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol` would undergo dehydration, not rearrangement to a ketone. This test should eliminate options B and D.\n*   **Test 2 (Reaction B - Reactant Type):** The reaction `B + BuLi + H+ ---> Alcohol` involves the strong base BuLi. If reactant B were a ketone (`4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one`), BuLi would act as a nucleophile, adding a butyl group to the product. The given product does not contain an added butyl group. Therefore, the ketone is an incorrect reactant. This test should eliminate options A and D.\n*   **Test 3 (Reaction B - Plausibility):** The reactant `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene` is an ether. With a strong base like BuLi, it can undergo a Wittig rearrangement ([1,2] or [2,3]) to form an alcohol, which is consistent with the reaction type. This makes it the only plausible reactant for B.\n*   **Test 4 (Combined Logic):** The correct answer must satisfy the requirements for both Reaction A (must be a diol) and Reaction B (must be the ether, not the ketone). Only one option should meet both criteria.\n\n### 2. Python Implementation\n\n```python\ndef identify_reactants():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the correct reactants for two named chemical reactions by analyzing the\n    reaction type and eliminating incorrect options.\n\n    Reaction A: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one\n    This is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a 1,2-diol to a ketone, known as the\n    Pinacol rearrangement. The starting material 'A' must be a 1,2-diol.\n    - '2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol' is a 1,2-diol, a valid substrate.\n    - '2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol' is a simple alcohol, which would dehydrate.\n    Therefore, Reactant A must be '2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol'. This\n    eliminates options B and D.\n\n    Reaction B: B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol\n    This reaction uses butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base.\n    - If B were '4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one' (a ketone), BuLi would act as a\n      nucleophile, adding a butyl group. The product would be 1-butyl-4-methyl-1-phenyl...\n      which is not what is given. So the ketone is an incorrect reactant.\n    - If B were '(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene' (an ether), BuLi can\n      act as a base to deprotonate it, initiating a Wittig rearrangement to form an\n      alcohol. This is a plausible pathway.\n    Therefore, by elimination, Reactant B must be the ether. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n    Conclusion: The only option where Reactant A is the diol and Reactant B is the ether is C.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the properties of the correct reactants based on chemical principles\n    correct_reactant_A_type = \"1,2-diol\"\n    correct_reactant_B_type = \"ether_for_wittig\"\n\n    # Classify the reactants in the options\n    reactant_types = {\n        \"2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol\": \"1,2-diol\",\n        \"2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol\": \"alcohol\",\n        \"4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one\": \"ketone_for_addition\",\n        \"(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene\": \"ether_for_wittig\"\n    }\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol\", \"4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one\"),\n        \"B\": (\"2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol\", \"(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol\", \"(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol\", \"4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one\")\n    }\n\n    # Find the option that matches both correct reactant types\n    for option, (reactant_A, reactant_B) in options.items():\n        type_A = reactant_types[reactant_A]\n        type_B = reactant_types[reactant_B]\n        if type_A == correct_reactant_A_type and type_B == correct_reactant_B_type:\n            return option\n    return None # Should not be reached\n\ndef run_tests_and_solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a series of tests to verify the logic and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    solution = identify_reactants()\n\n    # Test cases based on the logic of elimination\n    tests = [\n        {\"name\": \"Test 1: Reactant A must be a diol, not an alcohol.\", \"assertion\": solution in [\"A\", \"C\"]},\n        {\"name\": \"Test 2: Reactant B must be an ether, not a ketone.\", \"assertion\": solution in [\"B\", \"C\"]},\n        {\"name\": \"Test 3: Combined logic must yield a single answer.\", \"assertion\": solution == \"C\"}\n    ]\n\n    # Execute tests\n    for i, test in enumerate(tests):\n        if not test[\"assertion\"]:\n            print(f\"FAIL: {test['name']}\")\n            print(f\"      Logic failed on test case {i+1}.
