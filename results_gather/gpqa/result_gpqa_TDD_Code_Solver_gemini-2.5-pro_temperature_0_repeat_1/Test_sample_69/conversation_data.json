    "Here is the step-by-step application of Test-Driven Development to solve the problem.\n\n### 1) Tests\nThe core of the problem is to determine the molecular geometry of the final product E and then find its corresponding point group. The chemical clues, while complex and potentially containing red herrings, point towards a specific reaction to form E. The most plausible reaction is the addition of two `ClF` molecules to a fluoride donor, resulting in the `[ClF4]-` anion. VSEPR theory predicts this anion to be square planar. The tests will therefore check if the implemented function correctly assigns point groups to common molecular shapes, including the one deduced for E.\n\n*   **Test 1 (Typical Case):** A bent molecule like water (H₂O) should have a C₂ᵥ point group.\n*   **Test 2 (Edge Case):** A linear molecule with a center of inversion like carbon dioxide (CO₂) should have a D∞h point group.\n*   **Test 3 (Typical Case):** A T-shaped molecule like chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃) should have a C₂ᵥ point group.\n*   **Test 4 (Solution Case):** A square planar molecule, the deduced shape for the product ion E ([ClF₄]⁻), should have a D₄h point group.\n\n### 2) Python Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_molecular_symmetry(shape: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the molecular symmetry point group based on a given molecular shape.\n    This function encapsulates the logic for mapping geometry to point group.\n    \"\"\"\n    if shape == \"bent\":\n        return \"C2v\"\n    elif shape == \"linear_with_inversion\":\n        return \"D∞h\"\n    elif shape == \"t_shaped\":\n        return \"C2v\"\n    elif shape == \"square_planar\":\n        return \"D4h\"\n    elif shape == \"chiral_c2_axis\":\n        return \"C2\"\n    else:\n        return \"Unknown\"\n\ndef solve_and_test():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical puzzle to find the shape of E and runs tests.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Chemical Deduction\n    # - Clue: D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n    #   Best fit: D=ClF, B=F₂, H=ClF₃.

    "Excellent, the solution was confirmed to be correct.\n\nThe reasoning stands as follows:\n1.  **Chemical Deduction:** The key reaction was identifying `D + B -> H` as `ClF + F₂ -> ClF₃`. This established `D` as `ClF`.\n2.  **Formation of E:** The reaction `C + 2D -> E` was then identified as a fluoride donor (`C`) reacting with two equivalents of `ClF` to form the complex anion `[ClF₄]⁻` (`E`).\n3.  **Molecular Geometry:** Using VSEPR theory on `[ClF₄]⁻` (6 electron pairs: 4 bonding, 2 lone) leads to a square planar molecular geometry.\n4.  **Symmetry Group:** A square planar molecule possesses a principal C₄ axis, four perpendicular C₂ axes, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and other symmetry elements, which places it in the **D₄h** point group.\n\nThis logical path correctly identified the answer as **D**. I am ready for the next question."
