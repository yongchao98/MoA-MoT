    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution.\n\n1.  **Test 1: Identical Stars (No Doppler)**\n    *   Input: Radius ratio = 1.0, Velocity of Star 1 = 0 km/s, Velocity of Star 2 = 0 km/s.\n    *   Expected Output: Luminosity ratio = 1.0. This is a sanity check.\n\n2.  **Test 2: Simple Case (No Doppler)**\n    *   Input: Radius ratio = 1.5, Velocity of Star 1 = 0 km/s, Velocity of Star 2 = 0 km/s.\n    *   Rationale: This tests the scenario where the radial velocities are ignored (or are both zero), meaning the intrinsic temperatures are identical. The luminosity ratio should be purely the square of the radius ratio.\n    *   Expected Output: 1.5² = 2.25. This corresponds to option C.\n\n3.  **Test 3: Problem's Values (with Doppler)**\n    *   Input: Radius ratio = 1.5, Velocity of Star 1 = 0 km/s, Velocity of Star 2 = 700 km/s.\n    *   Rationale: This is the main test case. It assumes \"wavelengths... appeared brightest\" refers to the *observed* peak wavelength. The Doppler effect from Star 2's velocity must be accounted for to find its true temperature, which affects the luminosity calculation.\n    *   Expected Output: ~2.23. This corresponds to option D.\n\n4.  **Test 4: Swapped Velocities**\n    *   Input: Radius ratio = 1.5, Velocity of Star 1 = 700 km/s, Velocity of Star 2 = 0 km/s.\n    *   Rationale: This tests the logic with a non-zero velocity for Star 1. The result should be slightly larger than 2.25.\n    *   Expected Output: ~2.27.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_luminosity_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the luminosity ratio problem using Test-Driven Development.\n\n    The solution function, tests, and final output are all contained here.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The solution function\n    def calculate_luminosity_ratio(r_ratio, v1_kms, v2_kms):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the ratio of luminosities (L1/L2) for two stars.\n\n        The calculation is based on the following physics principles:\n        1.

    "Excellent! The TDD process has confirmed the correctness of the solution logic. The code passed all specified tests, including the one representing the problem's specific parameters, and produced a result that aligns with one of the provided options.\n\nThe final calculation shows that the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229, which corresponds to option D.\n\nThe key steps were:\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** Start with the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which gives `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n2.  **Temperature Ratio:** Use Wien's law (`T ∝ 1/λ_rest`) to relate the temperature ratio to the ratio of rest-frame peak wavelengths: `T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁`.\n3.  **Doppler Shift:** The crucial insight is that \"appeared brightest\" refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (`λ_obs`). Since `λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂`, we can use the Doppler shift formula (`λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c)`) to connect the observed wavelengths to the rest-frame wavelengths.\n4.  **Combine and Solve:** This leads to the expression `T₁/T₂ = (1 + v₁/c) / (1 + v₂/c)`. Plugging in the given values (`R₁/R₂ = 1.5`, `v₁ = 0`, `v₂ = 700 km/s`) yields the final answer.\n\nThe calculation confirmed that Star 2's recession velocity means its intrinsic temperature must be slightly higher than Star 1's for their observed peak wavelengths to match. This temperature difference slightly reduces the luminosity ratio from the 2.25 value that would be expected if temperatures were identical.\n\n<<<D>>>"
