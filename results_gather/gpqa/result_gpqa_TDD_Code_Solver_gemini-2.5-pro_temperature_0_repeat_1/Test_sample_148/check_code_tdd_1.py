    Checks the correctness of the answer based on the experimental observations.

    The observations from the problem are:
    1.  LC-MS: Two separable peaks (LC) with the same mass (MS).
    2.  NMR: Two distinct signals for the same proton.

    This translates to the following constraints:
    - Are the species isomers? (same_mass = True)
    - Are the species separable by standard chromatography? (separable_by_lc = True)
    - Do the species have different NMR spectra in an achiral environment? (different_nmr = True)
