    "Here is the step-by-step application of Test-Driven Development to solve the problem.\n\n### 1) List of Tests\n\n1.  **Test 1 (Main Scenario):** The input reflects the exact observations from the problem description: two distinct NMR signals for one proton and two separable LC peaks that share the same mass. This is the classic signature of diastereomers. The expected output is 'D'.\n2.  **Test 2 (Enantiomers):** The input describes a scenario consistent with a mixture of enantiomers: a single set of NMR peaks and a single LC peak, as they are indistinguishable in an achiral environment. The expected output must not be 'D'.\n3.  **Test 3 (Impurity):** The input describes contamination with a precursor or side-product: two LC peaks with *different* masses. This is inconsistent with the problem's observation of identical mass spectra. The expected output must not be 'D'.\n4.  **Test 4 (Spin-Spin Coupling):** The input describes a single compound where an NMR peak is split into a doublet due to spin-spin coupling, but it would still appear as a single peak in the LC. This is explicitly ruled out in the problem description but serves as a good negative control. The expected output must not be 'D'.\n\n### 2) Python Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_analytical_mystery(observations):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes analytical chemistry data to determine the nature of a sample.\n\n    Args:\n        observations (dict): A dictionary describing the experimental results.\n            Keys: 'nmr_peaks' (int), 'lc_peaks' (int), 'lc_mass_spectra' (str: 'same' or 'different')\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The letter corresponding to the most likely explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    nmr_peaks = observations.get('nmr_peaks')\n    lc_peaks = observations.get('lc_peaks')\n    lc_mass = observations.get('lc_mass_spectra')\n\n    # The key evidence:\n    # 1.

    "Excellent! The TDD process correctly identified the answer. Here is a detailed explanation for why 'D' is the correct choice.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe combination of NMR and LC-MS data provides a clear and definitive answer. Let's break down the evidence:\n\n1.  **LC-MS Data:** The analysis shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC) that are separable, even at elevated temperatures. However, the mass spectrometer (MS) shows that both peaks have the *exact same mass*, which is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This tells us there are two different chemical species in the sample that are **isomers** (same formula, same mass) but have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), which allows them to be separated by chromatography.\n\n2.  **NMR Data:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This means the proton exists in two different, stable chemical environments. Since the two species are present in roughly equal amounts (based on equal integrals and equal LC peak intensities), it indicates a mixture of two related compounds.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. They would **not** separate on a standard LC column and would give the **exact same** NMR spectrum. Therefore, you would see only one LC peak and one set of NMR signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) Contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a different molecule. It would have a **different chemical formula and a different mass**. This contradicts the LC-MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' side-product:** This refers to a side reaction creating a larger molecule (e.g., a tripeptide instead of a dipeptide). Like a precursor, this impurity would have a **different and larger mass**. This contradicts the LC-MS data.\n\n*   **D) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other.\n    *   They have **different physical properties**, so they can be separated by standard chromatography. This explains the two LC peaks.\n    *   They are distinct molecules with different 3D arrangements, so their atoms are in **different chemical environments**. This explains why a single proton gives two different signals in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   They are **isomers**, so they have the same chemical formula and the same mass. This explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n\nThis option is the only one that perfectly accounts for all the experimental observations. A common source of diastereomers in peptide synthesis is the formation of **cis/trans isomers** across an amide bond (especially involving proline) or partial **racemization** at one of the chiral centers during a coupling step, creating a mix of, for example, L-L and D-L peptides."
