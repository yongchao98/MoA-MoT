    # Domain Knowledge Base:
    # 1. Context: The conversation happens in a "synthetic organic chemistry lab".
    # 2. Jargon: The key phrase is "compounds are on top of each other".
    # 3. Interpretation: In this context, this phrase is a common way to describe a failed separation
    #    using chromatography (e.g., Thin-Layer Chromatography or Column Chromatography).
    # 4. Scientific Principle: Chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their polarity.
    # 5. Conclusion: If compounds are "on top of each other" (i.e., they don't separate), it is because
    #    they have very similar polarities.
