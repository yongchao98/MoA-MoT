    llm_answer_text = "The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is common slang used by synthetic organic chemists. It almost always refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, which is the most common method for purifying compounds in this field.\n\n1.  **Chromatography:** Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography separate molecules based on their polarity. A solvent (the mobile phase) moves up a plate or down a column (the stationary phase).\n2.  **Separation:** Less polar compounds travel further with the solvent, while more polar compounds stick more strongly to the stationary phase and travel shorter distances.\n3.  **\"On top of each other\":** When visualized (e.g., on a TLC plate), separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If the compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at the same rate and appear as a single, overlapping spot. The chemist is lamenting that their purification has failed because the compounds are not separating.\n\n*   **A) Similar polarities:** This is the direct cause of the failed chromatographic separation described.\n*   **B) Similar optical rotations:** This is a property of chiral molecules and is measured with a polarimeter. It is unrelated to chromatographic separation.\n*   **C) Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions are the underlying physical reason for polarity, the phrase specifically describes the *outcome* of a separation technique governed by polarity, making (A) the more direct and accurate answer.\n*   **D) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, not chromatography. The slang for this issue is different (e.g., \"they form an azeotrope\" or \"they co-distill\").\n\nTherefore, the chemist is referring to the compounds having similar polarities.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    # --- Knowledge Base & Constraints ---
    # 1. The slang phrase "on top of each other" in synthetic organic chemistry refers to a failed separation.
    # 2. The most common separation technique where this visualization occurs is chromatography (TLC or column).
    # 3. Chromatography separates compounds based on their relative polarity.
    # 4. Therefore, a failed separation means the compounds have very similar polarities.
