    # Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # Structure: Et-C(Me)(OH) - C(Ph)(OH)-Et
    # Step 1: Carbocation Stability. The carbocation at C4 is tertiary and benzylic, making it more stable
    # than the tertiary carbocation at C3. Therefore, the -OH at C4 is protonated and leaves.
    # Step 2: Migratory Aptitude. The groups on the adjacent carbon (C3) are methyl and ethyl.
    # Ethyl has a higher migratory aptitude than methyl. Thus, the ethyl group migrates from C3 to C4.
    # Step 3: Product. The original C3 becomes a carbonyl, forming a ketone. The final structure is
    # 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.
    derived_product_A = "3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # Structure: Me-C(Ph)(OH) - C(p-OH-Ph)(OH)-Et
    # Step 1: Carbocation Stability. Both potential carbocations (at C2 and C3) are tertiary and benzylic.
    # However, the p-hydroxyphenyl group is a stronger electron-donating group than a phenyl group,
    # so it provides superior stabilization. The carbocation forms at C3.
    # Step 2: Migratory Aptitude. The groups on the adjacent carbon (C2) are methyl and phenyl.
    # Phenyl has a much higher migratory aptitude than methyl. The phenyl group migrates.
    # Step 3: Product. The original C2 becomes a carbonyl. The final structure is
    # 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.
    derived_product_B = "3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
    # Let Ar = 4-methoxyphenyl. Structure: Ar-C(Ar)(OH) - C(Ar)(OH)-Ph
    # Step 1: Carbocation Stability. The carbocation at C1 is stabilized by two strongly electron-donating
    # Ar groups. The carbocation at C2 is stabilized by one Ar and one phenyl group. The cation at C1 is more stable.
    # Step 2: Migratory Aptitude. The groups on the adjacent carbon (C2) are Ar and phenyl.
    # The p-methoxyphenyl group (Ar) has a higher migratory aptitude than phenyl. The Ar group migrates.
    # Step 3: Product. The original C2 becomes a carbonyl. The final structure is
    # 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one.
