    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the Pinacol rearrangement question.

    # Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # Carbocation formation: The carbocation at C4 is tertiary and benzylic, making it more stable than the tertiary carbocation at C3.
    # Migration: The groups on the adjacent C3 are methyl and ethyl. Ethyl has a higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # Resulting ketone: 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one

    # Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # Carbocation formation: The carbocation at C3 is stabilized by the strongly electron-donating 4-hydroxyphenyl group, making it more stable than the C2 carbocation stabilized by a regular phenyl group.
    # Migration: The groups on the adjacent C2 are methyl and phenyl. Phenyl has a higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # Resulting ketone: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one
    correct_product_B = "3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
    # Carbocation formation: The carbocation at C1 is stabilized by two strongly electron-donating 4-methoxyphenyl groups, making it more stable than the C2 carbocation (stabilized by one 4-methoxyphenyl and one phenyl group).
    # Migration: The groups on the adjacent C2 are phenyl and 4-methoxyphenyl. The 4-methoxyphenyl group has a higher migratory aptitude due to the electron-donating -OCH3 group.
    # Resulting ketone: 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one
