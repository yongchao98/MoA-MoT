def check_redshift_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the minimum redshift problem.

    The problem asks for the lower limit on the redshift (z) for the Lyman-alpha line
    (emitted at λ_emitted ≈ 1216 Å) to be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.

    The key constraints are:
    1. Emitted wavelength (Lyman-alpha): λ_emitted = 1216 Å. This is in the ultraviolet spectrum.
    2. Detection method: Ground-based optical telescopes. These are limited by the Earth's
       atmosphere, which absorbs most light with wavelengths shorter than the "optical window".
       The optical window starts at approximately 3500 Å (in the near-UV/violet range).
       Therefore, the minimum observable wavelength is λ_observed_min ≈ 3500 Å.

    The redshift formula is: λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z).
    To find the minimum redshift, we solve for z: z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1.
