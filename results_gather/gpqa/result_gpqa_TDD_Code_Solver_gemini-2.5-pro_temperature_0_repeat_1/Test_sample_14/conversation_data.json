    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution:\n\n1.  **Identity Test:** If two planetary systems are identical (same stellar radius, stellar mass, and orbital period), the ratio of their transit probabilities should be exactly 1.\n2.  **Stellar Mass Test:** If only the host star's mass differs (e.g., Star 1 is 8 times more massive than Star 2), the semi-major axis of Planet 1 will be larger (`a ∝ M_s^(1/3)`), reducing its transit probability. The probability ratio (P1/P2) should be `(1/8)^(1/3) = 0.5`.\n3.  **Orbital Period Test:** If only the orbital period differs (e.g., Planet 1's period is 1/8th that of Planet 2), its semi-major axis will be smaller (`a ∝ P^(2/3)`), increasing its transit probability. The probability ratio (P1/P2) should be `1 / ( (1/8)^2 )^(1/3) = (64)^(1/3) = 4`.\n4.  **Problem-Specific Test:** Using the values from the problem (Star 1 is twice as massive, Planet 1's period is 1/3 as long, stellar radii are equal), the expected ratio is `( (1) / (2 * (1/3)^2) )^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.651`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_transit_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This block contains the solution function, tests, and test runner\n    to determine the relative transit probability of two exoplanets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_probability_ratio(R_s1_div_R_s2, M_s1_div_M_s2, P1_div_P2):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the ratio of transit probability for Planet 1 vs. Planet 2.\n        The transit probability is given by P_transit ≈ R_star / a, where 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n        From Kepler's Third Law, a ∝ (M_star * P_orbit^2)^(1/3).\n        Therefore, P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P_orbit^2)^(1/3).\n        The ratio Prob_1 / Prob_2 is derived from this relationship.\n        \"\"\"\n        if M_s1_div_M_s2 <= 0 or P1_div_P2 == 0:\n            return float('inf') # Avoid math errors\n\n        # Ratio = (R_s1/R_s2) * [ (M_s2*P_2^2) / (M_s1*P_1^2) ]^(1/3)\n        # Ratio = (R_s1/R_s2) * [ 1 / ( (M_s1/M_s2) * (P_1/P_2)^2 ) ]^(1/3)\n        inner_term = 1 / (M_s1_div_M_s2 * (P1_div_P2**2))\n        ratio = R_s1_div_R_s2 * (inner_term**(1/3))\n        return ratio\n\n    # List of tests\n    tests = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Identity Test\",\n            \"inputs\": {\"R_s1_div_R_s2\": 1.0, \"M_s1_div_M_s2\": 1.0, \"P1_div_P2\": 1.0},\n            \"expected\": 1.0\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Stellar Mass Test\",\n            \"inputs\": {\"R_s1_div_R_s2\": 1.0, \"M_s1_div_M_s2\": 8.0, \"P1_div_P2\": 1.0},\n            \"expected\": 0.5\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Orbital Period Test\",\n            \"inputs\": {\"R_s1_div_R_s2\": 1.0, \"M_s1_div_M_s2\": 1.0, \"P1_div_P2\": 1.0/8.0},\n            \"expected\": 4.0\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Problem-Specific Test\",\n            \"inputs\": {\n                \"R_s1_div_R_s2\": 1.0,  # both host stars have the same radii\n                \"M_s1_div_M_s2\": 2.0,  # star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\n                \"P1_div_P2\": 1.0/3.0 # orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter\n            },\n            \"expected\": (9.0/2.0)**(1/3)\n        }\n    ]\n\n    # Test runner\n    for i, test in enumerate(tests):\n        inputs = test[\"inputs\"]\n        result = calculate_probability_ratio(**inputs)\n        expected = test[\"expected\"]\n        if not math.isclose(result, expected, rel_tol=1e-9):\n            print(f\"Test {i+1} '{test['name']}' failed:\")\n            print(f\"  Inputs: {inputs}\")\n            print(f\"  Expected: {expected}, Got: {result}\")\n            return\n\n    # Final calculation and result\n    final_inputs = tests[-1][\"inputs\"]\n    final_ratio = calculate_probability_ratio(**final_inputs)\n    \n    # The ratio is > 1, so Planet_1 is preferred.\n    # The value ~1.65 matches option D.\n    print(\"All tests passed\")\n    print(f\"The probability of Planet_1 transiting is ~{final_ratio:.2f} times higher than for Planet_2.

    "The user wants me to use Test-Driven Development (TDD) to solve a problem about exoplanet transit probabilities.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is approximately `P_transit ≈ R_star / a`, where `R_star` is the radius of the star and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. This assumes a random inclination of the orbit.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (`P_orbit`), the semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of the host star (`M_star`). The law states: `P_orbit² ∝ a³ / M_star`.\n*   **Deriving the Relationship:**\n    1.  From Kepler's Third Law, we can express `a` in terms of `P_orbit` and `M_star`: `a³ ∝ M_star * P_orbit²`, which means `a ∝ (M_star * P_orbit²)^(1/3)`.\n    2.  Substitute this expression for `a` into the transit probability formula: `P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P_orbit²)^(1/3)`.\n\n**2. Define the Ratios**\n\nLet's denote the properties of Planet_1's system with subscript 1 and Planet_2's system with subscript 2. We want to find the ratio of their transit probabilities: `Prob_1 / Prob_2`.\n\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = [ R_s1 / (M_s1 * P_1²)^(1/3) ] / [ R_s2 / (M_s2 * P_2²)^(1/3) ]`\n\nRearranging this gives:\n\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThis can be further simplified for easier calculation:\n\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [ 1 / ( (M_s1 / M_s2) * (P_1 / P_2)² ) ]^(1/3)`\n\n**3. Extract Values from the Problem Statement**\n\n*   \"both host stars have the same radii\" -> `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   \"The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\" -> `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`.\n*   \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\" -> `P_1 = P_2 / 3`, so `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3`.\n\n**4. Set up TDD Steps**\n\n*   **Step 1: List Tests**\n    *   **Identity Case:** If all ratios (`R_s1/R_s2`, `M_s1/M_s2`, `P_1/P_2`) are 1, the final probability ratio should be 1. This is a good sanity check.\n    *   **Stellar Mass Case:** If only stellar mass differs (e.g., `M_s1/M_s2 = 8`, others are 1), the ratio should be `1 * (1 / 8)^(1/3) = 0.5`. A more massive star for the same period means a larger orbit, thus a lower transit probability.\n    *   **Orbital Period Case:** If only the period differs (e.g., `P_1/P_2 = 1/8`, others are 1), the ratio should be `1 * (1 / (1/8)²)^(1/3) = (64)^(1/3) = 4`. A shorter period means a smaller orbit, thus a higher transit probability.\n    *   **Problem-Specific Case:** Use the values from the problem: `R_s1/R_s2 = 1`, `M_s1/M_s2 = 2`, `P_1/P_2 = 1/3`. The expected result is `1 * [ 1 / (2 * (1/3)²) ]^(1/3) = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Write Python Code**\n    *   Implement a function `calculate_probability_ratio(R_s1_div_R_s2, M_s1_div_M_s2, P1_div_P2)` based on the derived formula.\n    *   Implement the tests listed above.\n    *   Create a test runner that checks each test and prints the status.\n    *   If all tests pass, calculate the final answer for the problem and print it.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nUsing the formula and the problem's values:\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = 1 * [ 1 / ( 2 * (1/3)² ) ]^(1/3)`\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = [ 1 / ( 2 * 1/9 ) ]^(1/3)`\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3)`\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, let's estimate the cube root of 4.5:\n*   `1³ = 1`\n*   `2³ = 8`\nThe value is between 1 and 2.\n*   `1.5³ = 3.375`\n*   `1.6³ = 4.096`\n*   `1.7³ = 4.913`\nSo the value is between 1.6 and 1.7.\n`1.65³ ≈ 4.492`\nThis is very close to 4.5.\n\nSo, `Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65`.\n\nSince the ratio is greater than 1, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. The ratio is approximately 1.65. This matches option D.\n\nThe TDD process confirms this logic and calculation. The code passed all tests, including the problem-specific one, and yielded a result of ~1.65, leading to the conclusion that Planet_1 is preferred and its transit probability is ~1.65 times higher. The transit probability (`P_transit`) is proportional to the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_star`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`):\n`P_transit ∝ R_star / a`\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (`a`) is related to the orbital period (`P_orbit`) and the stellar mass (`M_star`):\n`a³ ∝ M_star * P_orbit²`\n`a ∝ (M_star * P_orbit²)^(1/3)`\n\nSubstituting this into the probability formula:\n`P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P_orbit²)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find which planet is preferred, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities (`P_transit,1 / P_transit,2`). Let's denote the ratios of the stellar radii, stellar masses, and orbital periods as follows:\n*   `R_ratio = R_star,1 / R_star,2`\n*   `M_ratio = M_star,1 / M_star,2`\n*   `P_ratio = P_orbit,1 / P_orbit,2`\n\nThe probability ratio is then:\n`Prob_ratio = (R_ratio) * [1 / (M_ratio * P_ratio²)]^(1/3)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n*   The stars have the same radii: `R_ratio = 1`\n*   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive: `M_ratio = 2`\n*   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter: `P_ratio = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`Prob_ratio = (1) * [1 / (2 * (1/3)²)]^(1/3)`\n`Prob_ratio = [1 / (2 * 1/9)]^(1/3)`\n`Prob_ratio = [1 / (2/9)]^(1/3)`\n`Prob_ratio = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n`Prob_ratio = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.651`\n\nThe ratio is approximately 1.65, and since it is greater than 1, Planet_1 has the higher probability of transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\n<<<D>>>"
