    # P1 = P2 / 3  => P1 / P2 = 1/3
    P1_div_P2 = 1.0 / 3.0

    # --- Step 2: Use the physical formulas to derive the probability ratio ---
    # The probability of a transit (P_transit) for a circular orbit is proportional to the
    # stellar radius (R_s) divided by the planet's semi-major axis (a).
    # P_transit ∝ R_s / a

    # From Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis 'a' is related to the orbital period (P)
    # and the stellar mass (M_s) as follows:
    # a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2  =>  a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)

    # Substituting 'a' into the transit probability formula:
    # P_transit ∝ R_s / (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)

    # We want to find the ratio of probabilities: P_transit_1 / P_transit_2
    # Ratio = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1^2)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2^2)^(1/3)]
    # Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2)]^(1/3)
    # Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [ (1 / (M_s1/M_s2)) * (1 / (P1/P2)^2) ]^(1/3)
