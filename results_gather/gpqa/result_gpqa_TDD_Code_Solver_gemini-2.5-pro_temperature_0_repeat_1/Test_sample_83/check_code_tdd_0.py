    # Option A: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation.
    # A fractional (rational) approximation R(A) = P(A)[Q(A)]^-1 is applied to a vector v.
    # Sequentially, this is one large linear system solve.
    # Using partial fraction expansion, R(z) can be written as a sum of simpler terms, e.g., sum(c_i / (z - r_i)).
    # This allows R(A)v to be computed as a sum of independent terms: sum(c_i * (A - r_i*I)^-1 * v).
    # Each term corresponds to an independent linear system solve, which can be done in parallel.
    # This is the core principle of "parallelism across the method". So, A is the key factor.

    # Option B: Complex roots of fractional approximation.
    # The roots (real or complex) are a property of the denominator of the fractional approximation.
    # Their existence is necessary for the partial fraction expansion, but the nature of the roots
    # (complex vs. real) is a detail, not the fundamental enabling factor for parallelization.
    # The decomposition itself is the key.

    # Option C: Stability analysis.

    analysis_C = False

    # Option D: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions.

    # global dependencies that make parallelization *more difficult*, not easier.
