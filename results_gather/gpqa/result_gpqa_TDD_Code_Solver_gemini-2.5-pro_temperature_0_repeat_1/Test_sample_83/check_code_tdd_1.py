    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the question about parallelizing
    the solution of higher-dimensional heat equations.

    The question asks for the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm
    into a parallel one when using fractional approximations for the matrix
    exponential function.

    The correct principle is that Partial Fraction Decomposition of the rational
    (fractional) approximation allows a large, coupled linear system to be
    broken down into several smaller, independent linear systems that can be
    solved in parallel. This is what "Linear partial fraction of fractional
    approximation" refers to.
