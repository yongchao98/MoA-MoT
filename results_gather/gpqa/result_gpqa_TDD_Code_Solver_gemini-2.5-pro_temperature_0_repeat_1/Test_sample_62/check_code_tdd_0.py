    # --- Problem Parameters ---

    # --- Physics Calculation ---

    # 1. Convert all parameters to base SI units (kg, m)

    R_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10

    # μ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)
    mu_kg = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)

    # 3. Calculate the moment of inertia (I) of the molecule
    # I = μ * R^2
    I = mu_kg * R_m**2

    # 4. Calculate the rotational constant (B) in Joules
    # B = ħ^2 / (2 * I)
    B = H_BAR**2 / (2 * I)

    # 5. Determine the energy of the transition (ΔE)
    # The molecule starts in the fundamental (ground) state: v=0, J=0.
    # For photon absorption, the selection rules are Δv=+1 and ΔJ=+1.
    # Therefore, the next lowest energy state reachable is v=1, J=1.
    # The energy of a state (v, J) is E(v,J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J*(J+1).
    # ΔE = E(1,1) - E(0,0)
    # ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + B*1*(1+1)] - [(1/2)ħω + B*0*(0+1)]
    # ΔE = ħω + 2B
    delta_E = (H_BAR * w_rad_s) + (2 * B)
