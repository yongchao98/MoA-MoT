def check_correctness_of_rovibrational_transition():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by recalculating the
    physical quantities from the ground up based on the non-rigid rotor model.

    The problem asks for the momentum of a photon required to excite a diatomic
    molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

    The energy levels of a non-rigid rotor are given by:
    E(v, J) = (v + 1/2) * h_bar * w + B * J * (J + 1)
    where:
    - v: vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)
    - J: rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)
    - h_bar: reduced Planck constant
    - w: angular frequency of vibration
    - B: rotational constant, B = h_bar^2 / (2 * I)
    - I: moment of inertia, I = mu * R^2
    - mu: reduced mass, mu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)

    The transition follows the selection rules delta_v = +1 and delta_J = +1.
    - Initial state (fundamental): v=0, J=0
    - Final state (next lowest energy): v=1, J=1

    The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these states:
    delta_E = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)
            = [(3/2)*h_bar*w + 2*B] - [(1/2)*h_bar*w]
            = h_bar*w + 2*B

    The photon's momentum is then p = delta_E / c.

    The code will calculate this value and check if it matches one of the given options,
    thereby verifying the statement that "the final answer is consistent with the calculations".
