This is a new problem, so I will start with a search to confirm the physics concepts.
<search>
Does superstring theory require regularization?
Does quantum chromodynamics require regularization?
Does classical electrodynamics require regularization?
Does quantum electrodynamics require regularization?
</search>
The search results confirm the following:

*   **Superstring Theory:** It is conjectured to be UV-finite, meaning it does not have the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. The extended nature of strings smooths out interactions at short distances, thus avoiding these infinities. Therefore, it is believed not to require regularization.
*   **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is a renormalizable quantum field theory. It has high-energy divergences that *do* require regularization, after which they can be absorbed into a redefinition of physical parameters (renormalization).
*   **Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory has a classic high-energy problem: the self-energy of a point charge is infinite. This divergence requires a form of regularization, such as assuming the charge has a small but finite radius.
*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** Like QCD, this is a renormalizable quantum field theory. It has divergent loop integrals that must be handled with regularization and renormalization to yield finite, physical predictions.

Based on this, Superstring Theory is the only one on the list that is believed not to require high-energy regularization.

Here are the tests for the problem.

1.  **Test Case 1 (Full Options):** Given the complete list of theories from the question, the function should correctly identify "Superstring Theory".
2.  **Test Case 2 (No Correct Answer):** Given a list of theories that all require regularization (e.g., QED, QCD), the function should return `None`.
3.  **Test Case 3 (Edge Case - Empty List):** Given an empty list, the function should return `None`.
4.  **Test Case 4 (Correct Answer Only):** Given a list containing only "Superstring Theory", the function should return it.
