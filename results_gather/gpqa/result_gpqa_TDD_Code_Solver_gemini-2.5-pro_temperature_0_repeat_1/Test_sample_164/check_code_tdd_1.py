    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding ethylene polymerization.

    The question asks to identify the correct statement about creating a branched polymer
    from only ethylene using a dual-catalyst system. This process is known as tandem catalysis,
    where one catalyst oligomerizes ethylene to an alpha-olefin (like 1-hexene), and a second
    catalyst copolymerizes this alpha-olefin with more ethylene.

    The function evaluates each statement based on established chemical and industrial facts
    to determine the ground truth, and then compares the LLM's answer to this ground truth.

    # --- Ground Truth Evaluation ---
    # We establish the factual correctness of each statement independently.

    # Statement A: "One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators."
    # Fact: This is correct. Chromium (Cr), a Group VIa metal, is the basis for the most prominent
    # industrial catalysts for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene. This is the
    # "essential additional reaction step" to create the comonomer for branching.
    is_A_correct = True
    reason_A = "Statement A is correct. Chromium (Group VIa) catalysts are a cornerstone for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene."

    # Statement B: "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US."
    # Fact: This is correct. Companies like Chevron Phillips Chemical (e.g., Advanced Dual Loop technology)
    # and Dow (e.g., UNIPOL process with tandem catalysts) have commercialized this technology in the US.
    is_B_correct = True
    reason_B = "Statement B is correct. Industrial processes from US-based companies utilize this technology."

    # Statement C: "Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive."
    # Fact: This is correct. Catalysts based on noble metals like Palladium (Pd) are known to
    # oligomerize ethylene. However, their high cost makes them economically unviable for producing
    # a commodity polymer like polyethylene compared to first-row transition metals like Cr or Ni.
    is_C_correct = True
    reason_C = "Statement C is correct. Noble metals can catalyze the reaction but are too expensive for this application."

    # Statement D: "Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step."
    # Fact: This is incorrect. The oligomerization step with Cr-based catalysts almost universally
    # requires an aluminum-based activator (co-catalyst), such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or other
    # alkylaluminum compounds. They are essential for the catalyst system to function.
    is_D_correct = False
    reason_D = "Statement D is incorrect because aluminum-based activators (like MAO) are in fact essential for activating the Group VIa oligomerization catalysts."
