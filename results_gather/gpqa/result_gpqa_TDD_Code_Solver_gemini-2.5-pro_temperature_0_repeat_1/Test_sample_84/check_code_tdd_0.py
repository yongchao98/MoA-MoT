    # The equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), where 'a' is the semi-major axis.
    # So, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).
    # The radial velocity amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ.
    # For a circular orbit, K is also proportional to m_p / sqrt(a).
    # Therefore, Δλ is proportional to m_p / sqrt(a).
    # Rearranging for 'a', we get a is proportional to (m_p / Δλ)^2.
    # The ratio a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / Δλ_2)^2 / (m_p1 / Δλ_1)^2.
    # Substituting this into the temperature ratio:
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = (m_p2 / m_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2).
