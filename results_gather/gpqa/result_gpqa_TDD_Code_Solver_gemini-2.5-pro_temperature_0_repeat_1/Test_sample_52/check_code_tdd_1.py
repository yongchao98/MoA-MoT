    # - Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring: This implies a C6H4 core.
    #   - Carbons: 6, Hydrogens: 4
    # - Ester group (-COO-): This implies 2 oxygen atoms.
    #   - Oxygens: 2
    # - 1H NMR data analysis:
    #   - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and one -CH3 signal
    #     strongly indicate a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).
    #     - This adds 3 carbons (C-C-C).
    #     - This adds 5 hydrogens (1 vinyl H + 1 vinyl H + 3 methyl H).
    #   - A second -CH3 signal with no -CH2 signals, associated with the ester group,
    #     points to a methyl ester (-COOCH3).
    #     - This adds 1 carbon (from the carbonyl C=O).
    #     - This adds 1 carbon (from the methyl O-CH3).
    #     - This adds 3 hydrogens (from the methyl O-CH3).

    # Tallying the atoms:
    carbon_count = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (ester methyl)  # 11
    hydrogen_count = 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester methyl)  # 12
