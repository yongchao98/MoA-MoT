        # --- Step 1: Analyze the key reaction (Ozonolysis) ---
        # The problem states that Product 2 reacts with ozone. This is an ozonolysis reaction,
        # which specifically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).
        # This is the most critical fact, as it dictates that Product 2 must be unsaturated.
        # Since the starting material (adamantane derivative) is saturated, a rearrangement
        # must have occurred in the first step to create a C=C bond. The most plausible
        # rearrangement of an adamantane cage under harsh basic conditions is to a
        # bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. This reasoning is sound.

        # --- Step 2: Identify the protons being analyzed ---
        # Ozonolysis with a reductive workup (DMS) converts the two carbons of the C=C bond
        # into two aldehyde (-CHO) groups (assuming they were not fully substituted).
        # Aldehyde protons are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in a molecule,
        # appearing at ~9-10 ppm in an NMR spectrum. The question asks for the coupling
        # pattern of these protons.

        # --- Step 3: Determine the coupling based on the precursor structure ---
        # The coupling of an aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons (n) on the
        # adjacent carbon atom, following the n+1 rule. We need to analyze the neighbors
        # of the C=C bond in the plausible precursor, a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonene derivative.
        #
        # In a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton, there are two bridgehead carbons which are
        # methines (-CH-), and the other carbons in the rings are methylenes (-CH2-).
        # A double bond, for instance between C2 and C3, would have the following neighbors:
        # - The carbon at position C2 is adjacent to the bridgehead C1 (a methine with 1 proton).
        # - The carbon at position C3 is adjacent to C4 (a methylene with 2 protons).
        
        # Therefore, after ozonolysis, two different aldehyde environments are created:
        # 1. Aldehyde from C2: This is attached to C1, which has n=1 proton.
        #    The coupling pattern will be a doublet (n+1 = 2).
        # 2. Aldehyde from C3: This is attached to C4, which has n=2 protons.
        #    The coupling pattern will be a triplet (n+1 = 3).
