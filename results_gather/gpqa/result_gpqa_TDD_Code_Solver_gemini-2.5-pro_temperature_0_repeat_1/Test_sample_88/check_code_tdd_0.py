    # Constraint B: Product 2 is formed by Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of Product 1.
    # MPV reduction converts a carbonyl (C=O) to an alcohol (C-OH) and does not affect C=C bonds.
    # Therefore, if Product 2 has a C=C bond, Product 1 must have had it as well.

    # --- Step 2: Verify the deduction about skeletal rearrangement ---
    # The starting material is a derivative of adamantane (C10H16), which is tricyclic.
    # Product 1 has a formula of C10H14O (deduced from the 14H in NMR and the C=O from IR).
    # Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C10H14O.
    # DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4.

    dou_hypothetical_tricyclic_enone = 5

    # Conclusion 2: The DoU of Product 1 (4) does not match that of a tricyclic enone (5).
    # This means the adamantane skeleton must have opened to reduce the number of rings.
    # A bicyclic enone would have DoU = 2 (rings) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) = 4. This is consistent.

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the final product based on a plausible rearranged structure ---
    # A common rearrangement of adamantane leads to the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton.
    # A plausible structure for Product 2 (the unsaturated alcohol) is bicyclo[3.3.1]non-2-en-7-methanol.
    # Ozonolysis of this structure cleaves the C2=C3 double bond, opening one of the rings.
    # This creates two aldehyde groups (-CHO) at the positions of the former C2 and C3 atoms.
    # These aldehyde protons are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in Product 3.

    # We must determine the coupling (splitting) of these two aldehyde protons.
    # The coupling is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) via the n+1 rule.

    # Aldehyde from C3: The original C3 atom was bonded to C4. In the product, the C3-aldehyde is still bonded to the C4-carbon, which is a methylene group (-CH2-).
    # Number of neighbors (n) = 2.
    neighbors_of_aldehyde_from_C3 = 2

    # Aldehyde from C2: The original C2 atom was bonded to C1. In the product, the C2-aldehyde is still bonded to the C1-carbon, which is a methine group (-CH-).
