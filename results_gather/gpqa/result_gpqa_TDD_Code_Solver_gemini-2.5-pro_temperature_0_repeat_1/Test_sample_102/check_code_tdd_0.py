    Analyzes the chemical validity of the synthesis proposed in option D.

    The question asks for a high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

A fundamental constraint of this reaction is that it fails on aromatic rings that are moderately or strongly deactivated. The intermediate from step (ii) is 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), which is a strong deactivator. The presence of the -NO2 group deactivates the ring to such an extent that the Friedel-Crafts acylation will not proceed, or will give an extremely low yield. Therefore, this sequence cannot be used for a high-yield synthesis of the target product."
