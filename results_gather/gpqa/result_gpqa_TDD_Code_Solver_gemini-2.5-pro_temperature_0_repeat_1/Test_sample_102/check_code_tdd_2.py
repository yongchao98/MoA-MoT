def check_synthesis_correctness():
    """
    Analyzes the correctness of the LLM's answer for a multi-step synthesis problem.

    The function evaluates each option based on key organic chemistry principles:
    1.  **Reaction Feasibility**: Checks for known reaction limitations, such as the failure of
        Friedel-Crafts reactions on certain substrates.
    2.  **Regioselectivity**: Considers the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring.
    3.  **High-Yield Constraint**: Assesses whether a reaction step will produce a single major
        product (high-yield) or a mixture of isomers (low-yield).

    The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This has an acetyl group (-COCH3),
    a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-substitution pattern.

    # i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone. (Valid)
    # ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone. (Valid: -COCH3 is a meta-director, so this step is regioselective and high-yield).
    # iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Target.
    #    - On the ring are: -COCH3 (meta-director) and -Br (ortho,para-director).
    #    - The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 to position 5.
    #    - The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 to positions 2, 4, and 6.
    #    - Since the directing effects are in conflict, the reaction will produce a mixture of several isomers.
