def check_correctness():
    """
    This function verifies the correctness of the provided answer by calculating the energies
    of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical
    spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.

    The core logic is as follows:
    1.  The particles are spin-1/2, so they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
    2.  This means each single-particle energy level 'n' can be occupied by at most two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).
    3.  The energy of a single particle in level 'n' is given by E_n = n^2 * E, where E is the base energy unit.
    4.  The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of all four particles.
    5.  The ground state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy.
    6.  Excited states are configurations with higher total energies. The first excited state is the second-lowest unique energy, the second excited state is the third-lowest, and so on.
