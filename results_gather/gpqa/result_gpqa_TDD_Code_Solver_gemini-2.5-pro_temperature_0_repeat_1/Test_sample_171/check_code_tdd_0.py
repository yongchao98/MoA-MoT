    # 1. Define problem constants and relationships from the question.
    # The ratio of excited atoms in star 1 is twice that in star 2.
    # Let R be the ratio of the population of the excited state to a reference state (e.g., ground state).
    # R is proportional to exp(-ΔE / (k*T)), where C is a constant related to statistical weights.
    # R1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T1))
    # R2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T2))
    # The problem states: R1 = 2 * R2
    
    # The energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.
    # The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.
    # The problem is set up such that the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1 K.
    delta_E_over_k = 1.0  # Unit: Kelvin

    # 2. Derive the correct equation from the physical principles.
    # From R1 = 2 * R2, we get:
    # C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k*T2))
    # exp(-ΔE / (k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k*T2))
    #
    # Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:
    # ln(exp(-ΔE / (k*T1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k*T2)))
    # -ΔE / (k*T1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k*T2)))
    # -ΔE / (k*T1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k*T2)
    #
    # Rearrange the terms to solve for ln(2):
    # ΔE / (k*T2) - ΔE / (k*T1) = ln(2)
    # (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)
    #
    # Simplify the fraction and substitute ΔE/k = 1:
    # 1.0 * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2) ) = ln(2)
    #
    # So, the derived correct relationship is: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)

    # 3. Compare the derived equation with the given options.
    # The options are expressions for ln(2).
    # A) T2 / T1
    # B) (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)^2
    # C) (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)
    # D) (T1 + T2) / (T1*T2)

    # 5. Further check the LLM's reasoning.
    # The LLM's derivation steps are:
    # 1. exp(-ΔE / kT_1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT_2) -> Correct
    # 2. -ΔE / kT_1 = ln(2) - ΔE / kT_2 -> Correct
    # 3. ΔE/k * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2) -> Correct
    # 4. ΔE/k ≈ 1 K -> Correct interpretation of the problem's numbers
    # 5. (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) = ln(2) -> Correct final derivation
    # The LLM's derivation is sound.

    # 6. Check the LLM's TDD implementation logic.
    # The logic is to generate (T1, T2) pairs that satisfy the derived equation and test which option holds.
    # Let's perform a quick numerical check to validate this.
    # From our derived equation: 1/T2 = ln(2) + 1/T1
