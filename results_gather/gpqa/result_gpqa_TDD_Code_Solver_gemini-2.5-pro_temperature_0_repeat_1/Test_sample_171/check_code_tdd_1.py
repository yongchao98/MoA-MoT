    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided options for the stellar temperature relationship.

    The function follows these steps:
    1.  Derives the correct physical relationship from the Boltzmann equation.
    2.  Uses the problem's given values to simplify the relationship, noting that ΔE/k ≈ 1.
    3.  This derivation directly leads to Option C.
    4.  To provide a concrete check, it calculates a pair of temperatures (T1, T2)
        that satisfy the derived physical law.
    5.  It then tests which of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) holds true
        for this temperature pair.

    # The provided "answer" from the other LLM is conversational.
    # This code will check the physics of the problem to determine the correct option.
    # Based on the derivation, the correct option should be C.

    # --- Step 1: Define constants and assumptions from the problem ---
    # The problem states ΔE is approximately 1.38e-23 J.
    # The Boltzmann constant k is ~1.380649e-23 J/K.
    # This implies the simplification ΔE/k = 1 is intended.
    delta_E_over_k = 1.0

    # The derived physical law is: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)
    # With the simplification, this becomes: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)
    # This is exactly Option C.

    # --- Step 2: Numerical Verification ---
    # We will now verify this numerically. Let's find a pair of temperatures (T1, T2)
    # that satisfy the physical law and then test the options.
    # From ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1), we can solve for T1 given a T2.
    # 1/T1 = 1/T2 - ln(2) / (ΔE/k)
    # For T1 to be positive, we need 1/T2 > ln(2), so T2 < 1/ln(2) ≈ 1.44 K.
    # This indicates the problem is a conceptual exercise, not a realistic scenario.
    # We proceed with a valid temperature for the given formula.

        T2 = 1.2  # A value less than 1.44 K

        # Target value for the equations
        target_lhs = np.log(2)

        # --- Step 3: Evaluate each option's formula (RHS) ---
        # Option A: T2 / T1
        rhs_A = T2 / T1
        # Option B: (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)^2
        rhs_B = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)**2
        # Option C: (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)
        rhs_C = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)
        # Option D: (T1 + T2) / (T1*T2)
