    # This is a fundamental failure to address the user's prompt.

    # --- Verification of the Original Question's Correct Answer ---
    # To provide a full analysis, we solve the original question.
    
    # Given values from the original question:
    T_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4
    T_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3
    # The mass ratios and albedo value are distractors and not needed for the calculation.

    # Physics Principles:
    # 1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) vs. Orbital Radius (a):
    # For a planet in thermal equilibrium, the power absorbed from the star equals the power radiated.
    # This leads to the relationship: T_eq^4 ∝ 1/a^2, which simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a).
    # Therefore, a ∝ 1/T_eq^2.

    # 2. Kepler's Third Law:
    # The square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).
    # P^2 ∝ a^3, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).

    # 3. Combining the relationships:
    # Since 'a' is proportional to both P^(2/3) and 1/T_eq^2, we can set them proportional to each other:
    # P^(2/3) ∝ 1/T_eq^2
    # To solve for P, we raise both sides to the power of 3/2:
    # (P^(2/3))^(3/2) ∝ (1/T_eq^2)^(3/2)
    # P ∝ 1/T_eq^3
    # This means the ratio of two periods is the inverse cube of their temperature ratios:
    # P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3

    # Calculation:
    # First, find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3.
    T_eq1_over_T_eq3 = T_eq1_over_T_eq2 * T_eq2_over_T_eq3
    # T_eq1_over_T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22

    # Now, calculate the final period ratio.
    P3_over_P1 = T_eq1_over_T_eq3 ** 3
    # P3_over_P1 = 3.22^3
    calculated_result = 3.22**3  # Approximately 33.386

    # The options for the original question were:
    # A) ~ 33.4
    # B) ~ 3.2
    # C) ~ 10.4
    # D) ~ 4.4
    
    # The calculated result (~33.4) matches option A.
