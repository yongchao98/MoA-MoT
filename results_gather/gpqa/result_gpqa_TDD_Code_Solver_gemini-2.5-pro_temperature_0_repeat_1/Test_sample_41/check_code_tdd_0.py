    # Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2

    # Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3

    # The mass ratios and the specific albedo value are irrelevant information,
    # as the derivation depends only on the temperature ratios, assuming the planets
    # orbit the same star and have the same albedo.
    
    # --- Physics Derivation ---
    # The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (a)
    # by T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a), assuming the same star and albedo.
    # Therefore, T_i / T_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i).
    
    # Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period (P) is related to the orbital distance (a)
    # by P^2 ∝ a^3, or P ∝ a^(3/2).
    # Therefore, P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2).
    
    # We can combine these two relationships to relate period and temperature:
    # From the temperature relation, a_i / a_j = (T_j / T_i)^2.
    # Substituting this into the period relation:
    # P_i / P_j = ((T_j / T_i)^2)^(3/2) = (T_j / T_i)^3.
    
    # We need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1,
    # which is the ratio P3 / P1.
    # Using the derived formula: P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)^3.
    
    # We can find the ratio T1 / T3 by multiplying the given ratios:
    # T1 / T3 = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3)
    
    # --- Calculation ---
    # Calculate the overall temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3
    temp_ratio_13 = temp_ratio_12 * temp_ratio_23
    
    # Calculate the final period ratio P3 / P1
    calculated_period_ratio = temp_ratio_13 ** 3
