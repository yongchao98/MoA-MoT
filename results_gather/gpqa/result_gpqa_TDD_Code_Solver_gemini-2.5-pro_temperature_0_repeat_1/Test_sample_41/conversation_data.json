    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution:\n1.  **Identity Case:** If the temperature ratios are both 1 (i.e., T1/T2 = 1 and T2/T3 = 1), the planets have the same equilibrium temperature, implying they are at the same orbital distance. Therefore, their orbital periods should be the same, and the ratio P3/P1 should be 1.\n2.  **Simple Integer Case:** If T1/T2 = 2 and T2/T3 = 2, then T1/T3 = 4. The relationship between period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq) for planets around the same star with the same albedo is P ∝ 1/T_eq³. Therefore, P3/P1 = (T_eq1/T_eq3)³ = 4³ = 64.\n3.  **Problem Case:** Using the given values, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. The expected result is P3/P1 = (1.4 * 2.3)³ = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.386. This should match option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_period_ratio(temp_ratio_12, temp_ratio_23, mass_ratio_12, mass_ratio_23, albedo):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1 (P3/P1).\n\n    The derivation is as follows:\n    1. The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n       T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n       where 'a' is the orbital distance and 'A' is the albedo.\n    2. For two planets around the same star with the same albedo, the ratio of their temperatures is:\n       T_eq_i / T_eq_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i)\n    3. Kepler's Third Law states P^2 ∝ a^3, where P is the orbital period.\n       So, P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2).\n    4. Combining these, we can express the period ratio in terms of the temperature ratio:\n       a_i / a_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^2\n       P_i / P_j = ((T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^2)^(3/2) = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^3\n    5. We want to find P3 / P1, which is equal to (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3.\n    6. We can find T_eq1 / T_eq3 by multiplying the given ratios:\n       T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\n    7. Therefore, P3 / P1 = ((T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3))^3.\n\n    Note: The planet masses and the specific albedo value are not needed for this calculation,\n    as long as the albedo is the same for all planets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Calculate the overall temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3\n    temp_ratio_13 = temp_ratio_12 * temp_ratio_23\n    \n    # Calculate the period ratio P3 / P1\n    period_ratio_31 = temp_ratio_13 ** 3\n    \n    return period_ratio_31\n\n# --- TDD Tests ---\ntests = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Identity Case\",\n        \"inputs\": {\"temp_ratio_12\": 1.0, \"temp_ratio_23\": 1.0, \"mass_ratio_12\": 1.0, \"mass_ratio_23\": 1.0, \"albedo\": 0.3},\n        \"expected\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Simple Integer Case\",\n        \"inputs\": {\"temp_ratio_12\": 2.0, \"temp_ratio_23\": 2.0, \"mass_ratio_12\": 1.0, \"mass_ratio_23\": 1.0, \"albedo\": 0.5},\n        \"expected\": 64.0\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Problem Case\",\n        \"inputs\": {\"temp_ratio_12\": 1.4, \"temp_ratio_23\": 2.3, \"mass_ratio_12\": 1.15, \"mass_ratio_23\": 1.35, \"albedo\": 0.3},\n        \"expected\": 33.386248\n    }\n]\n\n# --- Test Runner ---\nall_passed = True\nfor i, test in enumerate(tests):\n    args = test[\"inputs\"]\n    result = solve_period_ratio(**args)\n    expected = test[\"expected\"]\n    \n    # Using a small tolerance for floating point comparison\n    if not math.isclose(result, expected, rel_tol=1e-5):\n        print(f\"Test '{test['name']}' failed.\")\n        print(f\"  Input: {args}\")\n        print(f\"  Expected: {expected}, Got: {result}\")\n        all_passed = False\n        break\n\nif all_passed:\n    # Calculate the final answer for the problem\n    final_answer = solve_period_ratio(temp_ratio_12=1.4, temp_ratio_23=2.3, mass_ratio_12=1.15, mass_ratio_23=1.35, albedo=0.3)\n    print(f\"All tests passed\\nThe final answer is ~{final_answer:.1f}\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
