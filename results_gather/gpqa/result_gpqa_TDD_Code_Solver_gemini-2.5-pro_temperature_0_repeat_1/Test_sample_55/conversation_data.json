    "Here are the small, explicit tests the solution is expected to satisfy, based on the principles of atomic transitions:\n\n1.  **Selection Rules Test:** A transition from state `|n, l, m>` to `|n', l', m'>` is only allowed if the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, `Δl = l' - l`, is `±1`, and the change in the magnetic quantum number, `Δm = m' - m`, is `0` or `±1`.\n    *   `|3,0,0> -> |2,1,0>` should be **allowed** (`Δl=+1`, `Δm=0`).\n    *   `|2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>` should be **allowed** (`Δl=-1`, `Δm=0`).\n    *   `|3,0,0> -> |2,0,0>` should be **disallowed** (`Δl=0`).\n    *   `|3,2,2> -> |2,1,0>` should be **disallowed** (`Δm=-2`).\n\n2.  **Isotropic Decay Test:** The initial state `|3,0,0>` is an s-state (`l=0`), which is spherically symmetric. Therefore, it has no preferred direction of decay. The decay must be isotropic, meaning the transition probability to each of the possible intermediate `m'` states (`|2,1,-1>`, `|2,1,0>`, `|2,1,1>`) must be equal. Since there are three such states, the probability (branching ratio) for any single one must be 1/3.\n\n3.  **Full Path Test:** The solution must identify the option where the entire two-step path is valid according to the selection rules and the associated probability matches the calculated branching ratio.\n    *   Path `|3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>` with probability `1/3` should be identified as **correct**.\n    *   The same path with probability `2/3` should be identified as **incorrect**.\n    *   A valid path like `|3,0,0> -> |2,1,1> -> |1,0,0>` with an incorrect probability like `1/4` should be identified as **incorrect**.\n\nHere is the Python block that implements the solution and the tests.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_h_atom_transition(options):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a two-step dipole transition in the H-atom to find the correct path and probability.\n\n    The core logic relies on two physical principles:\n    1.

    "The user has confirmed that the previous answer was correct. The task is now complete.\n\nFinal Answer: The correct transition route and probability are given by option C.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are `Δl = ±1` and `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n    *   **Step 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩**:\n        *   `l=0`, so `l'` must be `1` (`Δl = +1`).\n        *   `m=0`, so `m'` can be `-1, 0, 1` (`Δm = -1, 0, +1`).\n        *   The intermediate state must be of the form `|n',1,m'⟩`. All options correctly identify the intermediate state as `|2,1,m'⟩`, which is a valid decay channel.\n    *   **Step 2: |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**:\n        *   `l=1`, so `l'` must be `0` (`Δl = -1`).\n        *   `m=0`, so `m'` must be `-1, 0, 1` for the transition to be allowed.\n        *   All paths listed in the options (`|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩`, `|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`, `|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩`) are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n2.  **Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    *   The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Therefore, when it decays, it must decay with equal probability to each of the available final states in the `l=1` manifold.\n    *   The `l=1` (p-subshell) has three possible magnetic quantum states: `m' = -1, 0, +1`.\n    *   The probability is distributed equally among these three states. The probability of the first step being a transition to any *single one* of these states (e.g., `|2,1,0⟩`) is therefore `1/3`.\n    *   The second step, from a specific 2p state like `|2,1,0⟩` to the ground state `|1,0,0⟩`, is the only allowed decay path for that state. Thus, its probability is 1.\n    *   The total probability for the specific route `|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩` is the product of the probabilities of each step: `P_total = P_step1 * P_step2 = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, option C provides the correct path and the correct probability.\n\n<<<C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$>>>"
