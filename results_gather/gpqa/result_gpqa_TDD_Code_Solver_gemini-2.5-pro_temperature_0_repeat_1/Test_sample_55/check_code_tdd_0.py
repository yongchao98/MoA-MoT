    This function verifies the correct answer for a two-step dipole transition
    in a Hydrogen atom from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>.

    It checks two main physics principles:
    1.  Dipole Selection Rules: A transition |n,l,m> -> |n',l',m'> is allowed only if
        Δl = l' - l = ±1 and Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1.
    2.  Isotropic Decay Probability: The initial state |3,0,0> is an s-state (l=0),
        which is spherically symmetric. Its decay to the p-states (l'=1) is isotropic,
        meaning the probability is distributed equally among the possible m' states
        (m' = -1, 0, 1). Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any single
        m' state is 1/3.
