    # --- Step 1: Retrosynthesis to determine the required precursor structure ---

    # Constraint 1: Ring Size
    # The product is a cyclohexene (a 6-membered ring).
    # RCM that forms a 6-membered ring and expels a small molecule like ethene
    # requires a 1,7-diene as the starting material.
    # Let's check which options satisfy this structural requirement.
    # - A: octa-2,6-diene -> forms a 4-membered ring (cyclobutene derivative). Incorrect.
    # - C: octa-1,6-diene -> forms a 5-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative). Incorrect.
    # - B and D are both octa-1,7-dienes, so they are the only structural possibilities.

    # Constraint 2: Substituent Positions
    # In an RCM reaction forming a cyclohexene from an octa-1,7-diene, the substituents on the
    # diene's chain (carbons 3, 4, 5, 6) directly map to the same positions on the resulting ring.
    # The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.
    # This means the substituents on the ring are:
    # - methyl at C3
    # - methyl at C4
    # - isopropyl at C5
    # Therefore, the precursor octa-1,7-diene must have these same substituents
    # at the same positions on its carbon chain.
    required_precursor_structure = {
        "chain": "octa-1,7-diene",
        "substituents": {3: "methyl", 4: "methyl", 5: "isopropyl"}
    }

    # --- Step 2: Determine the correct IUPAC name for the required structure ---

    # The structure has substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5.
    # We must check if numbering from the other end of the chain gives a lower locant set.
    # Chain: C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C7=C8
    # Numbering from left: locants are (3, 4, 5).
    # Numbering from right would place the substituents at positions 4, 5, and 6.
    # The set (3, 4, 5) is lower than (4, 5, 6), so the numbering from the left is correct.

    # Now, list substituents alphabetically to form the name.
    # 'isopropyl' comes before 'methyl'.
    # Correct name: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

        return f"Incorrect. The LLM's answer {llm_answer_key} ('{options[llm_answer_key]}') does not match the derived correct starting material name '{correct_precursor_name}'."

    # Verify that the chosen answer (B) is indeed the correct one.
    if options["B"] != correct_precursor_name:
        return f"Logic Error: Option B should be the correct answer but does not match the derived name."

    # Verify why other options are incorrect.
    # A and C form the wrong ring size.
    # D: "4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene"
    # This name uses the locant set (4, 5, 6), which is incorrect because a lower set (3, 4, 5) exists.
    # Therefore, option D describes the correct molecule but uses an incorrect IUPAC name.
    # Option B provides both the correct structure and the correct IUPAC name.
