    # methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate
    # Key features deduced from the name and reaction mechanism:
    # 1. Must be formed from an intramolecular reaction.
    # 2. The methyl carboxylate (-COOMe) is on C1 and the propyl group is on C2.
    # 3. The new double bond is adjacent to the propyl-bearing carbon (C2).
    #    This gives the connectivity: (MeOOC)-C1 -- C2(Propyl) -- C3=C4...
