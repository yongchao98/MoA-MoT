    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the Feynman diagram question.

    The core physics principle used for verification is:
    In quantum field theory calculations (specifically using dimensional regularization
    in 4D spacetime), each loop in a Feynman diagram typically contributes a factor of
    1/(4pi)^2 to the final expression for the amplitude.

    Therefore, if the expression contains a term 1/(4pi)^P, the number of loops (L)
    can be determined by the formula: L = P / 2.
