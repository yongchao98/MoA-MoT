  "question": "Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW.

    "Here are the small, explicit tests the solution will satisfy:\n\n1.  **`test_star1`**: A star with declination -75 degrees. Expected: `False`, as it's too far south for the Keck Observatory.\n2.  **`test_star2`**: A star with an apparent magnitude of 16.5. Expected: `False`, as it's too faint for the HIRES spectrograph (limit V < 16).\n3.  **`test_star3`**: A star with an apparent magnitude of 15.5 and declination of 48 degrees. Expected: `True`, as it meets both magnitude and location criteria.\n4.  **`test_star4`**: A star whose calculated apparent magnitude is 16.74. Expected: `False`, as it's too faint for HIRES.\n5.  **`test_star5`**: A star whose calculated apparent magnitude is ~15.0 and declination is 60 degrees. Expected: `True`, as it meets both criteria.\n6.  **`test_dec_fail_north`**: A star at declination +66 degrees. Expected: `False`, as it's too far north for the Paranal Observatory.\n7.  **`test_mag_fail_edge`**: A star with an apparent magnitude of exactly 16.0. Expected: `False`, as it must be *brighter than* 16.\n8.  **`test_pass_all_conditions`**: A bright star at the celestial equator (V=10, DEC=0). Expected: `True`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_star_visibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function encapsulates the entire logic for determining which stars are\n    observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, running tests, and returning the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Solution Function ---\n    def can_be_observed(dec, v_app=None, mv_abs=None, dist_pc=None, ebv=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Determines if a single star is observable by both observatories.\n\n        Args:\n            dec (float): Declination of the star in degrees.\n            v_app (float, optional): Apparent V magnitude.

    "Excellent! The tests passed, and the logic correctly identified that Star3 and Star5 are the only ones observable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star3:** Its apparent magnitude (15.5) is brighter than the HIRES limit of 16, and its declination (+48°) is visible from both the Northern (Keck) and Southern (Paranal) hemispheres.\n*   **Star5:** Its calculated apparent magnitude is approximately 15.0, which is brighter than 16. Its declination (+60°) is also within the observable range for both observatories.\n\nAll other stars fail on at least one of the criteria (either being too faint for HIRES or having a declination outside the overlapping visibility zone).\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
