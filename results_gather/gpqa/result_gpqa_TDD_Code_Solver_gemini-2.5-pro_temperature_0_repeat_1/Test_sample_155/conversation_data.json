    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution:\n\n1.  **Test Reaction 1 Product:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene via epoxidation and acid-catalyzed opening (*anti*-dihydroxylation) should yield a single meso product, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n2.  **Test Reaction 2 Products:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene via the same sequence should yield a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Test Standard HPLC:** An achiral HPLC analysis of a mixture containing a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers should result in 2 peaks, as the enantiomers are not resolved but are separated from their diastereomer (the meso compound).\n4.  **Test Chiral HPLC:** A chiral HPLC analysis of the same mixture should result in 3 peaks, as all three unique stereoisomers (the meso compound and the two separate enantiomers) are resolved.\n5.  **Test Final Answer:** The overall logic should conclude that the chemist observes 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC, which corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the chemical reactions and chromatographic analysis\n    to determine the number of peaks observed in standard and chiral HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the products of each reaction based on stereochemistry.\n    # The reaction sequence (mCPBA, then H3O+) results in anti-dihydroxylation.\n    \n    # Reaction 1: (E)-alkene (trans) + anti-addition -> meso product.\n    # This produces a single, achiral compound with two chiral centers.\n    products_reaction1 = {\"meso-octane-4,5-diol\"}\n\n    # Reaction 2: (Z)-alkene (cis) + anti-addition -> racemic mixture.\n    # This produces a 50/50 mixture of two enantiomers.\n    products_reaction2 = {\"(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\", \"(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\"}\n\n    # Step 2: Combine the products from both reactions.\n    # The mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    # -

    "Excellent! The logic was confirmed by the tests. The solution correctly identifies the products based on the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction mechanism. It then correctly applies the principles of chromatography:\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** Separates diastereomers (the meso compound from the enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** Separates all unique stereoisomers (the meso compound and both individual enantiomers).\n\nI'm glad the answer was correct. Please provide the next question when you are ready."
