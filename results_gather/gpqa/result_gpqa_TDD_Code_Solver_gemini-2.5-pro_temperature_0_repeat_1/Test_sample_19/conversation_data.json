    "Here are the tests for the impulse approximation problem.\n\n1.  **`test_correct_assumptions`**: The solution must identify the combination of assumptions (1, 2, and 4) as the correct set, which corresponds to option 'A'. The impulse approximation requires treating the interaction as occurring with a single nucleon (1), which is then ejected without further interaction (2), and the interaction itself is so rapid that binding forces are negligible during the event (4).\n2.  **`test_excludes_internal_structure_assumption`**: The solution must exclude assumption 3. The internal quark structure of a nucleon (relativistic or not) is a separate physical consideration from how the nucleon as a whole interacts within the nucleus. Options B, C, and D incorrectly include this assumption.\n3.  **`test_includes_one_body_current_assumption`**: The solution must include assumption 1. The core idea of the approximation is to reduce a many-body problem to a one-body problem, so the interaction must be with an individual nucleon.

    "The user's feedback indicates a `SyntaxError` in the checking environment, specifically an \"unterminated triple-quoted string literal\". This error arises because the checking script wraps the entire model output in triple quotes (`\"\"\"...\"\"\"`), and the docstrings (`\"\"\"...\"\"\"`) within the Python code prematurely close the wrapper string, leading to a syntax error.\n\nTo resolve this, I will replace all multi-line docstrings in the Python code with block comments using the `#` symbol.
