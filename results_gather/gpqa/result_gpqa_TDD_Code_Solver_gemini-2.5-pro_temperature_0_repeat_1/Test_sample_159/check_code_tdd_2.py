    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM's answer.

    The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima for Fraunhofer
    diffraction from an N-sided polygon with constant apothem 'a' as N -> infinity.

    The LLM's reasoning is as follows:
    1. As N -> infinity, the N-sided polygon with constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a'. This is correct.
    2. The problem is therefore equivalent to Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This is the correct physical model.
    3. The angular positions of the minima (θ_m) are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function (J1).
       The formula is k * a * sin(θ) = z_m, where k = 2π/λ and z_m are the zeros of J1.
    4. Using the small angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), this becomes θ_m = z_m * λ / (2 * π * a). This formula is correct.
    5. The angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (z_2 - z_1) * λ / (2 * π * a). This is also correct.
    6. The final step is to calculate the coefficient C = (z_2 - z_1) / (2 * π) and select the closest option.

    This code will verify the numerical calculation and the choice of the closest option.
