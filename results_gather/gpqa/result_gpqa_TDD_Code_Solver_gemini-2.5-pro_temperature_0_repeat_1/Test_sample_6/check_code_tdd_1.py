    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # The threshold energy (E_gamma) for the process gamma + gamma_CMB -> e+ + e-
    # is derived from the invariance of the four-momentum squared (s).
    # In the lab frame (for a head-on collision): s = 4 * E_gamma * E_CMB
    # In the center-of-momentum frame (at threshold): s = (2 * m_e * c^2)^2
    # Equating the two gives: 4 * E_gamma * E_CMB = 4 * (m_e * c^2)^2
    # Solving for E_gamma: E_gamma = (m_e * c^2)^2 / E_CMB

    # Calculate the threshold energy in eV.
    E_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV

    # Convert the result to GeV.

    option_A_value_GeV = 2.6 * 1e5

    # Check if the calculated value is close to the value from option A.
    # A relative tolerance of 1% is used to account for rounding in the option.
