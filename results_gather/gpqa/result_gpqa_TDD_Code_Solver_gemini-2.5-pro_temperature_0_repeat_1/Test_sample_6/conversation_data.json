    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution:\n1.  **Typical Case (Problem's values):** For an electron-positron pair production ($m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511$ MeV) from a CMB photon ($E_{CMB} = 10^{-3}$ eV), the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray should be approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n2.  **Sanity Check (Higher Target Energy):** If the target photon were more energetic (e.g., 1 eV instead of $10^{-3}$ eV), the required gamma-ray energy should be significantly lower.\n3.  **Sanity Check (Heavier Product Particle):** If the process produced a heavier pair like a muon-antimuon ($m_\\mu c^2 \\approx 105.7$ MeV), the required gamma-ray energy should be significantly higher.\n4.  **Edge Case (Zero Energy Target):** If the target photon had zero energy, the required gamma-ray energy would be infinite.

    "An observer on Earth is in a reference frame (the \"lab frame\") where the CMB is approximately isotropic. The process is the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a CMB photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$):\n$$ \\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^- $$\nTo find the minimum (threshold) energy for the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$, we must consider the kinematics of the collision. The threshold energy is minimized when the collision is head-on.\n\nWe use the conservation of four-momentum. The square of the total four-momentum (the Mandelstam variable $s$) is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames.\n\nIn the lab frame, for a head-on collision ($\\theta = \\pi$), the invariant mass squared is:\n$$ s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = (E_\\gamma + E_{CMB})^2 - (\\vec{p}_\\gamma + \\vec{p}_{CMB})^2 $$\nSince photons are massless, $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$. For a head-on collision, the momenta are in opposite directions.\n$$ s = (E_\\gamma + E_{CMB})^2 - (E_\\gamma - E_{CMB})^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB} $$\n(Here, we are using units where $c=1$).\n\nAt the threshold, the final products (electron and positron) are created at rest in the center-of-momentum frame. In this frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the electron and positron, which is $2m_e c^2$. The invariant mass squared of the final state is therefore:\n$$ s = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2 $$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $s$:\n$$ 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2 $$\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}} $$\n\nNow, we plug in the known values:\n- Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n- Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV} $$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
