    The user has pointed out a factual error in the molecular formula calculation for option B in the previous attempt. This requires a re-evaluation of the problem with the corrected information. The TDD process is ideal for catching and correcting such errors.

    **1. List of Tests**

    *   **Test 1: Product Structure Analysis.** The interpretation of the NMR spectra must correctly identify the key structural fragments of the product. The product must contain a ketone, a para-disubstituted aromatic ring, and two distinct methyl groups, one of which is part of the para-substitution and the other part of an acetyl group. This points to 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.
    *   **Test 2: Molecular Formula Validation (Corrected).** The code must filter the potential starting materials (options A-D) to only include those that match the given molecular formula for Compound X, C11H12O. This test will be updated with the correct formula for option B.
    *   **Test 3: Reaction Plausibility Check.** The code must compare the structural features of the valid starting materials (from Test 2) with the deduced product structure. Since the reaction is an isomerization, the starting material must contain the same core carbon skeleton and substituent pattern as the product. Specifically, the product contains a `p-tolyl` (4-methylphenyl) group, so the correct starting material must also possess this feature.
