    # - ¹³C at 197.7 ppm -> Ketone C=O
    # - ¹H signals at 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d) -> para-disubstituted benzene ring.
    # - ¹H signals at 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s) -> Two distinct methyl groups.
    # The combination of a para-ring and a methyl group points to a p-tolyl (4-methylphenyl) group.
