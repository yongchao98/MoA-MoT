    "An analysis of the problem leads to the following deductions:\n\n1.  **Product Structure from NMR:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl (C=O).\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   The signals at δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d) indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The signal at δ 2.31 (3H, s) is a methyl group singlet, likely attached to the benzene ring (a tolyl group), consistent with the para-substitution pattern.\n        *   The signal at δ 2.28 (3H, s) is another methyl group singlet, likely part of an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃), consistent with the ketone.\n        *   The signals at δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d) are a pair of coupled vinylic protons (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives the product structure as **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. This molecule contains a *p-tolyl* group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   The reaction is conducted with a base (DABCO) and heat. This suggests an isomerization or rearrangement reaction. No atoms are added or removed.\n    *   Since the product contains a *p-tolyl* group (a methyl group on the phenyl ring), the starting material (Compound X) must also contain this same structural feature. The reaction conditions are not capable of adding a methyl group to a benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   The molecular formula of Compound X is C₁₁H₁₂O. We check the options:\n        *   A) 2-styrylepoxide (C₁₀H₁₀O) - Incorrect formula.\n        *   B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O) - Correct formula, but has a *phenyl* group, not a *p-tolyl* group.\n        *   C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O) - Correct formula, but has a *phenyl* group (from \"styryl\"), not a *p-tolyl* group.\n        *   D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (C₁₁H₁₂O) - Correct formula. The name \"4-methylstyryl\" explicitly indicates the presence of the required *p-tolyl* group.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Only option D has the necessary p-tolyl group that is conserved in the product. The reaction is a known base-catalyzed isomerization of a vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Therefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
