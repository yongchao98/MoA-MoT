    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by verifying each step of the chemical deduction.
    
    The deduction process involves:
    1. Identifying the product from the given NMR spectra.
    2. Checking which of the potential starting materials (Compound X options) have the correct molecular formula (C11H12O).
    3. Determining which of the valid starting materials could plausibly rearrange to form the identified product under the given reaction conditions.

    # Step 1: Verify the deduced product structure against NMR data.
    # The NMR data strongly suggests a specific structure. Let's check if the LLM's product matches the key features.
    # 13C at 197.7 ppm -> Ketone (C=O). The product name "-one" matches.
    # 1H: two 3H singlets -> Two isolated methyl groups. The product has an acetyl-CH3 and a tolyl-CH3. This matches.
    # 1H: two 2H doublets in aromatic region -> para-substituted benzene ring. The product has a "4-methylphenyl" group. This matches.
    # 1H: two 1H doublets -> A -CH=CH- group. The product has a "but-3-en" structure. This matches.
    # The product formula C11H12O is also consistent with an isomerization of the starting material.

    # Step 3: Check for reaction plausibility.
    # The reaction is an isomerization. It rearranges atoms but does not add or remove them.
