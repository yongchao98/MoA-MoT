    "Here is the final answer.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction A:** The starting material `A` is treated with Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`). `LiBH4` is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to alcohols but does not react with carboxylic acids. The resulting hydroxy acid then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) under acidic conditions (`H+`) to form the product.\n2.  **Reaction B:** The starting material `B` is treated with Borane (`BH3`). `BH3` is a selective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols but does not react with esters. The resulting hydroxy ester then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (transesterification) under acidic conditions (`H+`) to form the product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** In both reaction pathways, the reactions (reduction and cyclization) occur at the functional groups (carboxyl and ester) and do not affect the chiral center at the 3-position (the carbon with the ethyl group). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the chiral center is retained from the starting material to the final product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For Reaction A, to produce `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material `A` must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   For Reaction B, to produce `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material `B` must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n*   A) A = (R), B = (R)\n*   B) A = (S), B = (R)\n*   **C) A = (R), B = (S)**\n*   D) A = (S), B = (S)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
