    # --- Step 1: Define the physics principles ---
    # The mean free path (MFP) of a particle in a gas is given by λ = 1 / (n * σ),
    # where n is the number density of target particles and σ is the collision cross-section.
    # A factor of sqrt(2) is introduced for the MFP of a gas particle moving among
    # identical, moving particles to account for their relative velocities.

    # For λ1 (gas-gas collision):
    # The moving particle and target particles are identical gas molecules. The kinetic theory
    # formula λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) applies.
    # The gas-gas collision cross-section, σ_gg, is π * d^2, where d is the molecular diameter.
    # So, λ1 is proportional to 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * π * d^2).

    # For λ2 (electron-gas collision):
    # The moving particle is a high-speed electron, whose size is negligible. The target gas
    # molecules can be considered stationary in comparison. Thus, the sqrt(2) factor does not apply.
    # The electron-gas collision cross-section, σ_eg, is determined by the radius of the
    # gas molecule (r = d/2). So, σ_eg = π * r^2 = π * (d/2)^2 = (π * d^2) / 4.
    # So, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (π * d^2) / 4).

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the theoretical ratio λ2 / λ1 ---
    # The ratio is λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]
    # λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)
    # The number density 'n' cancels out.
    # λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)
    # Substituting the expressions for σ:
    # λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (π * d^2) / ((π * d^2) / 4)
    # λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * 4
