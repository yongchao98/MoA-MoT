    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the solution:\n\n1.  **Test with Simple Hard-Sphere Model:** In a simple model where collision cross-section `σ` is `πr²`, the effective radius for a gas-gas collision is `2r_gas`, while for an electron-gas collision it's `r_gas` (electron radius is negligible). Since mean free path `λ` is inversely proportional to `σ`, the ratio `λ2/λ1` should be `(π(2r_gas)²)/(π(r_gas)²) = 4`. The test will verify `λ2/λ1 = 4`.\n2.  **Test with Kinetic Theory Model:** A more accurate model for gas-gas collisions introduces a `sqrt(2)` factor. The mean free path for gas-gas collisions is `λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * π * d²)`, where `d` is the molecular diameter. For electron-gas collisions, `λ2 = 1 / (n * π * r²) = 1 / (n * π * (d/2)²)`. The ratio `λ2/λ1` should be `4 * sqrt(2) ≈ 5.657`. The test will verify this result.\n3.  **Test Conclusion against Option A:** Based on the models, the calculated ratio `λ2/λ1` (which is 4 or ~5.657) must be greater than or equal to 1.22. This test checks if `λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1`.\n4.  **Test Conclusion against Other Options:** The ratio `λ2/λ1` must be greater than 1, which invalidates options B (`λ2 < λ1`) and C (`λ2 = λ1`). This test will confirm the ratio is not less than or equal to 1.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_microscope_mfp():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the relationship between the mean free path (MFP) of gas-gas\n    collisions (λ1) and electron-gas collisions (λ2).\n\n    The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section σ:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is the number density of target particles.\n\n    1.  For λ1 (gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules):\n        The collision involves two particles of significant size (radius r_gas).\n        The effective collision cross-section, σ1, is determined by the sum of\n        their radii. In a simple hard-sphere model, σ1 is proportional to π*(r_gas + r_gas)² = 4π*r_gas².\n        A more accurate formula from kinetic theory for identical particles is\n        λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * π * d²), where d is the molecular diameter (2*r_gas).\n\n    2.  For λ2 (electron colliding with a gas molecule):\n        The collision involves a point-like particle (electron) and a gas molecule.\n        The effective collision cross-section, σ2, is determined primarily by the\n        size of the gas molecule. So, σ2 is proportional to π*r_gas².\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2).\n\n    Comparison:\n    Since the number density 'n' is the same in both scenarios, the ratio of the\n    mean free paths is the inverse of the ratio of their cross-sections:\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2.\n\n    From the simple model, σ1 is roughly 4 times σ2. Therefore, λ2 is roughly 4 times λ1.\n    From the kinetic theory model, the ratio is even larger, approximately 4*sqrt(2) ≈ 5.66.\n\n    Conclusion: In all valid physical models, the cross-section for gas-gas\n    collisions (σ1) is significantly larger than for electron-gas collisions (σ2).\n    This means the mean free path for an electron (λ2) must be significantly\n    larger than the mean free path for a gas molecule (λ1).\n    Therefore, λ2 > λ1.
