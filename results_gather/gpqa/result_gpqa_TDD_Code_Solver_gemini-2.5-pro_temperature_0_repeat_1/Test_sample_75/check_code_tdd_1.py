    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by modeling the biological experiment's logic.

    The function simulates the key events and their dependencies:
    1. iPSCs are injected.
    2. They must differentiate to activate the lineage-specific promoter.
    3. Differentiation leads to a red signal (mRaspberry).
    4. Differentiated cells must integrate into the embryo.
    5. Failure to integrate is a common outcome and leads to apoptosis.
    6. Apoptosis is marked by a green signal (TUNEL-FITC).
    7. The question asks for the *first significant observation* about the injected cells' fate.
