    # Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.
    # Reaction: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).
    # The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group.
    # Due to less steric hindrance, the para-substituted product is the major isomer.
    # Conclusion for Step 1: Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene.
    product_1 = "p-nitrotoluene"

    # Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.
    # Reaction: Oxidation.
    # MnO2 in acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent that converts the benzylic
    # methyl group (-CH3) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
    # Conclusion for Step 2: Product 2 is p-nitrobenzoic acid.
    product_2 = "p-nitrobenzoic acid"

    # Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.
    # Reaction: Acid-Base Reaction.
    # The primary reaction is the deprotonation of the acidic carboxylic acid (Product 2)
    # by the strong base (NaOH). The acetone serves as a solvent and is a distractor.
    # The final product is the conjugate base of p-nitrobenzoic acid.
    # Conclusion for Step 3: Product 3 is the p-nitrobenzoate anion.
    product_3 = "p-nitrobenzoate anion"

    # Final Analysis: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.
    # Molecule: p-nitrobenzoate anion ([O2N-C6H4-COO]-).
    # The molecule is planar. The two oxygens on the carboxylate group are equivalent
    # due to resonance, as are the two oxygens on the nitro group.
    # Symmetry Elements:
    # - A principal C2 axis passes through the nitro group, C1, C4, and the carboxylate group.
    # - Two perpendicular C2 axes exist in the plane of the molecule and perpendicular to it.
    # - A center of inversion (i) is at the center of the benzene ring.
    # - Three perpendicular mirror planes (σ) exist.
    # This combination of symmetry elements (E, 3x C2, i, 3x σ) defines the D2h point group.
