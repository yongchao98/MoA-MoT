    "TDD is a software development practice. For this chemistry problem, I will simulate the TDD process by first defining the expected outcomes of each reaction step as tests. The \"code\" will then be the chemical reasoning to satisfy these tests.\n\n### Step 1: Tests\n\n1.  **Test for Reaction 1 (Nitration):**\n    *   **Input:** Toluene\n    *   **Reagents:** Nitric acid and sulfuric acid\n    *   **Expected Output (Product 1):** 4-nitrotoluene (the major para-isomer).\n\n2.  **Test for Reaction 2 (Oxidation):**\n    *   **Input:** 4-nitrotoluene\n    *   **Reagents:** MnO₂ and H₂SO₄\n    *   **Expected Output (Product 2):** 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. This is a crucial interpretation. While oxidation to carboxylic acid is common, the subsequent reaction (Step 3) is a classic Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which requires an aldehyde. This implies a controlled oxidation to the aldehyde.\n\n3.  **Test for Reaction 3 (Condensation):**\n    *   **Input:** 4-nitrobenzaldehyde\n    *   **Reagents:** Acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide\n    *   **Expected Output (Product 3):** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is the dehydrated product of the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, with the more stable trans (E) configuration.\n\n4.  **Test for Final Symmetry:**\n    *   **Input:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n    *   **Expected Point Group:** Cₛ. The molecule has a plane of symmetry containing the aromatic ring and the conjugated enone system, but no other symmetry elements like a center of inversion or a rotational axis.\n\n### Step 2: Python Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Solution Implementation\n\ndef step_1_nitration(reactant):\n    \"\"\"Simulates the nitration of toluene.\"\"\"\n    if reactant == \"toluene\":\n        # Nitration of toluene gives ortho and para products.\n        # The para product is major and carried forward.\n        return \"4-nitrotoluene\"\n    return None\n\ndef step_2_oxidation(reactant):\n    \"\"\"Simulates the oxidation of the methyl group.\"\"\"\n    if reactant == \"4-nitrotoluene\":\n        # MnO2/H2SO4 oxidizes the benzylic methyl group.
