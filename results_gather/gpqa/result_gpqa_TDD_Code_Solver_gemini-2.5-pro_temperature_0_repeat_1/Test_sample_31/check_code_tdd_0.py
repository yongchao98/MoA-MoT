    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the total relativistic energy of a specific Lithium nucleus
    moving at a given speed.

    The correctness check involves:
    1.  Identifying the parameters from the question (nucleus composition, speed).
    2.  Performing the relativistic energy calculation (E = γ * m₀c²).
    3.  Deducing the implicit assumption about the nucleus's rest mass, which is a common
        step in solving multiple-choice physics problems.
    4.  Comparing the calculated result with the provided answer (Option D) within the
        specified precision.
