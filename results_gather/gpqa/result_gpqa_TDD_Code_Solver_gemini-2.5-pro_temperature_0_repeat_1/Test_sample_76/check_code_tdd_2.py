    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the two-part chemistry question.

    The function validates the answer based on two key chemical principles:
    1.  Reaction A is a Wittig rearrangement, and its product must match the expected structure based on the provided options.
    2.  Reaction B is a thermal Cope rearrangement, which is an isomerization. Therefore, the degree of saturation ("hexahydro") must be conserved from reactant to product.
