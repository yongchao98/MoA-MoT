    Checks the correctness of the given answer for a chemistry rearrangement problem.

    The verification is based on two principles derived from the problem description
    and chemical knowledge, as outlined in the provided solution:
    1. Reaction A is a [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement, yielding '4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol'.
    2. Reaction B is a thermal isomerization (Cope rearrangement), meaning the 'hexahydro'
       saturation level of the starting material must be conserved in the product.
