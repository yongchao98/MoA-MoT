def check_correctness():

    Checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer.

    The problem involves relativistic particle decay. The survival fraction 'f'
    of a particle after traveling a distance 'R' is given by:
    f = exp(-R / (c * gamma * tau_0))
    where:
    - R is the distance traveled (detector radius)
    - c is the speed of light
    - gamma is the Lorentz factor
    - tau_0 is the proper mean lifetime of the particle

    From this equation, we can derive ln(f) = -R / (c * gamma * tau_0).
    Rearranging gives: gamma * ln(f) = -R / (c * tau_0).
    Since R, c, and tau_0 are constants for the experiment, the product
    gamma * ln(f) must be constant.

    Therefore, for two scenarios (1 and 2):
    gamma_1 * ln(f_1) = gamma_2 * ln(f_2)

    This allows us to solve for the unknown Lorentz factor, gamma_2:
    gamma_2 = gamma_1 * (ln(f_1) / ln(f_2))
