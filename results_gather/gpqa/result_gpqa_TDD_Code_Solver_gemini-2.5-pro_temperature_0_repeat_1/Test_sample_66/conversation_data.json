    "Here are the small, explicit tests the solution should satisfy, based on the principles of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Test 1 (The User's Question):** For two p-orbital electrons ($l_1=1, l_2=1$) in the coupled state $|l=2, m=-1>$, the probability of measuring $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ should be 0. This is because the sum of the measured z-components ($m_1+m_2 = -2$) must equal the total z-component of the state ($m=-1$), which is not the case here.\n2.  **Test 2 (A Possible Outcome):** For the same state $|l=2, m=-1>$, the probability of measuring $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=0$ should be 1/2. Here, $m_1+m_2 = m$, and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1>$ is $\\sqrt{1/2}$. The probability is $(\\sqrt{1/2})^2 = 1/2$.\n3.  **Test 3 (A Different Coupled State):** For the state $|l=1, m=0>$, the probability of measuring $m_1=1$ and $m_2=-1$ should be 1/2. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, 1; 1, -1 | 1, 0>$ is $\\sqrt{1/2}$, so the probability is $(\\sqrt{1/2})^2 = 1/2$.\n4.  **Test 4 (A \"Stretched\" State):** For the state $|l=2, m=2>$, the only possible uncoupled state is $|m_1=1, m_2=1>$. Therefore, the probability of measuring $m_1=1$ and $m_2=1$ must be 1.\n5.  **Test 5 (A Zero-Valued Coefficient):** For the state $|l=1, m=0>$, the probability of measuring $m_1=0$ and $m_2=0$ should be 0. Although $m_1+m_2=m$, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, 0; 1, 0 | 1, 0>$ is 0.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_joint_probability(l, m, m1_target, m2_target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the joint probability of measuring m1_target and m2_target\n    for a 2-electron system with l1=1, l2=1 in a coupled state |l, m>.\n\n    The probability is the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    We use a pre-computed table for the coefficients for coupling l1=1 and l2=1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sum of individual z-components must equal the total z-component.\n    # If not, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero by definition.\n    if m1_target + m2_target != m:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1.\n    # Key: (l, m, m1, m2), Value: coefficient\n    # Source: Standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficient tables.\n    cg_table = {\n        # l=2\n        (2, 2, 1, 1): 1.0,\n        (2, 1, 1, 0): math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (2, 1, 0, 1): math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (2, 0, 1, -1): math.sqrt(1/6),\n        (2, 0, 0, 0): math.sqrt(2/3),\n        (2, 0, -1, 1): math.sqrt(1/6),\n        (2, -1, 0, -1): math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (2, -1, -1, 0): math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (2, -2, -1, -1): 1.0,\n        # l=1\n        (1, 1, 1, 0): math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (1, 1, 0, 1): -math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (1, 0, 1, -1): math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (1, 0, -1, 1): -math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (1, -1, 0, -1): math.sqrt(1/2),\n        (1, -1, -1, 0): -math.sqrt(1/2),\n        # l=0\n        (0, 0, 1, -1): math.sqrt(1/3),\n        (0, 0, 0, 0): -math.sqrt(1/3),\n        (0, 0, -1, 1): math.sqrt(1/3),\n    }\n\n    key = (l, m, m1_target, m2_target)\n    coefficient = cg_table.get(key, 0.0)\n    \n    # Probability is the square of the coefficient's magnitude.\n    probability = coefficient**2\n    return probability\n\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"Runs all defined tests.\"\"\"\n    tests = [\n        # Test 1: The user's question\n        {\"l\": 2, \"m\": -1, \"m1\": -1, \"m2\": -1, \"expected\": 0.0, \"name\": \"User's Question\"},\n        # Test 2: A possible outcome\n        {\"l\": 2, \"m\": -1, \"m1\": -1, \"m2\": 0, \"expected\": 0.5, \"name\": \"Possible Outcome\"},\n        # Test 3: A different coupled state\n        {\"l\": 1, \"m\": 0, \"m1\": 1, \"m2\": -1, \"expected\": 0.5, \"name\": \"Different State\"},\n        # Test 4: A \"stretched\" state\n        {\"l\": 2, \"m\": 2, \"m1\": 1, \"m2\": 1, \"expected\": 1.0, \"name\": \"Stretched State\"},\n        # Test 5: A zero-valued coefficient\n        {\"l\": 1, \"m\": 0, \"m1\": 0, \"m2\": 0, \"expected\": 0.0, \"name\": \"Zero Coefficient\"},\n    ]\n\n    for i, test in enumerate(tests):\n        result = calculate_joint_probability(test[\"l\"], test[\"m\"], test[\"m1\"], test[\"m2\"])\n        if not math.isclose(result, test[\"expected\"], rel_tol=1e-9):\n            print(f\"--- Test Failed: {test['name']} ---\")\n            print(f\"Input: l={test['l']}, m={test['m']}, m1={test['m1']}, m2={test['m2']}\")\n            print(f\"Expected: {test['expected']}, Got: {result}\")\n            return False\n            \n    return True\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if run_tests():\n        # Calculate the final answer for the user's question\n        final_answer_prob = calculate_joint_probability(l=2, m=-1, m1_target=-1, m2_target=-1)\n        \n        # Determine which option (A, B, C, D) corresponds to the answer\n        options = {'A': 0, 'B': 2/3, 'C': 1, 'D': 1/2}\n        final_answer_letter = None\n        for letter, value in options.items():\n            if math.isclose(final_answer_prob, value):\n                final_answer_letter = letter\n                break\n        \n        print(f\"All tests passed\")\n        print(f\"The final answer is {final_answer_prob}, which corresponds to option {final_answer_letter}.\")\n        # The final output format required by the prompt\n        print(f\"<<<{final_answer_letter}>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "Excellent! The TDD process has confirmed the initial analysis. The core principle at play is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The initial state of the two-electron system is a coupled state denoted by `|l, m>`, where `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and `m=-1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n2.  A measurement is made on the individual z-components of angular momentum for each electron, `L_1z` and `L_2z`. The possible outcomes for these measurements are given by the quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2`.\n3.  A fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling is that the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers must equal the total z-component quantum number of the system. That is, `m_1 + m_2 = m`.\n4.  The question asks for the probability of measuring `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n5.  Let's check if this outcome is possible by summing the individual components: `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n6.  This sum (`-2`) does not equal the system's total `m` value, which is `-1`.\n7.  Because `m_1 + m_2 â‰  m`, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` to the measurement outcome `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is zero.\n8.  The probability of a measurement is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient. Therefore, the probability is `0^2 = 0`.\n\nThis outcome is impossible, so the probability is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
