    "The user's request implies my previous answer was correct, as the checker feedback matches my output. The prompt asks to add failing tests if any exist. Since the logic was sound and all initial tests passed, confirming the model against all constraints of the problem, there are no failing tests to add. The solution correctly identifies the salts and calculates the total number of atoms. I will re-affirm the solution.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze Products:** The products are determined from the experimental data:\n    *   Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂): Absorbs H₂O. Mass gain of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.2 mol H₂O**.\n    *   Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂): No mass change means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced. The salts do not contain carbon.\n    *   Tube 3 (hot Cu): Reacts with O₂. Mass gain of 0.80 g is from oxygen atoms. This corresponds to 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol of O atoms, which is **0.025 mol of O₂ gas**.\n    *   Remaining Gas C: 2.24 L at STP is 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol of an inert gas**, which must be N₂.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactants (Salts A and B):** The products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) from heating salts strongly suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The two most common are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Hypothesis: Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n    *   Decomposition A: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Decomposition B: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n3.  **Verify Hypothesis with Stoichiometry:** Let `x` be the moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n    *   Total N₂ produced = `x` (from A) + `x` (from B) = `2x`. Since we have 0.1 mol N₂, `2x = 0.1`, so `x = 0.05` mol.\n    *   The mixture contains 0.05 mol of A and 0.05 mol of B.\n\n4.  **Test the Model:**\n    *   **Test H₂O:** Moles H₂O = `2x` (from A) + `2x` (from B) = `4x` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This matches the experimental value.\n    *   **Test O₂:** Moles O₂ = `0.5x` (from B) = 0.5 * 0.05 = 0.025 mol. This matches the experimental value.\n    *   **Test Total Mass:**\n        *   M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n        *   M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol. Mass = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given total mass.\n\n5.  **Calculate Final Answer:** The hypothesis is confirmed.\n    *   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe code correctly implements this logic and passes all tests.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the salts A and B based on the experimental data\n    and calculates the total number of atoms in their formulas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Deduce products from experimental data ---\n    # Molar masses (g/mol)\n    M_H2O = 18.0\n    M_O = 16.0\n    VOL_MOLAR_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n    # Given data\n    mass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g (H2O)\n    mass_increase_tube3 = 0.80  # g (Oxygen atoms in CuO)\n    volume_gas_C = 2.24  # L (at STP)\n\n    # Calculate moles of products\n    moles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / M_H2O  # 3.60 / 18.0 = 0.2 mol\n    # Mass increase in tube 3 is due to oxygen: 2Cu + O2 -> 2CuO\n    moles_O_atoms = mass_increase_tube3 / M_O  # 0.80 / 16.0 = 0.05 mol\n    moles_O2_gas = moles_O_atoms / 2  # 0.025 mol\n    # Gas C is inert to all reagents, suggesting N2\n    moles_N2_gas = volume_gas_C / VOL_MOLAR_STP  # 2.24 / 22.4 = 0.1 mol\n\n    # --- Step 2: Formulate and test hypothesis for salts A and B ---\n    # The products are H2O, O2, and N2.

    "The problem was solved by identifying the products of the thermal decomposition and using them to deduce the original salts.\n\n1.  **Identify Products:**\n    *   The 3.60 g mass increase in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to 3.60 g of H₂O (0.2 mol).\n    *   The lack of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ solution means no CO₂ was produced.\n    *   The 0.80 g mass increase in the tube with hot copper is due to oxygen atoms reacting to form CuO. This corresponds to 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, or 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n    *   The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP is an inert gas, identified as N₂, which is 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactants (Salts A and B):**\n    *   The products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) strongly suggest the decomposition of ammonium salts.
