    # --- 3. Formulate and test a hypothesis for the salts A and B ---
    # The products (H2O, N2, O2) from heating salts suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.

    # A: NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O
    # B: 2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O  (or per mole: NH4NO3 -> N2 + 2H2O + 0.5 O2)

    # Let 'x' be the number of moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.
    # We can create a system of equations based on the products.

    # Moles H2O = x * (2 from A) + x * (2 from B) = 4x
