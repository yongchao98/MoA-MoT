    # and the ester group. This symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent:

    # (CN, COOEt, and the two different pathways around the ring). This prochirality
    # makes the two protons on each CH2 group of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6)
    # diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and
    # give separate signals in the NMR spectrum.

    # - Protons on C2 and C6: The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (2 signals).

    #   on C2 and C6 give a total of 2 signals.
