    "Here is the solution developed using a Test-Driven Development approach.\n\n### 1. Tests\n\n1.  **Test Product Identification**: The function should correctly identify the final product of the reaction sequence as Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n2.  **Test Ethyl Group Signals**: The function should correctly identify that the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) contributes 2 distinct signals.\n3.  **Test Ring Signals**: The function should correctly identify that the ten protons on the cyclohexane ring contribute 6 distinct signals due to symmetry and diastereotopicity.\n4.  **Test Final Answer**: The function should calculate the total number of signals to be 8.\n5.  **Test Edge Case (Simpler Molecule)**: For a simpler, related molecule like ethyl cyclohexane, which has a plane of symmetry, the number of signals should be 5 (ethyl-CH2, ethyl-CH3, ring-C1-H, ring-C2/6-H, ring-C3/5-H, ring-C4-H). Note: In ethyl cyclohexane, the protons on each CH2 group are diastereotopic, so the count would be higher. A better simple test is cyclopentanone, which has 2 signals due to its C2v symmetry. This test serves as a conceptual check on the symmetry analysis logic.\n\n### 2.

    "An excellent question that combines multi-step organic synthesis with spectroscopic analysis. Let's break it down using Test-Driven Development.\n\n### 1. Tests\n\n1.  **Test Reaction Sequence**: The function must correctly deduce the final product of the four-step synthesis. The final product should be identified as Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n2.  **Test Ethyl Group Signals**: The function should correctly identify that the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) contributes 2 distinct signals (one for the -CH₂- and one for the -CH₃).\n3.  **Test Cyclohexane Ring Signals**: The function must analyze the symmetry of the cyclohexane ring. Due to a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4, the protons on C2/C6 are equivalent, and C3/C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on *each* methylene group (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. This results in 2 signals from C2/C6, 2 from C3/C5, and 2 from C4, for a total of 6 signals from the ring.\n4.  **Test Total Signal Count**: The function should sum the signals from the ethyl group (2) and the ring (6) to arrive at a total of 8 signals.\n5.  **Test Simpler Case (Conceptual)**: For 1,1-dimethylcyclohexane, which also has a C1-C4 plane of symmetry, the logic should yield 7 signals (1 for the two equivalent methyl groups, and 2+2+2=6 for the diastereotopic ring protons).

    "An excellent job on this multi-step problem.

The two acidic protons are removed by excess sodium hydride. The resulting carbanion then reacts twice with 1,5-dibromopentane, first in an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction and then in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction to form a six-membered ring. The final product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis of Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):** The methylene (-CH₂-) protons give one signal, and the methyl (-CH₃) protons give a second signal.
