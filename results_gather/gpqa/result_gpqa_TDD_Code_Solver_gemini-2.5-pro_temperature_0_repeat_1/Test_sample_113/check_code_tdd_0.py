    # This is a cyanohydrin formation. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of CN- on the carbonyl carbon,
    # followed by protonation of the resulting alkoxide. The reaction is typically catalyzed by a small amount of acid
    # to generate HCN in situ from NaCN and to protonate the intermediate. H3O+ represents this acidic condition.
