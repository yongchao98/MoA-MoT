            "explanation": "This is the correct answer. The less severe phenotype of Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) is due to X-chromosome inactivation (Lyonization). This is a dosage compensation mechanism that silences most genes on one of the X chromosomes in cells with multiple X's. This process occurs post-zygotically (after fertilization) and involves profound epigenetic changes, including chromatin modification via histone methylation by histone methyltransferases, to form a compact, inactive Barr body. Autosomes like chromosome 21 do not undergo such inactivation, leading to a more severe gene dosage imbalance in Down's syndrome."

            "is_correct": False,
            "explanation": "Incorrect. Chiasmata resolution is a step in meiosis I. Like option A, an error in this process can lead to nondisjunction and cause aneuploidy, but it does not explain the difference in phenotypic outcomes after the aneuploidy has occurred."
