    "Here are the small, explicit tests for each statement:\n\n1.  **Test for Statement A:** Verify that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting involving a slippery sequence and a pseudoknot to generate pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins. Confirm that this mechanism is structurally and functionally similar to that of SARS-CoV. This test should pass.\n2.  **Test for Statement B:** Verify that the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is an active exonuclease for mismatch repair. Critically, test the claim that this complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA. This test is expected to fail, as the complex's function is to *degrade* RNA during proofreading, not protect it.\n3.  **Test for Statement C:** Verify that biophysical studies have shown a correlation between the number of unfolding conformations of the frameshifting pseudoknot and the rate of frameshifting. Confirm that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots exhibit two main conformations under tension. This test should pass.\n4.  **Test for Statement D:** Verify that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis. Check if this process involves the activation of caspase-8 (a marker for the extrinsic pathway) while not affecting Bcl-2 levels (a key regulator of the intrinsic pathway). This test should pass.\n\n```python\ndef find_incorrect_sars_cov_2_statement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function evaluates four statements about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology\n    to identify the one that is factually incorrect.
