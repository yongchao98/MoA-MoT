    This function verifies the correct product of the reaction between
    4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine based on established chemical principles.

    The principles are:
    1.  Keto-Enol Tautomerism & Reaction Type: The enol tautomerizes to a ketone,
        which then undergoes alpha-halogenation. The product must be a ketone.
    2.  Regioselectivity: Halogenation occurs at the alpha-carbon (adjacent to the
        carbonyl). For 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the alpha-positions are C2 and C5.
