    "Here is the step-by-step TDD approach to solving the chemical identification puzzle.\n\n### 1. List of Tests\n\n1.  **Test Case 1 (Correct Identification):** Given the spectral data from the problem, the function should correctly identify 'D' (4-chlorobenzoic acid) from the list of all four options.\n2.  **Test Case 2 (IR Rejection):** A compound that is not a carboxylic acid (like option C, Phenyl chloroformate) should be filtered out by the IR data analysis step.\n3.  **Test Case 3 (NMR Rejection):** A carboxylic acid with the wrong substitution pattern (like option A, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which is *ortho*-substituted) should be filtered out by the NMR data analysis step.\n4.  **Test Case 4 (No Match):** If none of the provided options match the spectral data (e.g., a list containing only a *meta*-substituted isomer), the function should return `None` or an equivalent indicator that no valid structure was found.\n\n### 2.

    "The spectral data points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid for the following reasons:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry**: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 in an approximate 3:1 ratio (100:32) is the classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope), so this data confirms the presence of chlorine but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **IR Spectroscopy**: The very broad absorption between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O carbonyl stretch of a carboxylic acid. This combination strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which eliminates options B (aldehyde/phenol) and C (chloroformate).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H is the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid.\n    *   The aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm). This symmetrical pattern is the hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of equivalent protons on opposite sides of the ring split each other into doublets.\n    *   2-chlorobenzoic acid (Option A) is *ortho*-substituted and would show a more complex pattern with four different aromatic proton signals.\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option D) is *para*-substituted and its structure perfectly matches the observed NMR spectrum.\n\nBased on the combined evidence, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
