def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by re-deriving the solution from the problem statement.

    Problem Statement:
    - The number of stars per unit parallax interval (dN/d(plx)) varies as 1/plx^5.
      So, dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵.
    - We need to find how the number of stars per unit distance interval (dN/dr) varies with distance (r).

    Derivation:
    1. The relationship between distance (r) and parallax (plx) is plx ∝ 1/r = r⁻¹.
    2. We use the chain rule to relate the distributions: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr).
    3. We need the derivative of plx with respect to r:
       d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) ∝ -r⁻². So, d(plx)/dr ∝ r⁻².
    4. Substitute the proportionalities into the chain rule:
       dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (r⁻²)
    5. Now, express everything in terms of r by substituting plx ∝ r⁻¹:
       dN/dr ∝ ((r⁻¹)⁻⁵) * (r⁻²)
       dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (r⁻²)
       dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)
       dN/dr ∝ r³
