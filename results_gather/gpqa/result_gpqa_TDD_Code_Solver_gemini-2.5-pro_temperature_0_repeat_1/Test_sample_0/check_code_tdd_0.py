    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2), the
    # uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) is related to its lifetime (Δt or τ).
    # For order-of-magnitude problems, this is often approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.
    
    # For two energy levels to be "clearly resolved", their energy difference
    # must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties.
    # Condition: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2

    # Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
