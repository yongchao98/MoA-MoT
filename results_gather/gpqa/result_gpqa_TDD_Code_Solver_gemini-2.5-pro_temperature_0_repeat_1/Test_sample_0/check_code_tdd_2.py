def check_energy_level_resolution():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum energy level resolution problem.
    
    The problem asks for a possible energy difference between two quantum states
    with given lifetimes, such that the energy levels can be clearly resolved.
    
    The core principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:
    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2. For practical resolution, we use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.
    
    To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater
    than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).
