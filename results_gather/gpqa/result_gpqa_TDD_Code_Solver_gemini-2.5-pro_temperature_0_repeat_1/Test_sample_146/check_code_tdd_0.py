    This function verifies the answer to the physics problem by recalculating the result

    Problem:
    Annihilation process: p + p_bar -> 2A+ + 2A-
    Initial state: Antiproton is slowly moving (initial KE is negligible).
    Given: m_A * c^2 = 300 MeV

    The function will:
    1. Use the standard rest mass energy of a proton.
    2. Apply conservation of energy to find the total energy of each resulting particle A.
    3. Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation to calculate the velocity of particle A.
    4. Compare the calculated velocity with the provided answer options to verify the correctness of the choice 'A'.
