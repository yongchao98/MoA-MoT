    "Here is the solution developed using Test-Driven Development.\n\n### 1. Tests\nHere are a few small, explicit tests that the solution should satisfy, based on the chemical principles of the Diels-Alder reaction and NOESY NMR spectroscopy.\n\n*   **Test 1 (Major Product Proximity):** For the major (*endo*) product, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm, 2H) should be spatially close to the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm, 6H). This proximity should be identified as the source of the unique NOESY cross-peak.\n*   **Test 2 (Minor Product Proximity):** For the minor (*exo*) product, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm, 2H) should be far from the vinylic methyl protons (~1.7 ppm, 6H). This proximity should not be identified.\n*   **Test 3 (Alternative Proximity):** For the minor (*exo*) product, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm, 2H) are close to the bridge protons (~1.5 ppm, 1H+1H). A test should confirm that this interaction is characteristic of the minor product, not the major one.\n*   **Test 4 (Correct Answer Format):** The final output should be the letter corresponding to the correct option. Based on the analysis, the cross-peak is between the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm, which is option B.\n\n### 2.

    "An analysis of the reaction and the resulting stereoisomers is required to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride (the dienophile) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene).\n    *   **Maleic Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃):** A symmetric molecule with two equivalent vinylic protons (giving a single ¹H NMR peak) and two sets of equivalent carbons (vinylic and carbonyl), matching the spectral data provided.\n    *   **Diene (C₉H₁₄):** A substituted cyclopentadiene.\n    *   **Reaction:** C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The molecular formula of the products is confirmed.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry (Products):** The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Due to the planar nature of the dienophile, it can approach the diene from two faces, leading to two stereoisomeric products:\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** Formed via a transition state with stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. In this product, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge. This is kinetically favored and is typically the major product.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C7 bridge. This is thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored.\n\n3.  **NOESY Spectroscopy:** This 2D NMR technique detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), revealing through-space correlations. A cross-peak between two signals indicates that the corresponding protons are spatially proximate. The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. We must find the pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Structural Analysis and Proton Assignment:**\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the product structure (a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative):\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (2H):** The two protons from the original maleic anhydride. They are on the fused five-membered ring. Their chemical shift, being adjacent to carbonyls in a strained system, is downfield, corresponding to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (6H):** The two methyl groups on the double bond of the product. Methyls on a double bond resonate around 1.7-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (6H):** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. These are in a less deshielded environment and correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (2H):** The two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. These are in a saturated, strained environment, corresponding to signals around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Proximity in Isomers:**\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the main ring system. This geometry brings the **anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm)** very close to the **vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm)**. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointed away. In this conformation, the **anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm)** are far from the **vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm)**, so no NOE cross-peak would be observed. Instead, the anhydride protons are now close to the protons on the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The NOE cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   Vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
