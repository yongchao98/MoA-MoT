    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by verifying the chemical deductions and calculations.
    
    The logic follows these steps:
    1. Verify the identity of element Y (Antimony) and compound A2 (SbF3) using the given fluorine mass percentage.
    2. Assume A4 is one of the stable binary fluorides of Antimony (SbF3 or SbF5).
    3. Calculate the molecular weights of these candidates.
    4. Check which candidate's molecular weight falls into one of the given ranges.
    5. Confirm that the result matches the provided answer and that the choice is unambiguous.
