    Checks the correctness of the answer for the aza-Cope rearrangement of
    (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene.

    The function simulates the logical steps of a chemical analysis:
    1. Identify the reacting system.
    2. Predict the bond changes based on the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement mechanism.
    3. Determine the structure of the resulting product, including likely tautomerization.
    4. Compare this predicted structure against the options provided.

    # --- Step 1: Define the problem ---
    reactant = "(1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene"
    reaction_type = "Aza-Cope rearrangement, a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift."

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the reaction mechanism ---
    # The 1,5-diene system for the [3,3] shift is C5=C6-C1-N2-CH=CH2.
    # Bond breaking: The sigma bond between position 3 (C1) and 4 (N2) breaks.
    # Bond formation: A new sigma bond forms between position 1 (C5) and 6 (the terminal vinyl CH2).
    # Pi bond migration: The double bonds shift to C1=C6 and N2=CH(vinyl).
    # Initial product: This forms a fused bicyclic system containing a cyclopentene ring and a
    # six-membered ring with an imine (C=N) functional group.

    # --- Step 3: Consider tautomerization ---
    # The options provided (e.g., '1H', '3H') suggest the presence of an N-H bond,
    # which means the initial imine product (C4-C3-N=CH-CH2-C5) is expected to
    # tautomerize to the more stable enamine form (C4-C3-NH-CH=CH-C5).
    
    # --- Step 4: Define the final product's key structural features ---

The 'tetrahydro' designation at positions 4, 4a, 7, and 7a, under a standard IUPAC numbering scheme for the parent aromatic, results in a structure with one double bond in the 5-membered ring and one in the 6-membered ring.
