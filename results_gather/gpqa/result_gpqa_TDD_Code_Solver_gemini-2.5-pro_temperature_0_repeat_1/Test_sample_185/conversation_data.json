    "Here is the solution using the Test-Driven Development methodology.\n\n### 1. Tests\n\n1.  **Isomer Test**: The product of a Cope rearrangement, which is a pericyclic reaction, must be an isomer of the starting material. The starting material, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, has the molecular formula C8H11N. The proposed product must also have the formula C8H11N.\n2.  **Reaction Type Test**: The reaction is an aza-Cope rearrangement, a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift. This involves the hexa-1,5-diene system `C5=C6-C1-N2-C(vinyl)=C(vinyl)`.\n3.  **Skeletal Transformation Test**: This specific reaction, often part of an aza-Cope-Mannich cascade, is known to transform the `2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene` skeleton into a `cyclopenta[c]pyridine` (an azabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) skeleton.\n4.  **Constitutional Isomer Test**: The final product's constitution (the specific arrangement of atoms, bonds, and hydrogens) must match the outcome of the rearrangement and subsequent intramolecular cyclization. This test will check if the chosen option represents the correct connectivity and placement of double bonds.\n\n### 2.
