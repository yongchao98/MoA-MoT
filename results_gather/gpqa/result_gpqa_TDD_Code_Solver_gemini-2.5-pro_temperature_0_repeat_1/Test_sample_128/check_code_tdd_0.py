    # --- Verification Steps ---

    # Step 1: Deduce Compound A from the Wittig reaction (Hint a)
    # A Wittig reaction forms a C=C bond from a C=O bond.
    # The retro-Wittig analysis on '1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane'
    # involves cleaving the double bond at position 4.
    # The 'propan-2-ylidene' part (=C(CH3)2) comes from the ylide.
    # The rest comes from the ketone A. Replacing the double bond with a carbonyl group
    # at position 4 gives a ketone with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2.
    # According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbonyl carbon (C=O) is assigned position 1.
    # Therefore, the methyl groups are at positions 3 and 4 relative to the carbonyl.
    deduced_A = "3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one"

    # Step 2: Verify Compound A with its IR hint (Hint b)
    # The name 'cyclopentan-1-one' indicates a 5-membered ring ketone.
    # The IR value of ~1750 cm-1 is characteristic of ring strain in cyclopentanones.
    if "cyclopentan" not in deduced_A:
        return f"Reasoning Error: Deduced Compound A ('{deduced_A}') is not a cyclopentanone, which contradicts the IR hint of ~1750 cm-1."

    # Step 3: Analyze the reaction sequence (A -> B -> C -> D -> E)
    # A (ketone) + HCN -> B (cyanohydrin)
    # B + H2/Pd -> C (reduction of nitrile to primary amine, forming a beta-amino alcohol)
    # C + HNO2 -> D (diazonium salt formation)
    # D -> E + N2 (rearrangement with loss of N2)
    # This sequence is a classic Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement, which results
    # in a one-carbon ring expansion.
    # Starting ring: 5-membered (cyclopentane from A)
    # Final ring: 6-membered (cyclohexane in E)
    
    # Step 4: Deduce Compound E's structure
    # The rearrangement inserts the carbon from the aminomethyl group into the ring.
    # Starting with 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one, the rearrangement will produce
    # a cyclohexanone. The two possible migration pathways of the ring carbons
    # both lead to the same constitutional isomer.
    # The methyl groups, originally at C3 and C4 of the cyclopentanone, will be
    # at positions C3 and C4 of the resulting cyclohexanone.
    deduced_E = "3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one"

    # Step 5: Verify Compound E with its IR hint (Hint b)
    # The name 'cyclohexan-1-one' indicates a 6-membered ring ketone.
    # The IR value of ~1715 cm-1 is characteristic of a relatively strain-free cyclohexanone.

        return f"Reasoning Error: Deduced Compound E ('{deduced_E}') is not a cyclohexanone, which contradicts the IR hint of ~1715 cm-1."
