The two reactions produce enantiomeric lactones, which are cyclic esters. The formation of the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a δ-lactone), requires an intermediate with a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group on the same molecule, specifically 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not affect the chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material (which becomes the 4-position in the lactone product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To produce the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH₃) is a highly selective reagent that reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n*   The resulting molecule is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the same lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction A, the chiral center is not altered during the reaction sequence. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct pair of starting materials is A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The product in both reactions is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of cyclic ester known as a δ-lactone. The specific product is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Precursor:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at carbon 1 to form the six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other.\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Reaction:** To convert the starting material (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) into the necessary precursor (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid), the **isobutyl ester group must be reduced to a primary alcohol**, while the carboxylic acid group must remain unchanged.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reagents and Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reduction of the carbonyl group in the ester does not affect the existing stereocenter at carbon 3 of the starting material. This carbon becomes the stereocenter at carbon 4 in the final lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material will be retained in the product.\n\n*   An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-configured product.\n*   An (S)-configured starting material will produce an (S)-configured product.\n\n### **Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. This is precisely the transformation required.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the product has the (R) configuration, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters, which is the opposite of what is required to form the specified product. However, given that the (S)-lactone is the stated product, we must deduce the identity of B based on this outcome. For the reaction to yield 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the ester group must be reduced.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Assuming the reaction proceeds to the given product, the stereochemistry is retained. Since the product has the (S) configuration, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product and its Precursor**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   It's a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring system).\n*   The stereocenter is at carbon-4, which has an ethyl group attached.\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. The precursor to this specific six-membered lactone is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n```\n      HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH\n```\n\nDuring lactonization (either by acid-catalyzed esterification or transesterification), the hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (or ester) at C1. This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 in the lactone. Therefore, the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of the starting material's chiral center is preserved in the final lactone product.\n\n*   An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-configured starting material will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid). It contains two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) at one end.\n2.  An **isobutyl ester** group (-COO-iBu) at the other end.\n\n```\n      HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu\n```\nThe stereocenter is at C3.\n\nTo form the lactone, one of these carbonyl groups must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) to create the necessary hydroxy-acid (or hydroxy-ester) precursor. The key to this problem is the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane (usually as BH3·THF) is a highly selective reducing agent. It readily reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride):** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4. It reduces esters to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce carboxylic acids, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the ester. This is because the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts first with the hydride to form a lithium carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻ Li⁺`), which is much less electrophilic and thus resistant to further reduction.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Selectivity to Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction 1:**\n*   **A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces the **ester** group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `A` (which is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`) reacts with LiBH4. The ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The intermediate is the hydroxy-acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction sequence does not affect the stereocenter. Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2:**\n*   **B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `B` (which is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`) reacts with BH3. The carboxylic acid at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The intermediate is the hydroxy-ester: `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification (the new OH group attacks the ester carbonyl) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also does not affect the stereocenter. Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of lactone (a cyclic ester). The specific name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   A \"pyran-2-one\" ring is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (at position 1) and a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated (no double bonds in the ring).\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) at position 4 of the ring.\n*   The molecule has a chiral center at C4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions specify the stereochemistry as (R) for the first reaction and (S) for the second.\n\nA lactone like this is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The linear precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2OH`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decode this name to determine the structure.\n\n*   \"Pentanoic acid\" indicates a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\" means an ethyl group is at C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" describes a substituent at C5. This is an isobutyl ester group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n*   Combining these pieces, the structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`.\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It has a chiral center at C3, the carbon with the ethyl group.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Structural Mismatch and Correction**\nThere is a discrepancy. The starting material has the ethyl group at C3, which would lead to a `3-ethyl` lactone. The product is named as a `4-ethyl` lactone. This is a very common type of typo in chemistry problems. The most logical assumption is that the product name has a typo and should be **3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. With this correction, the carbon skeleton of the starting material matches that of the product, and the problem becomes a test of reagent selectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Selectivity of LiBH₄.** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereochemistry.** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Selectivity of BH₃.** Borane is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it does *not* typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate (`HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Stereochemistry.** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe products of both reactions are stereoisomers of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   This is a **lactone**, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   The \"pyran\" part indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   The \"-2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group at position 2.\n*   The \"tetrahydro\" indicates a saturated ring.\n*   The \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group at position 4.\n*   The chiral center is at C4, which is bonded to a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different CH2 groups within the ring.\n\nA six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from the intramolecular esterification of a **5-hydroxy carboxylic acid**. The linear precursor for our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's trace the carbon chain:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The carbon chain `C1-C2-C3-C4-C5` and the hydroxyl oxygen form the ring.\n*   The C1 becomes the carbonyl carbon of the lactone (position 2 in IUPAC lactone nomenclature).\n*   The C3 of the acid chain, which is the chiral center, becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry (R or S) of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization process. An (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form an (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and an (S)-acid will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n\nStructure: `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl groups that can be reduced. The key to solving the problem is understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Selectivity:** When presented with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ is selective for the **ester**. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride (H⁻) to form a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻Li⁺), which is much less electrophilic and resistant to reduction by LiBH₄. The ester group, however, is readily reduced to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged (it is reprotonated during the acidic workup).\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. LiBH₄, 2. H⁺)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl carbons, not at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane is a highly selective reagent that reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. BH₃, 2. H⁺)--> `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the final lactone (and isobutanol as a byproduct).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not involve the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group, known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. The precursor to our product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the final lactone.\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options suggest the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name. It is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one carboxylic acid group is a free acid (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\nLet's trace the two reaction pathways:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 untouched.\n    `A (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --LiBH₄--> `Intermediate 1 (HO-CH₂-R-COOH)`\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy-acid to form the delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 1` --H⁺--> `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 untouched.\n    `B (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --BH₃--> `Intermediate 2 (iBu-OOC-R-CH₂OH)`\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 2` --H⁺--> `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3). However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n\n**Groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material:**\n*   G1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n*   G2: `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n*   G3: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n*   G4: `-H`\n**CIP Priority Order:** G1 > G2 > G3 > G4. (The ester group outranks the acid group because O-C has priority over O-H).\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1 (A → (R)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 1 (the hydroxy-acid):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOH` (originally G2)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G1)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups inverts the R/S designation.\n*   Therefore, to get an (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R). To get an (R)-intermediate, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n*   Path: `(S)-A` → `(R)-Intermediate 1` → `(R)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2 (B → (S)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 2 (the hydroxy-ester):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOiBu` (originally G1)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G2)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priority order remains the same: New G1' > New G2' > New G3'.\n*   Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction.\n*   Therefore, to get an (S)-lactone, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   Path: `(S)-B` → `(S)-Intermediate 2` → `(S)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The structure has a stereocenter at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\n```\n      O=C(2)\n     /     \\\n  C(3)H2    O(1)  <-- Ring Oxygen\n  |         |\nC(4)H(Et)   C(6)H2  <-- Stereocenter at C4\n  \\         /\n   --C(5)H2--\n```\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one of the carboxylic acid groups is converted into an isobutyl ester. The name \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" is a bit convoluted, but it describes the following structure, which is a mono-ester of a dicarboxylic acid.\n\n```\n      O                O\n     //               //\nHO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu   (where iBu = isobutyl)\n                    |\n                    Et  <-- Stereocenter at C3\n```\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an ester at the other end (C5). The stereocenter at C3 in the starting material will become the stereocenter at C4 in the lactone product. The reactions do not break any bonds at the stereocenter, so the spatial arrangement of the groups is maintained. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups changes, which could change the R/S designation.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate is (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid).\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the alcohol at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered lactone.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to compare the CIP priorities of the groups attached to the stereocenter before and after the reaction.\n    *   **Starting Material (at C3):**\n        1.  -CH₂-COOiBu (ester side)\n        2.  -CH₂-COOH (acid side)\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Product (at C4):**\n        1.  -CH₂-C(=O)O- (ring portion towards the carbonyl)\n        2.  -CH₂-CH₂-O- (ring portion towards the ether oxygen)\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Mapping the groups:**\n        *   The acid side (-CH₂-COOH, priority 2) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (priority 1).\n        *   The ester side (-CH₂-COOiBu, priority 1) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (priority 2).\n        *   The ethyl group remains priority 3.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (1 ↔ 2). Swapping two groups at a stereocenter inverts its configuration (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the reaction causes an inversion of the stereochemical descriptor, to obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   (S)-A → (R)-Product\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol at C1 attacks the ester at C5 to form the six-membered lactone, eliminating isobutanol.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We use the same priority assignments as in step 3.\n    *   **Mapping the groups:**\n        *   The ester side (-CH₂-COOiBu, priority 1) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (priority 1).\n        *   The acid side (-CH₂-COOH, priority 2) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (priority 2).\n        *   The ethyl group remains priority 3.\n    *   The priorities of all groups are maintained in the same order. This means the reaction proceeds with retention of the stereochemical descriptor.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the reaction causes retention of configuration, to obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration.\n    *   (S)-B → (S)-Product\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.

The two reactions use different reducing agents, leading to different intermediate products and ultimately different stereoisomers of the final lactone.\n\n**Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  Starting material A, which is (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is treated with LiBH₄.\n    2.

BH3 is an electrophilic reducing agent that coordinates to the electron-rich carbonyl oxygen. It is one of the best methods for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** LiBH4 is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4.\n\nNow, let's apply this confirmed selectivity to the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH4 → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** A is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, specifically (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu).\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 reacts with the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. This carbon becomes the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH3 → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** B is also (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 (originally from the C1 carboxyl group that was reduced) attacks the ester carbonyl at C1 (originally C5) in an intramolecular transesterification. This process forms the lactone and releases isobutanol.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions occur at the functional groups and do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.

It is less reactive than LiAlH4 but more reactive than NaBH4. The greater reactivity compared to NaBH4 is due to the Lewis-acidic lithium ion which activates the carbonyl group. Therefore, in the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid, will then undergo intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone. The stereocenter at the ethyl-bearing carbon is not affected during this process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Reaction B with BH3**: Borane (BH3) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. While NaBH4 is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids, BH3 reduces them rapidly to primary alcohols. In the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, will then undergo intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone. Again, the stereocenter is unaffected. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nBased on this confirmed selectivity:\n*   Starting material A is treated with LiBH4 (ester reduction) to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is treated with BH3 (carboxylic acid reduction) to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

The carboxylic acid group remains intact. The subsequent acid workup (`H+`) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product. Since the reaction does not affect the stereocenter, the (R)-product must originate from the (R)-starting material. Therefore, A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** Borane (`BH3`) is a strong reducing agent that preferentially reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched. The acid workup then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the same lactone product. As with the first reaction, the stereocenter is not altered. Thus, the (S)-product must come from the (S)-starting material. Therefore, B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe analysis of the two reactions hinges on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3).\n\n### **Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** In this reaction, LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group at one end of the starting material (compound A) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group at the other end remains unaffected. The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** Upon acidic workup (H+), the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, leading to an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material (which becomes the 4-position in the product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.

This forms a 5-hydroxy ester.\n*   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As with the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the reduction or cyclization steps. Consequently, the stereochemistry is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which means the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Therefore, **B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The problem requires us to identify the correct stereoisomers of a starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, for two different reduction reactions that yield stereoisomeric lactones. The key to solving this lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and how they affect the starting material to form the final product.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the structure of the starting material and the product. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester with a stereocenter at the C-3 position. The product is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester), also with a stereocenter.\n2.  Analyze the first reaction: A + LiBH4 → (R)-lactone. I will determine the known selectivity of LiBH4. It is known to reduce esters but not carboxylic acids. This reduction would form a hydroxy acid, which upon acidic workup, would cyclize to the lactone. I will assume the stereocenter is not affected during this process (retention of configuration). This will allow me to determine the required stereochemistry of starting material A.\n3.  Analyze the second reaction: B + BH3 → (S)-lactone. I will determine the known selectivity of BH3. It is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids over esters. This would form a hydroxy ester, which cannot directly cyclize to the given lactone. I need to investigate this apparent contradiction. It's possible that under the reaction conditions, a subsequent intramolecular transesterification occurs, or that the selectivity rules have an exception in this specific molecular context. I will search for reactions of dicarboxylic acid monoesters with borane.\n4.  Based on the reaction mechanisms, I will deduce the stereochemistry of B required to produce the (S)-lactone.\n5.  Finally, I will combine the findings for A and B to select the correct option.\n\nMy immediate action will be to search for the selectivity of LiBH4 and BH3 in reducing molecules containing both carboxylic acid and ester functional groups, and the mechanism of lactone formation in these cases.\n\nSkeptic: Your plan is logical, but it hinges on a critical point in step 3 that you've already identified as a potential contradiction.\n1.  The assumption of retention of stereochemistry in the LiBH4 reaction is reasonable, as the reaction center (the ester) is remote from the stereocenter (C-3). Your conclusion for A will likely be correct.\n2.  The major failure point is the BH3 reaction. The primary selectivity of BH3 (reducing the carboxylic acid) leads to an intermediate that does not form the product. You cannot simply assume it reduces the ester instead, just because that would lead to the product. Why would BH3 violate its known selectivity? Is there an intramolecular complex that changes its reactivity? Or does the initially formed hydroxy-ester undergo a rearrangement or a subsequent, non-obvious reaction to form the lactone?\n3.  You also haven't fully considered the stereochemical outcome of the BH3 reaction. While you plan to investigate it, you must be careful not to assume retention or inversion without a clear mechanistic basis. The reaction could be stereospecific, stereoselective, or non-selective.\n4.  Missing facts are crucial here: We need a definitive source on how borane reacts with a compound like 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Does it reduce the ester or the acid? And what is the stereochemical outcome at the C-3 position?\n\nI agree with your proposed action. We must clarify the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monoesters and borane.\n\nDecided next action: Execute the search to clarify the selectivity of these reducing agents.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis and provide the necessary details to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1 (LiBH4):** The search results confirm that LiBH4 selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has an ester group and a carboxylic acid group. LiBH4 will reduce the ester at the C-5 position to a primary alcohol. The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) will cause an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the C-5 hydroxyl group and the C-1 carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The reaction does not involve the stereocenter at C-3, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2 (BH3):** The search results also confirm that borane (BH3) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This contradicts the formation of the specified lactone. If BH3 reduced the carboxylic acid, the product would be a hydroxy-ester (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`), which cannot form the target lactone. There seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement itself. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we must find the most plausible intended answer. Let's reconsider the problem. There is no common mechanism by which BH3 would reduce the ester *instead* of the carboxylic acid, nor is there a standard mechanism that would cause inversion at the remote C-3 stereocenter.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the premise. It is a chemistry problem, likely from a textbook or exam. These problems sometimes contain errors, but more often, they test a subtle point or expect the student to choose the \"best\" fit among the given options.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question and that *both* reactions are intended to proceed via reduction of the ester to form the lactone, but perhaps test knowledge of two different reagents that *could* do this, even if one is unconventional or misrepresented. This is a weak assumption.\n\nA stronger approach is to trust our analysis for Reaction 1, which is based on solid, well-documented chemical principles.\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\nThis eliminates options A and C. The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\nNow we must decide between B and D, which only differ in the stereochemistry of compound B.\n*   Option B: B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Option D: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe reaction with B produces the (S)-lactone. If we assume the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration (the most common outcome when the stereocenter is not directly involved), then starting material B must be (S). This would point to option D.\n\nLet's reconsider the BH3 reaction. Is there any way for it to work as written?\n`B + BH3 → (S)-lactone`\nThe only way to get the lactone is to reduce the ester. The only way to get the (S)-lactone (assuming retention) is to start with (S)-B. This leads directly to option D. The entire difficulty lies in the fact that BH3 shouldn't perform this reaction.\n\nGiven the constraints of a multiple-choice question, it is most probable that the question intends for the student to identify the necessary stereochemistry of the starting material to produce the given product, assuming a reaction pathway that leads to the product (even if the reagent specified for that pathway is incorrect). The stereochemical outcome is the core of the question.\n\n*   Reaction A: (R)-starter → (R)-product (retention)\n*   Reaction B: (S)-starter → (S)-product (retention)\n\nThis is the most chemically consistent interpretation of the stereochemistry, despite the error in reagent choice for reaction B.\n\nTherefore:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nSkeptic: I agree with your analysis of the LiBH4 reaction. A is definitively (R). I also agree that the stated reaction with BH3 is incorrect based on its known selectivity. The problem is flawed. However, your conclusion to select an answer by assuming the reaction *does* happen and proceeds with retention of stereochemistry is a pragmatic way to approach a flawed multiple-choice question. The question is likely designed to test the stereochemical relationship between the reactant and product in a lactonization reaction, but mistakenly uses BH3. If we accept this premise, then to get the (S)-lactone, one must start with the (S)-acid. This leads to option D. There is no chemical basis for inversion of configuration, which would be required if B were (R) (Option B). Therefore, D is the most plausible intended answer, despite the chemical inaccuracy of the question's premise for the second reaction.\n\nFinal conclusion reached.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "This problem requires a careful analysis of both the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the reactions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-C*H(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups (acid or ester) must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). This creates a hydroxy-acid or hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes (via intramolecular esterification or transesterification) to form the lactone.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction A (with LiBH₄)\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reagent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to the lactone upon acidic workup.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Stereochemical Outcome.** The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3). However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center change, as this can change the R/S designation.\n    *   **Groups at C3 (Start):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side) and `-CH₂COOH` (acid side). The ester side has higher priority than the acid side. Let's call them P1 and P2, respectively.\n    *   **Groups at C3 (After Reduction):** The ester side (P1) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid side (P2) remains `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   **Priority Change:** The `-CH₂COOH` group now has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The original P1 group has become the new P2 group, and the original P2 group has become the new P1 group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. This causes an **inversion of the R/S descriptor**. Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction B (with BH₃)\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 3: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester at C5 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, which cyclizes to the lactone via transesterification.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Stereochemical Outcome.** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Groups at C3 (Start):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (P1) and `-CH₂COOH` (P2).\n    *   **Groups at C3 (After Reduction):** The ester side (P1) remains `-CH₂COOiBu`. The acid side (P2) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   **Priority Change:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group still has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups is **retained**. Therefore, the R/S descriptor is also **retained**. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of chemoselectivity and stereochemical nomenclature:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The two reactions produce enantiomeric lactones, which are cyclic esters. The formation of the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a δ-lactone), requires an intermediate with a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group on the same molecule, specifically 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.

The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the same lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in reaction A, the chiral center is not altered during the reaction sequence. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct pair of starting materials is A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The product in both reactions is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of cyclic ester known as a δ-lactone. The specific product is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Precursor:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The hydroxyl group (-OH) at carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at carbon 1 to form the six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other.\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Reaction:** To convert the starting material (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) into the necessary precursor (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid), the **isobutyl ester group must be reduced to a primary alcohol**, while the carboxylic acid group must remain unchanged.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reagents and Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reduction of the carbonyl group in the ester does not affect the existing stereocenter at carbon 3 of the starting material. This carbon becomes the stereocenter at carbon 4 in the final lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material will be retained in the product.\n\n*   An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-configured product.\n*   An (S)-configured starting material will produce an (S)-configured product.\n\n### **Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.

However, given that the (S)-lactone is the stated product, we must deduce the identity of B based on this outcome. For the reaction to yield 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the ester group must be reduced.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Assuming the reaction proceeds to the given product, the stereochemistry is retained.

The precursor to this specific six-membered lactone is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n```\n      HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH\n```\n\nDuring lactonization (either by acid-catalyzed esterification or transesterification), the hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (or ester) at C1. This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 in the lactone. Therefore, the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of the starting material's chiral center is preserved in the final lactone product.\n\n*   An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-configured starting material will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid). It contains two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) at one end.\n2.  An **isobutyl ester** group (-COO-iBu) at the other end.\n\n```\n      HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu\n```\nThe stereocenter is at C3.\n\nTo form the lactone, one of these carbonyl groups must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) to create the necessary hydroxy-acid (or hydroxy-ester) precursor. The key to this problem is the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane (usually as BH3·THF) is a highly selective reducing agent. It readily reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride):** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4. It reduces esters to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce carboxylic acids, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the ester. This is because the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts first with the hydride to form a lithium carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻ Li⁺`), which is much less electrophilic and thus resistant to further reduction.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Selectivity to Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction 1:**\n*   **A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces the **ester** group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `A` (which is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`) reacts with LiBH4.

The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification (the new OH group attacks the ester carbonyl) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also does not affect the stereocenter. Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of lactone (a cyclic ester). The specific name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   A \"pyran-2-one\" ring is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (at position 1) and a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated (no double bonds in the ring).\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) at position 4 of the ring.\n*   The molecule has a chiral center at C4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions specify the stereochemistry as (R) for the first reaction and (S) for the second.\n\nA lactone like this is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The linear precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2OH`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decode this name to determine the structure.\n\n*   \"Pentanoic acid\" indicates a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\" means an ethyl group is at C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" describes a substituent at C5. This is an isobutyl ester group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n*   Combining these pieces, the structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`.\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It has a chiral center at C3, the carbon with the ethyl group.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Structural Mismatch and Correction**\nThere is a discrepancy. The starting material has the ethyl group at C3, which would lead to a `3-ethyl` lactone. The product is named as a `4-ethyl` lactone. This is a very common type of typo in chemistry problems. The most logical assumption is that the product name has a typo and should be **3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. With this correction, the carbon skeleton of the starting material matches that of the product, and the problem becomes a test of reagent selectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Selectivity of LiBH₄.** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereochemistry.** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Selectivity of BH₃.** Borane is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it does *not* typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate (`HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Stereochemistry.** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe products of both reactions are stereoisomers of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   This is a **lactone**, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   The \"pyran\" part indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   The \"-2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group at position 2.\n*   The \"tetrahydro\" indicates a saturated ring.\n*   The \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group at position 4.\n*   The chiral center is at C4, which is bonded to a hydrogen, an ethyl group, and two different CH2 groups within the ring.\n\nA six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from the intramolecular esterification of a **5-hydroxy carboxylic acid**. The linear precursor for our product is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's trace the carbon chain:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH`\n\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The carbon chain `C1-C2-C3-C4-C5` and the hydroxyl oxygen form the ring.\n*   The C1 becomes the carbonyl carbon of the lactone (position 2 in IUPAC lactone nomenclature).\n*   The C3 of the acid chain, which is the chiral center, becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry (R or S) of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization process. An (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form an (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and an (S)-acid will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n\nStructure: `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl groups that can be reduced. The key to solving the problem is understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Selectivity:** When presented with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ is selective for the **ester**. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride (H⁻) to form a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻Li⁺), which is much less electrophilic and resistant to reduction by LiBH₄. The ester group, however, is readily reduced to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged (it is reprotonated during the acidic workup).\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. LiBH₄, 2. H⁺)--> `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl carbons, not at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reducing Agent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane is a highly selective reagent that reduces **carboxylic acids** much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH` --(1. BH₃, 2. H⁺)--> `iBuOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    4.  Under the acidic workup conditions (H⁺), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the final lactone (and isobutanol as a byproduct).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reactions do not involve the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained. To produce the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group, known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification (cyclization) of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. The precursor to our product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center in this precursor is at C3, which corresponds to C4 in the final lactone.\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options suggest the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name. It is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one carboxylic acid group is a free acid (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   Structure: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to this problem is the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\nLet's trace the two reaction pathways:\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 untouched.\n    `A (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --LiBH₄--> `Intermediate 1 (HO-CH₂-R-COOH)`\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy-acid to form the delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 1` --H⁺--> `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 untouched.\n    `B (iBu-OOC-R-COOH)` --BH₃--> `Intermediate 2 (iBu-OOC-R-CH₂OH)`\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n2.  **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same delta-lactone.\n    `Intermediate 2` --H⁺--> `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n### **3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3). However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n\n**Groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material:**\n*   G1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n*   G2: `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n*   G3: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n*   G4: `-H`\n**CIP Priority Order:** G1 > G2 > G3 > G4. (The ester group outranks the acid group because O-C has priority over O-H).\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1 (A → (R)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 1 (the hydroxy-acid):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOH` (originally G2)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G1)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups inverts the R/S designation.\n*   Therefore, to get an (R)-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy-acid must be (R). To get an (R)-intermediate, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n*   Path: `(S)-A` → `(R)-Intermediate 1` → `(R)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2 (B → (S)-Lactone):**\n*   The reaction converts G2 (`-CH₂COOH`) into `-CH₂CH₂OH`. G1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n*   Let's determine the new priorities in Intermediate 2 (the hydroxy-ester):\n    *   New G1': `-CH₂COOiBu` (originally G1)\n    *   New G2': `-CH₂CH₂OH` (originally from G2)\n    *   New G3': `-CH₂CH₃` (originally G3)\n*   The priority order remains the same: New G1' > New G2' > New G3'.\n*   Since the priority order does not change, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction.\n*   Therefore, to get an (S)-lactone, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   Path: `(S)-B` → `(S)-Intermediate 2` → `(S)-Lactone`.\n*   Conclusion: **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials A and B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group, which is known as a delta-lactone. The structure has a stereocenter at carbon 4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\n```\n      O=C(2)\n     /     \\\n  C(3)H2    O(1)  <-- Ring Oxygen\n  |         |\nC(4)H(Et)   C(6)H2  <-- Stereocenter at C4\n  \\         /\n   --C(5)H2--\n```\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid), where one of the carboxylic acid groups is converted into an isobutyl ester. The name \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\" is a bit convoluted, but it describes the following structure, which is a mono-ester of a dicarboxylic acid.\n\n```\n      O                O\n     //               //\nHO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu   (where iBu = isobutyl)\n                    |\n                    Et  <-- Stereocenter at C3\n```\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an ester at the other end (C5). The stereocenter at C3 in the starting material will become the stereocenter at C4 in the lactone product. The reactions do not break any bonds at the stereocenter, so the spatial arrangement of the groups is maintained. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups changes, which could change the R/S designation.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate is (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid).\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the alcohol at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered lactone.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to compare the CIP priorities of the groups attached to the stereocenter before and after the reaction.\n    *   **Starting Material (at C3):**\n        1.  -CH₂-COOiBu (ester side)\n        2.  -CH₂-COOH (acid side)\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Product (at C4):**\n        1.  -CH₂-C(=O)O- (ring portion towards the carbonyl)\n        2.  -CH₂-CH₂-O- (ring portion towards the ether oxygen)\n        3.  -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Mapping the groups:**\n        *   The acid side (-CH₂-COOH, priority 2) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (priority 1).\n        *   The ester side (-CH₂-COOiBu, priority 1) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (priority 2).\n        *   The ethyl group remains priority 3.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are swapped (1 ↔ 2). Swapping two groups at a stereocenter inverts its configuration (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Since the reaction causes an inversion of the stereochemical descriptor, to obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   (S)-A → (R)-Product\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol at C1 attacks the ester at C5 to form the six-membered lactone, eliminating isobutanol.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We use the same priority assignments as in step 3.\n    *   **Mapping the groups:**\n        *   The ester side (-CH₂-COOiBu, priority 1) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (priority 1).\n        *   The acid side (-CH₂-COOH, priority 2) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (priority 2).\n        *   The ethyl group remains priority 3.\n    *   The priorities of all groups are maintained in the same order. This means the reaction proceeds with retention of the stereochemical descriptor.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Since the reaction causes retention of configuration, to obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration.\n    *   (S)-B → (S)-Product\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Analyze the starting material and product structures to understand the overall transformation.\n    2.

The subsequent acidic workup (H+) will protonate the resulting alkoxide and catalyze an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed alcohol and the carboxylic acid to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at the 3-position of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material A.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B: Reduction with BH3\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material B is also 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group intact. The acidic workup (H+) will then catalyze an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not affect the stereocenter at the 3-position of the starting material. Thus, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material B.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires an understanding of the selectivity of different reducing agents toward various functional groups, specifically carboxylic acids and esters. The final product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy acid. The stereochemistry at the 4-position of the lactone is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material in both cases is a derivative of 3-ethyl-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. The two reactions use different reducing agents, leading to different intermediate products and ultimately different stereoisomers of the final lactone.\n\n**Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  Starting material A, which is (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is treated with LiBH₄.\n    2.  The LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    3.  This forms a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate.\n    4.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material (which becomes the 4-position in the lactone) is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a strong reducing agent that shows a high preference for reducing carboxylic acids over esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  Starting material B, which is (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is treated with BH₃.\n    2.  The BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n    3.  This forms an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate intermediate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at the 3-position is unaffected. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical outcomes:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe search results confirm my initial analysis of the selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane reagents are often used to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. BH3 is an electrophilic reducing agent that coordinates to the electron-rich carbonyl oxygen. It is one of the best methods for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** LiBH4 is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 but weaker than LiAlH4.\n\nNow, let's apply this confirmed selectivity to the two reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH4 → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** A is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, specifically (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu).\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 reacts with the carboxylic acid at C1 in an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the chiral center at C3 of the starting material. This carbon becomes the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH3 → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** B is also (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n2.  **Reducing Agent:** BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid at the C1 position will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while the isobutyl ester at the C5 position will remain unchanged.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The reduction yields isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate.\n4.  **Cyclization:** Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 (originally from the C1 carboxyl group that was reduced) attacks the ester carbonyl at C1 (originally C5) in an intramolecular transesterification. This process forms the lactone and releases isobutanol.\n5.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reactions occur at the functional groups and do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check:\n- Reaction A: (R)-starting material + LiBH4 (ester reduction) -> (R)-lactone. Correct.\n- Reaction B: (S)-starting material + BH3 (acid reduction) -> (S)-lactone. Correct.\n\nThe logic holds.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis of the reactions and the selectivity of the reducing agents is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Reaction A with LiBH4**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is less reactive than LiAlH4 but more reactive than NaBH4. The greater reactivity compared to NaBH4 is due to the Lewis-acidic lithium ion which activates the carbonyl group. Therefore, in the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid, will then undergo intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone. The stereocenter at the ethyl-bearing carbon is not affected during this process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Reaction B with BH3**: Borane (BH3) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. While NaBH4 is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids, BH3 reduces them rapidly to primary alcohols. In the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, will then undergo intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone. Again, the stereocenter is unaffected. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nBased on this confirmed selectivity:\n*   Starting material A is treated with LiBH4 (ester reduction) to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is treated with BH3 (carboxylic acid reduction) to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis correctly identifies the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces the ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains intact. The subsequent acid workup (`H+`) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product. Since the reaction does not affect the stereocenter, the (R)-product must originate from the (R)-starting material. Therefore, A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** Borane (`BH3`) is a strong reducing agent that preferentially reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched. The acid workup then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the same lactone product. As with the first reaction, the stereocenter is not altered. Thus, the (S)-product must come from the (S)-starting material. Therefore, B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe analysis of the two reactions hinges on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3).\n\n### **Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** In this reaction, LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group at one end of the starting material (compound A) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group at the other end remains unaffected. The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** Upon acidic workup (H+), the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, leading to an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material (which becomes the 4-position in the product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction B: Reduction with BH3**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** Borane will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material (compound B) to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. This forms a 5-hydroxy ester.\n*   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As with the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the reduction or cyclization steps. Consequently, the stereochemistry is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which means the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Therefore, **B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The problem requires us to identify the correct stereoisomers of a starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, for two different reduction reactions that yield stereoisomeric lactones. The key to solving this lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and how they affect the starting material to form the final product.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the structure of the starting material and the product. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester with a stereocenter at the C-3 position. The product is a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester), also with a stereocenter.\n2.  Analyze the first reaction: A + LiBH4 → (R)-lactone. I will determine the known selectivity of LiBH4. It is known to reduce esters but not carboxylic acids. This reduction would form a hydroxy acid, which upon acidic workup, would cyclize to the lactone. I will assume the stereocenter is not affected during this process (retention of configuration). This will allow me to determine the required stereochemistry of starting material A.\n3.  Analyze the second reaction: B + BH3 → (S)-lactone. I will determine the known selectivity of BH3. It is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids over esters. This would form a hydroxy ester, which cannot directly cyclize to the given lactone. I need to investigate this apparent contradiction. It's possible that under the reaction conditions, a subsequent intramolecular transesterification occurs, or that the selectivity rules have an exception in this specific molecular context. I will search for reactions of dicarboxylic acid monoesters with borane.\n4.  Based on the reaction mechanisms, I will deduce the stereochemistry of B required to produce the (S)-lactone.\n5.  Finally, I will combine the findings for A and B to select the correct option.\n\nMy immediate action will be to search for the selectivity of LiBH4 and BH3 in reducing molecules containing both carboxylic acid and ester functional groups, and the mechanism of lactone formation in these cases.\n\nSkeptic: Your plan is logical, but it hinges on a critical point in step 3 that you've already identified as a potential contradiction.\n1.  The assumption of retention of stereochemistry in the LiBH4 reaction is reasonable, as the reaction center (the ester) is remote from the stereocenter (C-3). Your conclusion for A will likely be correct.\n2.  The major failure point is the BH3 reaction. The primary selectivity of BH3 (reducing the carboxylic acid) leads to an intermediate that does not form the product. You cannot simply assume it reduces the ester instead, just because that would lead to the product. Why would BH3 violate its known selectivity? Is there an intramolecular complex that changes its reactivity? Or does the initially formed hydroxy-ester undergo a rearrangement or a subsequent, non-obvious reaction to form the lactone?\n3.  You also haven't fully considered the stereochemical outcome of the BH3 reaction. While you plan to investigate it, you must be careful not to assume retention or inversion without a clear mechanistic basis. The reaction could be stereospecific, stereoselective, or non-selective.\n4.  Missing facts are crucial here: We need a definitive source on how borane reacts with a compound like 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Does it reduce the ester or the acid? And what is the stereochemical outcome at the C-3 position?\n\nI agree with your proposed action. We must clarify the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monoesters and borane.\n\nDecided next action: Execute the search to clarify the selectivity of these reducing agents.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis and provide the necessary details to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1 (LiBH4):** The search results confirm that LiBH4 selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has an ester group and a carboxylic acid group. LiBH4 will reduce the ester at the C-5 position to a primary alcohol. The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) will cause an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the C-5 hydroxyl group and the C-1 carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The reaction does not involve the stereocenter at C-3, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2 (BH3):** The search results also confirm that borane (BH3) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. This contradicts the formation of the specified lactone. If BH3 reduced the carboxylic acid, the product would be a hydroxy-ester (`isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`), which cannot form the target lactone. There seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement itself. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we must find the most plausible intended answer. Let's reconsider the problem. There is no common mechanism by which BH3 would reduce the ester *instead* of the carboxylic acid, nor is there a standard mechanism that would cause inversion at the remote C-3 stereocenter.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the premise. It is a chemistry problem, likely from a textbook or exam. These problems sometimes contain errors, but more often, they test a subtle point or expect the student to choose the \"best\" fit among the given options.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question and that *both* reactions are intended to proceed via reduction of the ester to form the lactone, but perhaps test knowledge of two different reagents that *could* do this, even if one is unconventional or misrepresented. This is a weak assumption.\n\nA stronger approach is to trust our analysis for Reaction 1, which is based on solid, well-documented chemical principles.\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\nThis eliminates options A and C. The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\nNow we must decide between B and D, which only differ in the stereochemistry of compound B.\n*   Option B: B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Option D: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe reaction with B produces the (S)-lactone. If we assume the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration (the most common outcome when the stereocenter is not directly involved), then starting material B must be (S). This would point to option D.\n\nLet's reconsider the BH3 reaction. Is there any way for it to work as written?\n`B + BH3 → (S)-lactone`\nThe only way to get the lactone is to reduce the ester. The only way to get the (S)-lactone (assuming retention) is to start with (S)-B. This leads directly to option D. The entire difficulty lies in the fact that BH3 shouldn't perform this reaction.\n\nGiven the constraints of a multiple-choice question, it is most probable that the question intends for the student to identify the necessary stereochemistry of the starting material to produce the given product, assuming a reaction pathway that leads to the product (even if the reagent specified for that pathway is incorrect). The stereochemical outcome is the core of the question.\n\n*   Reaction A: (R)-starter → (R)-product (retention)\n*   Reaction B: (S)-starter → (S)-product (retention)\n\nThis is the most chemically consistent interpretation of the stereochemistry, despite the error in reagent choice for reaction B.\n\nTherefore:\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nSkeptic: I agree with your analysis of the LiBH4 reaction. A is definitively (R). I also agree that the stated reaction with BH3 is incorrect based on its known selectivity. The problem is flawed. However, your conclusion to select an answer by assuming the reaction *does* happen and proceeds with retention of stereochemistry is a pragmatic way to approach a flawed multiple-choice question. The question is likely designed to test the stereochemical relationship between the reactant and product in a lactonization reaction, but mistakenly uses BH3. If we accept this premise, then to get the (S)-lactone, one must start with the (S)-acid. This leads to option D. There is no chemical basis for inversion of configuration, which would be required if B were (R) (Option B). Therefore, D is the most plausible intended answer, despite the chemical inaccuracy of the question's premise for the second reaction.\n\nFinal conclusion reached.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
