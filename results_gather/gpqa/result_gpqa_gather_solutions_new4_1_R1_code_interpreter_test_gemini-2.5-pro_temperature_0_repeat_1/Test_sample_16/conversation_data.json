Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant is very small. This implies that the complex is very stable and only a tiny amount will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant for Ca-EDTA (K_f) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The temperature is 25 °C and the pH is assumed to be ideal. An \"ideal pH\" implies that the EDTA is fully deprotonated (as Y⁴⁻), so we can use the given formation constant directly.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe given formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are interested in the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which result from the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nGiven that K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means the dissociation will be minimal, and 'x' will be a very small value compared to 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is in equilibrium. The complex is formed from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and the fully deprotonated form of EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The formation reaction is:\n\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, $K_f$ (also called the stability constant), which is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nSince we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it's more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n\n$CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation, $K_d$, is the inverse of the formation constant:\n\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. We are given that the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, $[CaY^{2-}]$, is 0.02 M. We assume the initial concentrations of the free ions are zero.

Solve for the Unknown Concentration (x)**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the complex is very stable. This means the dissociation is very slight, and 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make a simplifying approximation:\n\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-2})$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nTo find x, we take the square root:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n**4.

Understand the Chemistry**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n*   The problem gives the formation constant (also called the stability constant) for this reaction:\n    K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Set up the Equilibrium Calculation**\n\n*   We are starting with a solution that contains 0.02 M of the complex [CaY]²⁻. This complex will slightly dissociate to reach equilibrium. Therefore, it is more convenient to consider the *dissociation* reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Use an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species       | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺         | Y⁴⁻          |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M          | 0 M          |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x           | +x           |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x     | x            | x            |\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem states \"ideal pH\". This is a crucial simplification. The binding of EDTA is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough so that all free EDTA exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion. This allows us to use the given K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of EDTA.\n\n**4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\n\n*   The equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n*   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the dissociation constant K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small, the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n*   The simplified equation is:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n*   Solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    To make the exponent even, we can write this as:\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n*   From our ICE table, the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7. Verify the Assumption**\nIs x << 0.02?\n6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is much, much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2 x 10⁻²). The assumption was valid.\n\n**8.

Therefore, we can simplify the expression by assuming that (0.02 - x) is approximately equal to 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant (K_f) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The pH is ideal, which means we can assume that all EDTA not bound to calcium is in the EDTA⁴⁻ form.\n\nNow, let's set up an equilibrium calculation for the dissociation of the complex:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n*   **Initial concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n\n*   **Change in concentration:**\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation.\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] decreases by x.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] increases by x.\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] increases by x.\n\n*   **Equilibrium concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation of the complex will be minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

Understand the Chemical System and Given Information**\n*   We are given a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The chemical formula for this complex is [CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule.\n*   The initial concentration of the complex is [CaY]²⁻_initial = 0.02 M.\n*   The formation constant (stability constant) for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n*   The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". This is a crucial piece of information. EDTA's ability to bind metal ions is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) so that virtually all free EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, Y⁴⁻. This allows us to use the given formation constant K_f directly without needing to calculate a conditional formation constant (K'_f).\n\n**2. Write the Relevant Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe formation of the complex is described by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is:\nK_f = [ [CaY]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nSince we start with the complex, it will dissociate to a small extent to establish equilibrium. The relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation of the complex:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**3. Determine the Equilibrium Constant for Dissociation**\nThe dissociation constant, K_d, is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction. It is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f.\nK_d = 1 / K_f\nK_d = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**4. Set Up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Reaction      | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺ | Y⁴⁻  |\n|---------------|--------------|------|------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M  | 0 M  |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x   | +x   |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| (0.02 - x) M | x M  | x M  |\n\n**5. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\nNow, we use the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, with the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table.\nK_d = ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) / [ [CaY]²⁻ ]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**6. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹). This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**7. Solve for x**\nRearrange the equation to solve for x²:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root to find x:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nTo make the square root easier, we can write 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴:\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx = √40 * √(10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32 * 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**8.

Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully calculated the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions (`Ca²⁺`) from a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe calculation was based on the dissociation equilibrium `Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻` and its very large formation constant, `K_f = 5x10¹⁰`. By setting up the equilibrium expression `K_f ≈ 0.02 / x²`, where `x` is the concentration of `Ca²⁺`, the code solved for `x`.\n\nThe calculated concentration of `Ca²⁺` was `6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻) is described by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f (also called the stability constant), for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe problem, however, involves the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), sometimes called the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium. Since the dissociation stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of the free EDTA anion (Y⁴⁻) will also be 'x'.\n\n*   **Initial concentration of CaY²⁻:** 0.02 M\n*   **Equilibrium concentration of CaY²⁻:** 0.02 - x\n*   **Equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺:** x\n*   **Equilibrium concentration of Y⁴⁻:** x\n\nNow, we substitute these into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻] / [CaY²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the complex is very stable, and the amount of dissociation 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹)(0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D. The assumption that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02 is valid, as 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is significantly less than 0.02.\n\nIt is important to note that this calculation assumes an \"ideal pH\". The actual concentration of the fully deprotonated EDTA (Y⁴⁻) is highly dependent on the pH of the solution. At lower pH values, more of the EDTA would be in protonated forms, leading to a higher concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. However, based on the information given, this simplified calculation is appropriate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer**: My initial assessment is that this is a straightforward equilibrium calculation. The reaction is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. We are given the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant (Kf). I can calculate the dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Kf) and then use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which I interpret to mean that we don't need to worry about the protonation of EDTA and can assume the given Kf is the conditional formation constant under these ideal conditions.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your approach seems sound, as this is a typical complexometric equilibrium problem. The \"ideal pH\" simplification is common in academic questions to avoid the more complex calculations involving alpha fractions of EDTA, which are pH-dependent. My main concern is to ensure the correct application of the equilibrium formula and the validity of any simplifying assumptions. Specifically, after setting up the equation Kd = x² / (0.02 - x), you will likely assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02. We must verify this assumption after solving for x to ensure the result is accurate.\n\n**Decision**: I will proceed with the calculation as proposed. The consensus is that this is a standard equilibrium problem where the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the key process. I will calculate the dissociation constant, set up the equilibrium expression, solve for the calcium ion concentration, and then confirm that the simplifying assumption made during the calculation is valid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the equilibrium:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the dissociation constant (Kd):** The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10¹⁰. The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n    *   Initial concentration of Ca²⁺ = 0 M\n    *   Initial concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ = 0 M\n    *   At equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** Since Kd is very small, the dissociation is minimal, meaning x will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption:** The calculated value of x (6.32x10⁻⁷) is indeed significantly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.

This implies that the complex is very stable and only a tiny amount will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant for Ca-EDTA (K_f) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The temperature is 25 °C and the pH is assumed to be ideal. An \"ideal pH\" implies that the EDTA is fully deprotonated (as Y⁴⁻), so we can use the given formation constant directly.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe given formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are interested in the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which result from the dissociation of the complex.

Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. We are given that the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, $[CaY^{2-}]$, is 0.02 M. We assume the initial concentrations of the free ions are zero.

Understand the Chemistry**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n*   The problem gives the formation constant (also called the stability constant) for this reaction:\n    K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Set up the Equilibrium Calculation**\n\n*   We are starting with a solution that contains 0.02 M of the complex [CaY]²⁻. This complex will slightly dissociate to reach equilibrium. Therefore, it is more convenient to consider the *dissociation* reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3.

This is a crucial simplification. The binding of EDTA is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough so that all free EDTA exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion. This allows us to use the given K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of EDTA.\n\n**4.

Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the dissociation constant K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small, the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

The equilibrium reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The given constant is the formation constant ($K_f$), which is for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Setting up the problem:** Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ at equilibrium. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the complex at equilibrium will be its initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated: $[CaY^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$.\n\n4.  **Applying the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Approximation:** Because $K_f$ is a very large number, the dissociation of the complex is minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to 0.02 M. We can therefore simplify the expression by assuming $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solving for x:**\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\, M$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the EDTA anion)\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) is given as:\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [CaY]²⁻. This complex will dissociate into free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). Let's denote the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium as 'x'. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the remaining complex will be (0.02 - x).\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, meaning the amount of dissociation ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by assuming that (0.02 - x) is approximately equal to 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant (K_f) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n*   The pH is ideal, which means we can assume that all EDTA not bound to calcium is in the EDTA⁴⁻ form.\n\nNow, let's set up an equilibrium calculation for the dissociation of the complex:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n*   **Initial concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n\n*   **Change in concentration:**\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation.\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] decreases by x.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] increases by x.\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] increases by x.\n\n*   **Equilibrium concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation of the complex will be minimal.

Understand the Chemical System and Given Information**\n*   We are given a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The chemical formula for this complex is [CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule.\n*   The initial concentration of the complex is [CaY]²⁻_initial = 0.02 M.\n*   The formation constant (stability constant) for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n*   The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". This is a crucial piece of information. EDTA's ability to bind metal ions is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) so that virtually all free EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, Y⁴⁻. This allows us to use the given formation constant K_f directly without needing to calculate a conditional formation constant (K'_f).\n\n**2. Write the Relevant Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe formation of the complex is described by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is:\nK_f = [ [CaY]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nSince we start with the complex, it will dissociate to a small extent to establish equilibrium. The relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation of the complex:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**3. Determine the Equilibrium Constant for Dissociation**\nThe dissociation constant, K_d, is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction. It is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f.\nK_d = 1 / K_f\nK_d = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**4. Set Up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Reaction      | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺ | Y⁴⁻  |\n|---------------|--------------|------|------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M  | 0 M  |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x   | +x   |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| (0.02 - x) M | x M  | x M  |\n\n**5. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\nNow, we use the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, with the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table.\nK_d = ( [Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻] ) / [ [CaY]²⁻ ]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**6. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹). This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**7. Solve for x**\nRearrange the equation to solve for x²:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root to find x:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nTo make the square root easier, we can write 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴:\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx = √40 * √(10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32 * 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**8.

Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹)(0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D. The assumption that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02 is valid, as 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is significantly less than 0.02.\n\nIt is important to note that this calculation assumes an \"ideal pH\". The actual concentration of the fully deprotonated EDTA (Y⁴⁻) is highly dependent on the pH of the solution. At lower pH values, more of the EDTA would be in protonated forms, leading to a higher concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. However, based on the information given, this simplified calculation is appropriate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer**: My initial assessment is that this is a straightforward equilibrium calculation. The reaction is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex: [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. We are given the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant (Kf). I can calculate the dissociation constant (Kd = 1/Kf) and then use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. The problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which I interpret to mean that we don't need to worry about the protonation of EDTA and can assume the given Kf is the conditional formation constant under these ideal conditions.\n\n**Skeptic**: Your approach seems sound, as this is a typical complexometric equilibrium problem. The \"ideal pH\" simplification is common in academic questions to avoid the more complex calculations involving alpha fractions of EDTA, which are pH-dependent. My main concern is to ensure the correct application of the equilibrium formula and the validity of any simplifying assumptions. Specifically, after setting up the equation Kd = x² / (0.02 - x), you will likely assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02. We must verify this assumption after solving for x to ensure the result is accurate.\n\n**Decision**: I will proceed with the calculation as proposed. The consensus is that this is a standard equilibrium problem where the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the key process. I will calculate the dissociation constant, set up the equilibrium expression, solve for the calcium ion concentration, and then confirm that the simplifying assumption made during the calculation is valid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the equilibrium:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equation:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the dissociation constant (Kd):** The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10¹⁰. The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n    *   Initial concentration of Ca²⁺ = 0 M\n    *   Initial concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ = 0 M\n    *   At equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** Since Kd is very small, the dissociation is minimal, meaning x will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption:** The calculated value of x (6.32x10⁻⁷) is indeed significantly smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.
