The gravitational pull of an orbiting planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass. This wobble induces a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight, according to the Doppler effect formula:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    Where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n    This means the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, denoted as K, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n4.  **Use the Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)]\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   m_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems:** We can write the ratio K₂ / K₁ using the formula above:\n    K₂ / K₁ = { (2πG / P₂)^(1/3) * [m_p2 * sin(i₂) / M_star2^(2/3)] } / { (2πG / P₁)^(1/3) * [m_p1 * sin(i₁) / M_star1^(2/3)] }\n\n    This simplifies to:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3) * (m_p2 / m_p1) * (sin(i₂) / sin(i₁)) * (M_star1 / M_star2)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Apply the Given Conditions:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have exactly the same masses: M_star1 = M_star2.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n    *   Since the orbital inclinations (i) are not given, we make the reasonable assumption that they are similar for this comparison, so sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂).\n\n    Applying these conditions, the terms for mass and inclination cancel out:\n    *   (m_p2 / m_p1) ≈ 1\n    *   (sin(i₂) / sin(i₁)) ≈ 1\n    *   (M_star1 / M_star2)^(2/3) = 1\n\n    The equation simplifies significantly to:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₂ / P₁):**\n    We substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_star) towards or away from the observer. The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max₂ / Δλ_max₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) can be related to the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the orbital period (P). The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the conservation of momentum. A simplified and commonly used approximation (for m_p << M_star) is:\n\n    K ∝ (m_p / M_star^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3)\n\n    This shows that the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Two Systems:**\n    We are given that the two stars have identical masses (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the two planets have similar masses (m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂). We also assume that the orbital inclinations are similar, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. With these parameters being the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to:\n\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    We can now write the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value into the equation:\n\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n    1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.

Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be slightly blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between K and Δλ:\nK ∝ Δλ\n\nGiven the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nThe ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is derived from Kepler's Laws and the conservation of momentum. The full formula is:\n\nK = [ (2πG) / T ]^(1/3) * [ Mₚ / (Mₛ + Mₚ)^(2/3) ] * sin(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   Mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Simplify the Relationship for this Specific Problem**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n*   The planets have the same mass (Mₚ₁ = Mₚ₂).\n*   The problem does not specify different orbital inclinations, so we assume they are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). This is a standard assumption in such problems.\n\nSince G, Mₛ, Mₚ, and sin(i) are the same for both systems, we can see how K depends only on the orbital period, T:\n\nK ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = (1 / T₁^(1/3)) / (1 / T₂^(1/3))\nK₁ / K₂ = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)\n\nWe want to find the ratio T₂ / T₁.

Conclusion**\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\nThe star with the larger wavelength shift (Star 2) is moving faster, which implies its planet has a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, resulting in a shorter orbital period. Our result (T₂/T₁ < 1) is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as it and the planet orbit their common center of mass. This wobble causes the star's light to be blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away. The amplitude of this periodic shift in wavelength is the key piece of information.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_s$) of the star: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_s}{c}$.\n    *   The maximum periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as $K_s$.\n    *   Therefore, $K_s$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   We are given:\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom for planet #1's system.\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom for planet #2's system.\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude ($K_s$) and Orbital Period ($P$):**\n    *   The velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by the formula:\n        $K_s = \\frac{2 \\pi a_s \\sin(i)}{P}$\n        where $P$ is the orbital period, $a_s$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass, we have $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$, where $M_s$ and $m_p$ are the masses of the star and planet, and $a_p$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_s$), the planet's semi-major axis $a_p$ is nearly identical to the total separation $a$. So, we can write $a_s \\approx a \\frac{m_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   Now, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period $P$ to the semi-major axis $a$:\n        $P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$\n        Solving for $a$, we get $a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_s + m_p) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$. This shows that $a$ is proportional to $P^{2/3}$ ($a \\propto P^{2/3}$), since $G$, $M_s$, and $m_p$ are constants for a given system.\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for $a_s$ and $a$ back into the formula for $K_s$:\n        $K_s \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\propto \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} = P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **List Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   We have established the key relationship: $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   This proportionality holds because other factors are constant between the two systems. The problem states that the star masses ($M_s$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are the same.\n    *   We must also assume that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are the same for both systems. In the absence of information to the contrary, this is a standard assumption for such comparative problems.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   Using the proportionality $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}}\\right)^3$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{s1}}{K_{s2}}\\right)^3$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    *   Calculate the result:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes sense intuitively: a larger velocity wobble ($K_s$) for the same masses implies the planet is closer to the star, which, by Kepler's laws, means it must have a shorter orbital period. The result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, $T_2/T_1$. We are given information from Radial Velocity (RV) measurements.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between observables and physical parameters in the RV method.**\n\nThe RV method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is related to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, by the Doppler formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted by $K$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}}$\n\nGiven:\n$\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n$\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n**2. Relate the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (T).**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude of the star is given by:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\nwhere:\n*   $T$ is the orbital period.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p, 1} \\approx m_{p, 2}$. In the context of RV measurements, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. It is standard to assume this is the quantity being referred to, so we take $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n\n**3. Formulate the ratio of periods.**\n\nLet's write the ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$ using the formula:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(m_p \\sin i)_2}{M_{star, 2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(m_p \\sin i)_1}{M_{star, 1}^{2/3}}}$\n\nSince $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$ and $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$, these terms cancel out, along with the constant $2\\pi G$. The expression simplifies to:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/T_2)^{1/3}}{(1/T_1)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**4. Solve for the period ratio ($T_2/T_1$).**\n\nWe now have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n1.  From the wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$\n2.  From the physical formula: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nEquating these gives:\n$1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo solve for the desired ratio, $T_2/T_1$, we first cube both sides:\n$1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n$2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning and calculation are correct. The code output confirms the result.\n\nThe ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the final answer.\n\nThe relationship between the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) and the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is linear, meaning Δλ ∝ K. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude K for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * sin(i)\n\nIn this problem, the star masses (M_star) are the same, and the planet masses (M_p) are the same. Assuming the orbital inclinations (i) are similar, we can establish a proportionality between K and the orbital period T:\nK ∝ T⁻¹/³\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We can find this by taking the reciprocal:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line (Δλ) is caused by the star's motion as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This motion, projected along our line of sight, is the radial velocity (RV). The amplitude of the RV, denoted as K, is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    *   Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period.\n        *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n        *   M_star is the star's mass.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass, mₚ sin(i), is approximately the same for both planets. So, (mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂.\n\n    Because M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, they can be treated as constants in the comparison. The formula simplifies to a proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio between the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we can invert the equation:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the known values for the RV amplitudes (or the wavelength shifts):\n    *   5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for P₂ / P₁, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to find the ratio of their periods (P₂/P₁). This can be derived from the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the wavelength (Δλ) of a star's spectral line is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) caused by the orbiting planet. Therefore, the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift.\n    *   K₁ ∝ 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ 7 miliangstrom\n    *   This gives the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: K₁/K₂ = 5/7.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Applying the Principles to the Problem:\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass (mₚ sin(i)) is similar for both planets.\n*   Both orbits are circular.\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))` is approximately constant for both systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship between the semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\nK ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n### Calculation:\n\nWe can establish a ratio between the two systems:\nK₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁^(1/3)) / (1 / P₂^(1/3)) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\nCalculating the final value:\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the ratio of the orbital periods, we can use the formula for the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, K, which is the maximum velocity of the star along the line of sight.\n\nThe periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line is caused by the star's motion, as described by the Doppler effect. The maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude K:\n$K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\nGiven the periodic shifts for the two planets:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{P})^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n(assuming the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$, which is true for a Neptune-mass planet and a Sun-like star).\n\nHere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe are given that:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n\nThe problem does not provide the inclination angles (i). In such problems, it is a standard assumption that the unknown factors are comparable, so we assume $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$.\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(2\\pi G / P_1)^{1/3} \\cdot (m_{p1} \\sin i_1 / M_{star1}^{2/3})}{(2\\pi G / P_2)^{1/3} \\cdot (m_{p2} \\sin i_2 / M_{star2}^{2/3})}$\n\nUnder the given conditions and our assumption, most terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(1/P_1)^{1/3}}{(1/P_2)^{1/3}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of K:\n$\\frac{5}{7} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods ($P_2/P_1$), we cube both sides of the equation:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the ratio of the orbital periods.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This movement along our line of sight changes the wavelength of the light we observe from the star. The amplitude of this periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n\n*K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 milliangstrom / 7 milliangstrom = 5/7*\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **mₚ** is the mass of the planet.\n*   **Mₛ** is the mass of the star.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe term **mₚ sin(i)** is known as the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity that can be determined from RV measurements without knowing the inclination.\n\n### 3. Applying the Formula to the Two Systems\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   The planets were \"detected\" with \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, this implies that their minimum masses are similar: mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂).\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship between the radial velocity (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n\n*K ∝ P^(-1/3)*\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can establish a relationship between the two systems:\n\n*K₁ * P₁^(1/3) = K₂ * P₂^(1/3)*\n\nTo find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1 (P₂/P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n*(P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) = K₁ / K₂*\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio P₂ / P₁:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³*\n\nSubstituting the ratio of the radial velocities we found in the first step:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364*\n\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully calculated the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1.\n\nThe solution is based on the relationship derived from orbital mechanics for the radial velocity method. For constant star and planet masses, the star's maximum radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's orbital period (P) by K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³. Since the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to K, it follows that P ∝ (Δλ)⁻³.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods is P₂/P₁ = (Δλ₁/Δλ₂)³. Using the given values of Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ and Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ, the calculation yields (5/7)³, which is approximately 0.36. This result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe search results confirm the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, for a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0).\n\nFrom result, for a circular orbit (e=0) and m_p << m_S:\nm_p * sin(i) ≈ (P / 2πG)^(1/3) * K * m_S^(2/3)\n\nRearranging for K:\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / m_S^(2/3))\n\nThis confirms my initial formula. The semi-amplitude K is proportional to the maximum Doppler shift observed.\n\nThe key relationship derived from this formula is:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3) assuming all other parameters (m_p, m_S, sin(i)) are constant.\n\nFrom this, we can write the relationship for the period P:\nP ∝ K^(-3)\n\nNow, let's apply this to the two planetary systems. We are asked for the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)^(-3) = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nWe are given the periodic wavelength shifts, which are directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K).\n- Shift for planet #1 is up to 5 milliangstroms, so K₁ ∝ 5.\n- Shift for planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms, so K₂ ∝ 7.\n\nTherefore, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is 5 / 7.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36443\n\nThis calculation relies on the implicit assumption that the inclination angles (i) are the same for both systems, as the problem provides no information to the contrary and this is the only way to reach a determined answer among the choices. Given that the masses of the stars are identical and the masses of the planets are similar, this is a reasonable assumption for this type of problem.\n\nThe result ~0.36 matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Identify the relationship between the observable (wavelength shift) and the physical quantity (radial velocity semi-amplitude, K). They are directly proportional. Δλ ∝ K.\n2.  Identify the relationship between K and the orbital period P from the standard radial velocity formula. For circular orbits, K ∝ P^(-1/3), assuming other parameters are constant.\n3.  The problem states the stellar masses are identical (M₁ = M₂) and planetary masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2). The inclination angle (i) is the only other variable. Assuming i₁ ≈ i₂ is necessary to solve the problem.\n4.  Set up the ratio: P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3.\n5.  Substitute the values proportional to K: P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3.\n6.  Calculate the final value: 125 / 343 ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe logic holds.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n(5/7)^3 = 0.36443148688...\nThis is approximately 0.36.\n\nThe question asks \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\". This is the ratio P₂ / P₁. Since the ratio is less than 1, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.\n\nThe value is ~0.36. This corresponds to option A.\n\nFinal answer is A.\n\nTo be extremely thorough, let's write out the full ratio without any simplifications first:\nP₂ / P₁ = [ (2πG * (m_p2*sin(i₂))³ / (K₂³ * M_star2²)) ] / [ (2πG * (m_p1*sin(i₁))³ / (K₁³ * M_star1²)) ]\nP₂ / P₁ = (m_p2/m_p1)³ * (sin(i₂)/sin(i₁))³ * (M_star1/M_star2)² * (K₁/K₂)^3\n\nGiven information:\n- M_star1 = M_star2 -> (M_star1/M_star2)² = 1\n- m_p1 ≈ m_p2 -> (m_p2/m_p1)³ ≈ 1\n- K₁/K₂ = 5/7\n\nThis leaves:\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ (sin(i₂)/sin(i₁))³ * (5/7)³\n\nWithout assuming sin(i₂) = sin(i₁), the problem is unsolvable. The structure of the question and the answer choices strongly imply this assumption should be made. For example, if i₂ was 90 degrees (sin(i₂)=1) and i₁ was 30 degrees (sin(i₁)=0.5), the factor would be (1/0.5)³ = 8. This would drastically change the answer. However, in the absence of this information, assuming the systems are comparable (i.e., sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)) is the standard approach.\n\nTherefore, the calculation stands.\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe answer is A.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 0.36 -> (5/7)^3\nB) ~ 1.40 -> 7/5\nC) ~ 0.85 -> ?\nD) ~ 1.96 -> (7/5)^2\n\nOption B is simply the ratio of the velocity amplitudes K₂/K₁.\nOption D is the square of the ratio of the velocity amplitudes.\nOption A is the cube of the inverse ratio of the velocity amplitudes. This matches the derived formula P ∝ K⁻³.\n\nThe physics is sound. The interpretation of the problem seems correct.\n\nFinal answer is A.\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the planet's gravitational pull, its light is alternately blueshifted (when moving towards us) and redshifted (when moving away). The amount of wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   v_r ∝ Δλ\n    *   Therefore, K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Relate Given Information to K:** We are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems.\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms. So, K₁ ∝ 5.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms. So, K₂ ∝ 7.\n    *   This gives us the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n3.  **Use the Radial Velocity Formula:** The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   m_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Isolate the Orbital Period (P):** We need to find the relationship between the period (P) and the semi-amplitude (K). Let's rearrange the formula to solve for P.\n    *   K³ = (2πG / P) * (m_p * sin(i))³ / (M_star)²\n    *   P = (2πG * (m_p * sin(i))³ / (K³ * M_star²))\n\n5.  **Analyze the Relationship:** From the rearranged formula, we can see the proportionality between P and K, assuming other factors are constant.\n    *   P ∝ 1 / K³ or P ∝ K⁻³\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:** We need to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n7.  **Consider the Assumptions:** The problem states that the stellar masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planetary masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2). For the relationship P ∝ K⁻³ to hold, we must also assume that the orbital inclinations are similar (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)). This is a standard implicit assumption in such problems when no other information is given, and the existence of a matching answer choice confirms this approach.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes into the equation.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result ~0.36 indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n### Self-Debate and Final Answer\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets (T₂/T₁). The provided information includes the periodic wavelength shifts (Δλ) for each star, and the fact that the stars have identical masses and the planets have similar masses.\n\nThe proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  The periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect and is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂ is equal to the ratio K₁/K₂.\n2.  The star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is a function of the star's mass (M), the planet's mass (mₚ), and the semi-major axis of the orbit (a).\n3.  By establishing the relationship between K and 'a', we can use the known ratio of K₁/K₂ to find the ratio of a₂/a₁.\n4.  Using Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a) and the stellar mass (M), we can find the desired ratio T₂/T₁.\n\n**Skeptic:** This approach has potential flaws. First, the problem states the planets have \"similar\" masses, not identical ones. How does this ambiguity affect the result? Second, the measured radial velocity depends on the inclination of the orbit (sin *i*), which is unknown for both systems. If the inclinations are different, the ratio K₁/K₂ is not simply determined by the other orbital parameters.\n\n**Resolution:**\nThe multiple-choice format of the question suggests that a definitive answer can be reached. This implies that we should treat the \"similar\" masses as equal for the calculation. Any minor differences would lead to a result that is still approximately one of the given options. The issue of the unknown inclination angles is more significant. However, for the problem to be solvable, we must assume that the inclination angles are the same for both systems (or that the effect of inclination is already accounted for in the given shift values). Without this assumption, no solution is possible. Therefore, the debate converges on the conclusion that these idealizing assumptions are intended.\n\n### Derivation\nThe amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\nΔλ ∝ K\n\nFor a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:\nK ∝ (mₚ / √(Mₛₜₐᵣ)) * (1 / √a)\nwhere mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛₜₐᵣ is the star's mass, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\nGiven that mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂ and Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n\nSince Δλ ∝ K, we have:\nΔλ₁ / Δλ₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n5 / 7 = √(a₂ / a₁)\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² = 25 / 49\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the star (Mₛₜₐᵣ).\nT² ∝ a³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ\n\nThe ratio of the periods is therefore:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₂) / (a₁³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₁)\n\nSince Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, this simplifies to:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)³\nT₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\nSubstituting the value for a₂/a₁:\nT₂ / T₁ = ((5 / 7)²)^(3/2)\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Relationship between Observables and Physical Quantities\n\nThe problem is based on the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The key observable is the periodic shift in the wavelength of a star's spectral lines (Δλ).\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** This wavelength shift is caused by the star's motion towards and away from us (its radial velocity, v_r) as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet. The shift is directly proportional to the velocity.\n*   **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K):** The maximum radial velocity achieved by the star during its wobble is called the semi-amplitude, K. This corresponds to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n\nTherefore, the semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift Δλ_max.\n`K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n`K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4`\nor, inversely,\n`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n### 2. Relate Radial Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P)\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)]`\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `m_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Apply the Problem's Conditions and Assumptions\n\nThe problem states:\n*   The stars have the same mass: `M_star1 = M_star2`.\n*   The planets have similar masses: `m_p1 ≈ m_p2`.\n*   The problem does not provide the orbital inclinations (`i`). For a problem like this with a single correct answer among the choices, we must make the standard assumption that the systems are comparable, which means we assume `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`.\n\nWith these conditions, all terms in the formula except for `K` and `P` are constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n`K ∝ (1 / P)^(1/3)` or `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can use the proportionality to set up a ratio for the two systems:\n`K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\nThe question asks for the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for this. It's easier to start with the inverse ratio:\n`K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can solve for `P₂ / P₁` by cubing both sides:\n`P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\nSubstitute the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\n`P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\nCalculate the final value:\n`P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This result matches option A.\n\nA quick sanity check confirms this: Star #2 shows a larger velocity wobble (K₂ > K₁). For the same masses, this implies a stronger gravitational interaction, meaning planet #2 is closer to its star. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter period. Therefore, we expect `P₂ < P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` should be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This wobble induces a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight, according to the Doppler effect formula:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    Where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n    This means the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, denoted as K, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n4.  **Use the Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)]\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   m_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems:** We can write the ratio K₂ / K₁ using the formula above:\n    K₂ / K₁ = { (2πG / P₂)^(1/3) * [m_p2 * sin(i₂) / M_star2^(2/3)] } / { (2πG / P₁)^(1/3) * [m_p1 * sin(i₁) / M_star1^(2/3)] }\n\n    This simplifies to:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3) * (m_p2 / m_p1) * (sin(i₂) / sin(i₁)) * (M_star1 / M_star2)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Apply the Given Conditions:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have exactly the same masses: M_star1 = M_star2.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n    *   Since the orbital inclinations (i) are not given, we make the reasonable assumption that they are similar for this comparison, so sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂).\n\n    Applying these conditions, the terms for mass and inclination cancel out:\n    *   (m_p2 / m_p1) ≈ 1\n    *   (sin(i₂) / sin(i₁)) ≈ 1\n    *   (M_star1 / M_star2)^(2/3) = 1\n\n    The equation simplifies significantly to:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods (P₂ / P₁):**\n    We substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the period ratio, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_star) towards or away from the observer. The maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max₂ / Δλ_max₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) can be related to the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the orbital period (P). The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the conservation of momentum. A simplified and commonly used approximation (for m_p << M_star) is:\n\n    K ∝ (m_p / M_star^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3)\n\n    This shows that the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Two Systems:**\n    We are given that the two stars have identical masses (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the two planets have similar masses (m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂). We also assume that the orbital inclinations are similar, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. With these parameters being the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to:\n\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    We can now write the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. Substituting this value into the equation:\n\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n    1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.

Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be slightly blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between K and Δλ:\nK ∝ Δλ\n\nGiven the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nThe ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is derived from Kepler's Laws and the conservation of momentum. The full formula is:\n\nK = [ (2πG) / T ]^(1/3) * [ Mₚ / (Mₛ + Mₚ)^(2/3) ] * sin(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   Mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Simplify the Relationship for this Specific Problem**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n*   The planets have the same mass (Mₚ₁ = Mₚ₂).\n*   The problem does not specify different orbital inclinations, so we assume they are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). This is a standard assumption in such problems.\n\nSince G, Mₛ, Mₚ, and sin(i) are the same for both systems, we can see how K depends only on the orbital period, T:\n\nK ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = (1 / T₁^(1/3)) / (1 / T₂^(1/3))\nK₁ / K₂ = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)\n\nWe want to find the ratio T₂ / T₁. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(T₂ / T₁) = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nNow, substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 1:\n\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\nThe star with the larger wavelength shift (Star 2) is moving faster, which implies its planet has a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, resulting in a shorter orbital period. Our result (T₂/T₁ < 1) is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as it and the planet orbit their common center of mass. This wobble causes the star's light to be blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away. The amplitude of this periodic shift in wavelength is the key piece of information.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_s$) of the star: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_s}{c}$.\n    *   The maximum periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as $K_s$.\n    *   Therefore, $K_s$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   We are given:\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom for planet #1's system.\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom for planet #2's system.\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude ($K_s$) and Orbital Period ($P$):**\n    *   The velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by the formula:\n        $K_s = \\frac{2 \\pi a_s \\sin(i)}{P}$\n        where $P$ is the orbital period, $a_s$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass, we have $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$, where $M_s$ and $m_p$ are the masses of the star and planet, and $a_p$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_s$), the planet's semi-major axis $a_p$ is nearly identical to the total separation $a$. So, we can write $a_s \\approx a \\frac{m_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   Now, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period $P$ to the semi-major axis $a$:\n        $P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$\n        Solving for $a$, we get $a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_s + m_p) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$. This shows that $a$ is proportional to $P^{2/3}$ ($a \\propto P^{2/3}$), since $G$, $M_s$, and $m_p$ are constants for a given system.\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for $a_s$ and $a$ back into the formula for $K_s$:\n        $K_s \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\propto \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} = P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **List Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   We have established the key relationship: $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   This proportionality holds because other factors are constant between the two systems. The problem states that the star masses ($M_s$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are the same.\n    *   We must also assume that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are the same for both systems. In the absence of information to the contrary, this is a standard assumption for such comparative problems.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   Using the proportionality $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}}\\right)^3$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{s1}}{K_{s2}}\\right)^3$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    *   Calculate the result:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes sense intuitively: a larger velocity wobble ($K_s$) for the same masses implies the planet is closer to the star, which, by Kepler's laws, means it must have a shorter orbital period. The result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, $T_2/T_1$. We are given information from Radial Velocity (RV) measurements.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between observables and physical parameters in the RV method.**\n\nThe RV method measures the periodic Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is related to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, by the Doppler formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted by $K$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}}$\n\nGiven:\n$\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n$\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n**2. Relate the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (T).**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude of the star is given by:\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\nwhere:\n*   $T$ is the orbital period.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p, 1} \\approx m_{p, 2}$. In the context of RV measurements, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. It is standard to assume this is the quantity being referred to, so we take $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$.\n\n**3. Formulate the ratio of periods.**\n\nLet's write the ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$ using the formula:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(m_p \\sin i)_2}{M_{star, 2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{(m_p \\sin i)_1}{M_{star, 1}^{2/3}}}$\n\nSince $M_{star, 1} = M_{star, 2}$ and $(m_p \\sin i)_1 = (m_p \\sin i)_2$, these terms cancel out, along with the constant $2\\pi G$. The expression simplifies to:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/T_2)^{1/3}}{(1/T_1)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**4. Solve for the period ratio ($T_2/T_1$).**\n\nWe now have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n1.  From the wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$\n2.  From the physical formula: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nEquating these gives:\n$1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nTo solve for the desired ratio, $T_2/T_1$, we first cube both sides:\n$1.4^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n$2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe reasoning and calculation are correct. The code output confirms the result.\n\nThe ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the final answer.\n\nThe relationship between the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) and the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is linear, meaning Δλ ∝ K. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude K for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * sin(i)\n\nIn this problem, the star masses (M_star) are the same, and the planet masses (M_p) are the same. Assuming the orbital inclinations (i) are similar, we can establish a proportionality between K and the orbital period T:\nK ∝ T⁻¹/³\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We can find this by taking the reciprocal:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line (Δλ) is caused by the star's motion as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This motion, projected along our line of sight, is the radial velocity (RV). The amplitude of the RV, denoted as K, is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    *   Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period.\n        *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n        *   M_star is the star's mass.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass, mₚ sin(i), is approximately the same for both planets. So, (mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂.\n\n    Because M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, they can be treated as constants in the comparison. The formula simplifies to a proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio between the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we can invert the equation:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the known values for the RV amplitudes (or the wavelength shifts):\n    *   5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for P₂ / P₁, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to find the ratio of their periods (P₂/P₁). This can be derived from the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the wavelength (Δλ) of a star's spectral line is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) caused by the orbiting planet. Therefore, the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift.\n    *   K₁ ∝ 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ 7 miliangstrom\n    *   This gives the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: K₁/K₂ = 5/7.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Applying the Principles to the Problem:\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass (mₚ sin(i)) is similar for both planets.\n*   Both orbits are circular.\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))` is approximately constant for both systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship between the semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\nK ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n### Calculation:\n\nWe can establish a ratio between the two systems:\nK₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁^(1/3)) / (1 / P₂^(1/3)) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\nCalculating the final value:\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This movement along our line of sight changes the wavelength of the light we observe from the star. The amplitude of this periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n\n*K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 milliangstrom / 7 milliangstrom = 5/7*\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **mₚ** is the mass of the planet.\n*   **Mₛ** is the mass of the star.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe term **mₚ sin(i)** is known as the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity that can be determined from RV measurements without knowing the inclination.\n\n### 3. Applying the Formula to the Two Systems\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   The planets were \"detected\" with \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, this implies that their minimum masses are similar: mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂).\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship between the radial velocity (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n\n*K ∝ P^(-1/3)*\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can establish a relationship between the two systems:\n\n*K₁ * P₁^(1/3) = K₂ * P₂^(1/3)*\n\nTo find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1 (P₂/P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n*(P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) = K₁ / K₂*\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio P₂ / P₁:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³*\n\nSubstituting the ratio of the radial velocities we found in the first step:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364*\n\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully calculated the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1.\n\nThe solution is based on the relationship derived from orbital mechanics for the radial velocity method. For constant star and planet masses, the star's maximum radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's orbital period (P) by K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³. Since the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to K, it follows that P ∝ (Δλ)⁻³.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods is P₂/P₁ = (Δλ₁/Δλ₂)³. Using the given values of Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ and Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ, the calculation yields (5/7)³, which is approximately 0.36. This result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe search results confirm the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, for a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0).\n\nFrom result, for a circular orbit (e=0) and m_p << m_S:\nm_p * sin(i) ≈ (P / 2πG)^(1/3) * K * m_S^(2/3)\n\nRearranging for K:\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / m_S^(2/3))\n\nThis confirms my initial formula. The semi-amplitude K is proportional to the maximum Doppler shift observed.\n\nThe key relationship derived from this formula is:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3) assuming all other parameters (m_p, m_S, sin(i)) are constant.\n\nFrom this, we can write the relationship for the period P:\nP ∝ K^(-3)\n\nNow, let's apply this to the two planetary systems. We are asked for the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)^(-3) = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nWe are given the periodic wavelength shifts, which are directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K).\n- Shift for planet #1 is up to 5 milliangstroms, so K₁ ∝ 5.\n- Shift for planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms, so K₂ ∝ 7.\n\nTherefore, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is 5 / 7.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36443\n\nThis calculation relies on the implicit assumption that the inclination angles (i) are the same for both systems, as the problem provides no information to the contrary and this is the only way to reach a determined answer among the choices. Given that the masses of the stars are identical and the masses of the planets are similar, this is a reasonable assumption for this type of problem.\n\nThe result ~0.36 matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Identify the relationship between the observable (wavelength shift) and the physical quantity (radial velocity semi-amplitude, K). They are directly proportional. Δλ ∝ K.\n2.  Identify the relationship between K and the orbital period P from the standard radial velocity formula. For circular orbits, K ∝ P^(-1/3), assuming other parameters are constant.\n3.  The problem states the stellar masses are identical (M₁ = M₂) and planetary masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2). The inclination angle (i) is the only other variable. Assuming i₁ ≈ i₂ is necessary to solve the problem.\n4.  Set up the ratio: P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3.\n5.  Substitute the values proportional to K: P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3.\n6.  Calculate the final value: 125 / 343 ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe logic holds.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n(5/7)^3 = 0.36443148688...\nThis is approximately 0.36.\n\nThe question asks \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\". This is the ratio P₂ / P₁. Since the ratio is less than 1, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.\n\nThe value is ~0.36. This corresponds to option A.\n\nFinal answer is A.\n\nTo be extremely thorough, let's write out the full ratio without any simplifications first:\nP₂ / P₁ = [ (2πG * (m_p2*sin(i₂))³ / (K₂³ * M_star2²)) ] / [ (2πG * (m_p1*sin(i₁))³ / (K₁³ * M_star1²)) ]\nP₂ / P₁ = (m_p2/m_p1)³ * (sin(i₂)/sin(i₁))³ * (M_star1/M_star2)² * (K₁/K₂)^3\n\nGiven information:\n- M_star1 = M_star2 -> (M_star1/M_star2)² = 1\n- m_p1 ≈ m_p2 -> (m_p2/m_p1)³ ≈ 1\n- K₁/K₂ = 5/7\n\nThis leaves:\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ (sin(i₂)/sin(i₁))³ * (5/7)³\n\nWithout assuming sin(i₂) = sin(i₁), the problem is unsolvable. The structure of the question and the answer choices strongly imply this assumption should be made. For example, if i₂ was 90 degrees (sin(i₂)=1) and i₁ was 30 degrees (sin(i₁)=0.5), the factor would be (1/0.5)³ = 8. This would drastically change the answer. However, in the absence of this information, assuming the systems are comparable (i.e., sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)) is the standard approach.\n\nTherefore, the calculation stands.\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe answer is A.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 0.36 -> (5/7)^3\nB) ~ 1.40 -> 7/5\nC) ~ 0.85 -> ?\nD) ~ 1.96 -> (7/5)^2\n\nOption B is simply the ratio of the velocity amplitudes K₂/K₁.\nOption D is the square of the ratio of the velocity amplitudes.\nOption A is the cube of the inverse ratio of the velocity amplitudes. This matches the derived formula P ∝ K⁻³.\n\nThe physics is sound. The interpretation of the problem seems correct.\n\nFinal answer is A.\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the planet's gravitational pull, its light is alternately blueshifted (when moving towards us) and redshifted (when moving away). The amount of wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   v_r ∝ Δλ\n    *   Therefore, K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Relate Given Information to K:** We are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems.\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms. So, K₁ ∝ 5.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms. So, K₂ ∝ 7.\n    *   This gives us the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n3.  **Use the Radial Velocity Formula:** The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   m_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Isolate the Orbital Period (P):** We need to find the relationship between the period (P) and the semi-amplitude (K). Let's rearrange the formula to solve for P.\n    *   K³ = (2πG / P) * (m_p * sin(i))³ / (M_star)²\n    *   P = (2πG * (m_p * sin(i))³ / (K³ * M_star²))\n\n5.  **Analyze the Relationship:** From the rearranged formula, we can see the proportionality between P and K, assuming other factors are constant.\n    *   P ∝ 1 / K³ or P ∝ K⁻³\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:** We need to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n7.  **Consider the Assumptions:** The problem states that the stellar masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planetary masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2). For the relationship P ∝ K⁻³ to hold, we must also assume that the orbital inclinations are similar (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)). This is a standard implicit assumption in such problems when no other information is given, and the existence of a matching answer choice confirms this approach.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes into the equation.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result ~0.36 indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n### Self-Debate and Final Answer\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets (T₂/T₁). The provided information includes the periodic wavelength shifts (Δλ) for each star, and the fact that the stars have identical masses and the planets have similar masses.\n\nThe proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  The periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect and is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂ is equal to the ratio K₁/K₂.\n2.  The star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is a function of the star's mass (M), the planet's mass (mₚ), and the semi-major axis of the orbit (a).\n3.  By establishing the relationship between K and 'a', we can use the known ratio of K₁/K₂ to find the ratio of a₂/a₁.\n4.  Using Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a) and the stellar mass (M), we can find the desired ratio T₂/T₁.\n\n**Skeptic:** This approach has potential flaws. First, the problem states the planets have \"similar\" masses, not identical ones. How does this ambiguity affect the result? Second, the measured radial velocity depends on the inclination of the orbit (sin *i*), which is unknown for both systems. If the inclinations are different, the ratio K₁/K₂ is not simply determined by the other orbital parameters.\n\n**Resolution:**\nThe multiple-choice format of the question suggests that a definitive answer can be reached. This implies that we should treat the \"similar\" masses as equal for the calculation. Any minor differences would lead to a result that is still approximately one of the given options. The issue of the unknown inclination angles is more significant. However, for the problem to be solvable, we must assume that the inclination angles are the same for both systems (or that the effect of inclination is already accounted for in the given shift values). Without this assumption, no solution is possible. Therefore, the debate converges on the conclusion that these idealizing assumptions are intended.\n\n### Derivation\nThe amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\nΔλ ∝ K\n\nFor a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:\nK ∝ (mₚ / √(Mₛₜₐᵣ)) * (1 / √a)\nwhere mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛₜₐᵣ is the star's mass, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\nGiven that mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂ and Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n\nSince Δλ ∝ K, we have:\nΔλ₁ / Δλ₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n5 / 7 = √(a₂ / a₁)\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² = 25 / 49\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the star (Mₛₜₐᵣ).\nT² ∝ a³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ\n\nThe ratio of the periods is therefore:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₂) / (a₁³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₁)\n\nSince Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, this simplifies to:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)³\nT₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\nSubstituting the value for a₂/a₁:\nT₂ / T₁ = ((5 / 7)²)^(3/2)\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
