This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's spin is aligned along the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new axis of the magnetic field (+Y). The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B is given by H = -μ ⋅ B. Since the magnetic moment μ is related to the spin S by μ = γS (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ(S ⋅ B).\n\nWith the magnetic field B applied along the +Y direction (B = Bŷ), the Hamiltonian is H = -γB * S<sub>y</sub>.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of an operator, such as the z-component of the spin (S<sub>z</sub>), is described by the Heisenberg equation of motion:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, H]⟩\n\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian, we get:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, -γBS<sub>y</sub>]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>]⟩\n\nUsing the commutation relation for spin operators, [S<sub>y</sub>, S<sub>z</sub>] = iħS<sub>x</sub>, it follows that [S<sub>z</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>] = -iħS<sub>x</sub>.\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ)(-iħ⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩) = γB⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩\n\nTo find the oscillation, we need a second-order differential equation. We can find the time derivative of ⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩:\nd⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>x</sub>, H]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S<sub>x</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>]⟩\n\nUsing the commutation relation [S<sub>x</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>] = iħS<sub>z</sub>, we get:\nd⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ)(iħ⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩) = -γB⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩\n\nNow, by taking the time derivative of the equation for d⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt and substituting the expression for d⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt, we obtain:\nd²⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt² = γB(d⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt) = γB(-γB⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency of oscillation ω is γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nWhen a particle with a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin 1/2 particle has its magnetic moment aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y). The angular frequency of this precession is given by the Larmor equation:\n\nω = γB\n\nwhere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of precession.\n*   γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio, which is proportional to the particle's magnetic moment (μ = γS, where S is the spin angular momentum).\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nAs the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The initial orientation is along the Z-axis, and as it rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, the Z-component will vary sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment will oscillate with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession for a spin 1/2 particle. Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -(γS) · (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γB * S_y`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis operator `exp(i * θ * S_y / ħ)` represents a rotation of the state vector around the y-axis by an angle `θ = γB * t`. So, the initial spin state `|+z>` starts to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the y-axis).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of S_z\n\nWe want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γ * S_z`, this is equivalent to finding `<S_z(t)>`.\n\n`<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nWe can solve this using a few methods.\n\n**Method 1: The Heisenberg Picture**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time. The equation of motion for the operator `S_z` is:\n`d(S_z)/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_z, H_new] = (1/iħ) * [S_z, -γB * S_y] = (-γB/iħ) * [S_z, S_y]`\n\nUsing the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n`d(S_z)/dt = (-γB/iħ) * (-iħS_x) = γB * S_x`\n\nSimilarly, for `S_x`:\n`d(S_x)/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_x, -γB * S_y] = (-γB/iħ) * [S_x, S_y]`\nUsing `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`:\n`d(S_x)/dt = (-γB/iħ) * (iħS_z) = -γB * S_z`\n\nNow we have a pair of coupled differential equations. We can solve them by differentiating the first equation:\n`d²(S_z)/dt² = γB * d(S_x)/dt`\nSubstituting the second equation into this:\n`d²(S_z)/dt² = γB * (-γB * S_z) = -(γB)² * S_z`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²(S_z)/dt² + (γB)² * S_z = 0`.\nThe solution for this equation has the form `cos(ωt)` and `sin(ωt)`, where the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nLet's find the full solution for the expectation value:\nThe solution for the operator is `S_z(t) = S_z(0)cos(γBt) + S_x(0)sin(γBt)`.\nThe expectation value is `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(0)| S_z(t) |ψ(0)> = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`.\nThis gives `<S_z(t)> = cos(γBt)<+z|S_z|+z> + sin(γBt)<+z|S_x|+z>`.\nWe know `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2` and `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`.\nSo, `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n**Method 2: The Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)**\n\nA classical magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ x B`, which causes it to precess around the magnetic field vector. The equation of motion is `dμ/dt = γ(μ x B)`. This equation describes precession around `B` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`, known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nIn our case, the initial moment is along the Z-axis, and the field is along the Y-axis. The moment vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis. The z-component of the moment will vary as `μ_z(t) = μ_z(0) * cos(ωt)`. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the quantum mechanical calculation and the classical analogy show that the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates. The oscillation is described by a cosine function with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2.\n    *   A magnetic field `B` is applied in the `+Z` direction.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z B = -γ S_z B`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive (like for a positron), the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`. If `γ` were negative (like for an electron), the spin-down state would be lower energy, but the final result for the frequency remains the same. We will proceed assuming the initial state is `|+z>`.\n    *   So, at `t=0`, the state of the system is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **The Change (at t = 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, a \"sudden\" change means the process happens so quickly that the state vector of the system does not have time to change. Therefore, the state of the system immediately after the switch (at `t=0+`) is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n3.  **New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   For `t > 0`, the magnetic field is `B` in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B = -μ_y B = -γ S_y B`.\n\n4.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):**\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (since `S_z` and `S_y` do not commute). Therefore, the state is not stationary and will evolve in time.\n    *   The expectation value of any observable that does not commute with `H_new` will change with time. We are interested in `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`.\n    *   The time evolution of the system will be a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The frequency of oscillation of the expectation values is determined by the energy difference between the energy levels of `H_new`.\n\n5.  **Energy Levels of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   The energy levels of `H_new = -γ S_y B` are determined by the eigenvalues of the `S_y` operator.\n    *   The `S_y` operator has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n        *   `E'_1 = -γ B (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E'_2 = -γ B (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The energy difference (or splitting) between these two levels is:\n        `ΔE = E'_2 - E'_1 = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   For any two-level quantum system, if the state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the expectation values of observables will oscillate with an angular frequency `Ω` given by the Bohr frequency relation:\n        `Ω = ΔE / ħ`\n    *   Substituting the energy difference we found:\n        `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Sudden\" Approximation:** This is crucial. It establishes that the initial state for the new dynamics is the final state of the old dynamics (`|+z>`).\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\":** This specifies the initial state as the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   **Oscillation Frequency:** The question asks for the oscillation frequency. In this context, it refers to the angular frequency `Ω` (in radians per second), not the linear frequency `f = Ω/2π`. The units of the given options confirm this.\n*   **Larmor Precession:** This result is a direct consequence of Larmor precession. A magnetic moment in a magnetic field precesses around the field direction with the Larmor frequency, `Ω_L = γB`. Here, the initial spin is along Z, and the field is along Y, so the spin vector (and its expectation value) precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis with frequency `γB`. The Z-component of the spin will therefore oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe oscillation frequency `Ω` is determined by the energy splitting `ΔE` of the new Hamiltonian `H_new = -γ S_y B`.\n1.  Energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are `E = -γB * (eigenvalues of S_y)`.\n2.  Eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n3.  Energy levels are `E_1 = -γBħ/2` and `E_2 = +γBħ/2`.\n4.  Energy splitting is `ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = γBħ`.\n5.  Oscillation frequency is `Ω = ΔE / ħ = γBħ / ħ = γB`.\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment will oscillate with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem describes the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment in a magnetic field.\n\n### **1. Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   A magnetic field `B` is applied in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (energy `E = -γBħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (energy `E = +γBħ/2`). Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `|+z>`.\n*   So, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. At this moment, the spin is pointing entirely in the +Z direction.\n\n### **2. New Dynamics (t > 0)**\n\n*   At `t=0`, the field is switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB S_y`.\n*   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the state will evolve over time.\n*   The time evolution of the spin vector is a precession (rotation) around the axis of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis).\n\n### **3. Calculating the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe frequency of this rotation is known as the **Larmor frequency**, `Ω_L`, and it is given by the formula `Ω_L = γB`.\n\nLet's derive this result more formally. We want to find the oscillation frequency of `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`. We can calculate the time evolution of the expectation value `<S_z>(t)`.\n\nThe state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z>`.\nThe expectation value is `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)> = <+z|exp(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z>`.\n\nThe operator `S_z(t) = exp(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)` is the `S_z` operator in the Heisenberg picture. It represents the rotation of the `S_z` operator around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The transformation for vector operators under rotation is:\n`S_z(t) = S_z cos(θ) - S_x sin(θ) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`\n\nNow we compute the expectation value of `S_z(t)` in the initial state `|+z>`:\n`<S_z>(t) = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(γBt)<+z|S_z|+z> - sin(γBt)<+z|S_x|+z>`\n\nFor the spin-up state `|+z>`, we know the expectation values:\n*   `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2`\n*   `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`\n\nSubstituting these gives:\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThis expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A function of the form `A cos(Ωt)` has an angular frequency of `Ω`. By comparing this to our result, we can see the oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use a simple symbolic script.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for the physical quantities.\ngamma, B, t = sympy.symbols('gamma B t', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# The time-dependent part of the expectation value is cos(gamma * B * t).\n# The general form of an oscillation is cos(Omega * t), where Omega is the angular frequency.\n# The argument of the cosine function is:\nargument = gamma * B * t\n\n# The oscillation frequency, Omega, is the coefficient of the time variable 't'.\n# We can extract it by dividing the argument by t.\noscillation_frequency = argument / t\n\n# Print the resulting frequency.\nprint(oscillation_frequency)\n```\nThe code output `B*gamma` confirms that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: B*gamma\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe user has provided the output from the code execution.\n**Code Output:** `hbar*cos(omega*t)/2`\n**Errors:** None\n\nThis output represents the expectation value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum, `<S_z>(t)`.\nLet's analyze this result.\n\n1.  The code was set up with `omega = gamma*B`.\n2.  The code calculated `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n3.  The result is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n4.  The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's *moment*, which is `<μ_z>(t)`.\n5.  The relationship between the magnetic moment `μ` and the spin `S` is `μ = γS`. Therefore, `μ_z = γS_z`.\n6.  The expectation value is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n7.  Substituting `ω = γB`, we get `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n8.  This expression describes an oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `(γB)t`. The general form for an oscillation is `cos(f*t)`, where `f` is the angular frequency.\n9.  By comparing the two forms, we can see that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nThis matches the result derived in the initial reasoning. The entire process is consistent.\n\nThe initial state is the spin-up state along the z-axis, `|+z>`. The new Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y` causes the spin to precess around the y-axis. The projection of the precessing spin onto the z-axis will oscillate. The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, which is `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_y`. This Hamiltonian will govern the time evolution of the system.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. Since the new Hamiltonian `H` is time-independent, the state at a later time `t` is given by:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    *   We need to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The oscillation of `<μ_z(t)>` will have the same frequency as the oscillation of `<S_z(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Method 1: Using Energy Eigenstates (Bohr Frequency)**\n    *   A quantum system in a superposition of two energy eigenstates, `E_1` and `E_2`, will have its expectation values oscillate at an angular frequency `ω` given by the Bohr frequency relation: `ω = |E_2 - E_1| / ħ`.\n    *   Let's find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian, `H = -γB S_y`. The energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of the `S_y` operator.\n    *   The `S_y` operator has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of `H` are:\n        *   `E_1 = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E_2 = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H`. It is a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y`. (Specifically, `|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2`).\n    *   Because the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the system will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference `ΔE`.\n    *   `ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n5.  **Method 2: Direct Calculation (Larmor Precession)**\n    *   This problem describes Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field direction (`Y-axis` in this case) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n    *   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB`.\n    *   Initially, the spin vector points along the Z-axis: `<S(0)> = (0, 0, ħ/2)`.\n    *   Under the influence of the Y-directed magnetic field, this vector will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n    *   The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis will be:\n        `<S_z(t)> = |<S(0)>| cos(ω_L t) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is a cosine oscillation. By comparing it to the standard form `A cos(ωt)`, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

From the resulting expression, identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Initial State:** The particle is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means it is in the spin-up eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. Let's denote this state as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]^T` and `|-z> = [0, 1]^T`, the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = [1, 0]^T`.\n\n    2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, `B_vec = B * y_hat`. The Hamiltonian `H` for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B_vec` is `H = -μ · B_vec`. Since `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γ(S · B_vec) = -γB * Sy`.\n        The spin-y operator is `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy`, where `σy` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n        So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) * σy`.\n\n    3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i[-γB(ħ/2)σy]t/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy) |ψ(0)>`\n        To evaluate the matrix exponential, we use the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = γBt/2` and `k=y`.\n        `exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy) = cos(γBt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n        `= [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n        `= [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n        Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [1, 0]^T`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [1, 0]^T`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        In ket notation: `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`.\n\n    4.  **Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz> = γ<Sz>`. Let's first calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n        The `Sz` operator is `Sz = (ħ/2)σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n        `<Sz>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        `<Sz>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n        Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n    5.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n        This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A*cos(ωt)`. By comparing the two, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n        `ω = γB`\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nWhen a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is in a magnetic field **B**, the Hamiltonian of the system is given by H = -**μ** · **B**.

The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the S<sub>z</sub> operator, let's say \"spin up\". At this point, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>>, is at its maximum positive value.\n\nSuddenly, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian changes to H = -γB*S<sub>y</sub>. The spin, which was pointing in the Z direction, is no longer aligned with the magnetic field. It will therefore begin to precess around the new direction of the magnetic field, which is the Y-axis.\n\nThis precession occurs in the plane perpendicular to the new magnetic field, which is the X-Z plane.

This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin of the particle is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B is given by H = -μ ⋅ B. Given that the magnetic moment μ is proportional to the spin operator S (μ = γS), and the new magnetic field is B in the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB * S_y, where S_y is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <S_z>, will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula ω = γB. In this equation, ω is the angular frequency of precession, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment will oscillate with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has spin aligned with the +Z direction. In quantum mechanics, this state is represented by the eigenvector of the spin operator in the z-direction, `Sz`, corresponding to the eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. We denote this state as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian of the Interaction:** The energy of a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS` (where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`.\n\n3.  **Sudden Change in Magnetic Field:** Initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction. Suddenly, it is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. For `t > 0`, the new Hamiltonian is:\n    `H = -γ(S_x * B_x + S_y * B_y + S_z * B_z) = -γS_y * B`\n\n4.  **Time Evolution of the State:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a time `t`, `|ψ(t)>`, is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`. This is given by `<μz>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to calculating `γ<S_z>(t)`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = <+z| exp(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n    This expression describes the precession of the spin vector around the y-axis. The expectation value of `S_z` will oscillate as the spin vector, initially pointing along the z-axis, rotates in the x-z plane.\n\n6.  **Larmor Precession:** This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, known as the Larmor frequency, is given by `ω = γB`.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz>(t)`, will oscillate with this angular frequency. A detailed calculation shows that `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. Consequently, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the coefficient of `t` in the argument of the cosine function, which is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.

Therefore, the initial state of the particle is the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    *   Initial state: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **The Change (at t = 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field `B_f = B * j_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n    *   \"Suddenly\" implies that the state of the system does not have time to change. So, at the instant `t=0`, the state is still `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (for t > 0):**\n    *   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian, `H_f`.\n    *   `H_f = -μ · B_f = - (γS) · (B * j_hat) = -γBS_y`.\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the time evolution operator acting on the initial state:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_f * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n    *   This operator `exp(i * θ * S_y / ħ)` represents a rotation of the state vector around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z>(t)`.\n    *   Let's calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   We can express the initial state `|+z>` in the basis of `S_y` eigenstates. The eigenstates of `S_y` are:\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`\n    *   Inverting these, we get `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n    *   So, `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n    *   The time evolution of the `S_y` eigenstates is simple:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH_f t/ħ) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_y^+ t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_y^- t/ħ)|-y>]`\n        where `E_y^+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_y^- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>]`\n    *   Now we calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`. We need to express `S_z` in the `S_y` basis, or convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the `S_z` basis. Let's do the latter.\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)) + exp(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>))]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (exp(iγBt/2) + exp(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iγBt/2) - exp(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n        Using Euler's formulas: `cos(x) = (e^{ix}+e^{-ix})/2` and `sin(x) = (e^{ix}-e^{-ix})/(2i)`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now, we compute the expectation value of `S_z`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `= (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n        `= (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z> + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z> )`\n        `= (ħ/2) * [cos^2(γBt/2) - sin^2(γBt/2)]`\n        Using the double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)`, this becomes:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Finding the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation.

The Hamiltonian is given by H = -**μ** · **B**. Since **μ** = γ**S** (where **S** is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio) and **B** is now B**ŷ** (a vector of magnitude B in the Y direction), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB * Sy, where Sy is the spin operator in the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle, |ψ(t)>, evolves over time according to the Schrödinger equation.

    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics concerning Larmor precession. Let's break down the problem to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n    *   The particle is in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle's moment is \"aligned with the field,\" which means it occupies the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Dynamics (t ≥ 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to the `+Y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The \"sudden\" approximation in quantum mechanics means the state of the system does not have time to change during the switch. So, the state at `t=0+` is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution and Oscillation:**\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (because the operators `S_z` and `S_y` do not commute).\n    *   Therefore, the state is not stationary and will evolve in time. The expectation value of observables that do not commute with `H_new`, such as `S_z`, will oscillate.\n    *   The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`. This frequency is determined by the dynamics under `H_new`.\n\n### Methods to Find the Frequency\n\nThere are two common and reliable ways to find this frequency.\n\n**Method 1: Larmor Precession**\nThe physical phenomenon described is Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\nThe Larmor frequency is given by the formula:\n`ω_L = γB`\nIn this problem, the initial spin is along the Z-axis, and the new field is along the Y-axis. The spin vector will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. As it rotates, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency, `γB`.\n\n**Method 2: Bohr Frequency from Energy Splitting**\nIn a two-level quantum system, if the state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the expectation values of observables will oscillate with an angular frequency `ω` given by the energy difference `ΔE` between the levels:\n`ω = ΔE / ħ`\nLet's find the energy levels for our new Hamiltonian, `H_new = -γB S_y`.\n*   The eigenvalues of the `S_y` operator are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are therefore `E_1 = -γB(+ħ/2)` and `E_2 = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The energy difference (splitting) between these two levels is `ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n*   The oscillation frequency is `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods unambiguously show that the angular frequency of oscillation is `γB`.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\nA vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly identify the physics of Larmor precession and derive the oscillation frequency as `γB`.

This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's spin is aligned along the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new axis of the magnetic field (+Y). The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B is given by H = -μ ⋅ B. Since the magnetic moment μ is related to the spin S by μ = γS (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ(S ⋅ B).\n\nWith the magnetic field B applied along the +Y direction (B = Bŷ), the Hamiltonian is H = -γB * S<sub>y</sub>.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of an operator, such as the z-component of the spin (S<sub>z</sub>), is described by the Heisenberg equation of motion:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, H]⟩\n\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian, we get:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, -γBS<sub>y</sub>]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S<sub>z</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>]⟩\n\nUsing the commutation relation for spin operators, [S<sub>y</sub>, S<sub>z</sub>] = iħS<sub>x</sub>, it follows that [S<sub>z</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>] = -iħS<sub>x</sub>.\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\nd⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ)(-iħ⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩) = γB⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩\n\nTo find the oscillation, we need a second-order differential equation. We can find the time derivative of ⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩:\nd⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[S<sub>x</sub>, H]⟩ = (-γB/iħ)⟨[S<sub>x</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>]⟩\n\nUsing the commutation relation [S<sub>x</sub>, S<sub>y</sub>] = iħS<sub>z</sub>, we get:\nd⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt = (-γB/iħ)(iħ⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩) = -γB⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩\n\nNow, by taking the time derivative of the equation for d⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt and substituting the expression for d⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt, we obtain:\nd²⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩/dt² = γB(d⟨S<sub>x</sub>⟩/dt) = γB(-γB⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S<sub>z</sub>⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency of oscillation ω is γB. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nWhen a particle with a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes the magnetic moment to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin 1/2 particle has its magnetic moment aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y). The angular frequency of this precession is given by the Larmor equation:\n\nω = γB\n\nwhere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of precession.\n*   γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio, which is proportional to the particle's magnetic moment (μ = γS, where S is the spin angular momentum).\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nAs the magnetic moment vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The initial orientation is along the Z-axis, and as it rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, the Z-component will vary sinusoidally. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment will oscillate with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession for a spin 1/2 particle. Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -(γS) · (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γB * S_y`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis operator `exp(i * θ * S_y / ħ)` represents a rotation of the state vector around the y-axis by an angle `θ = γB * t`. So, the initial spin state `|+z>` starts to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the y-axis).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of S_z\n\nWe want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γ * S_z`, this is equivalent to finding `<S_z(t)>`.\n\n`<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nWe can solve this using a few methods.\n\n**Method 1: The Heisenberg Picture**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time. The equation of motion for the operator `S_z` is:\n`d(S_z)/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_z, H_new] = (1/iħ) * [S_z, -γB * S_y] = (-γB/iħ) * [S_z, S_y]`\n\nUsing the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n`d(S_z)/dt = (-γB/iħ) * (-iħS_x) = γB * S_x`\n\nSimilarly, for `S_x`:\n`d(S_x)/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_x, -γB * S_y] = (-γB/iħ) * [S_x, S_y]`\nUsing `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`:\n`d(S_x)/dt = (-γB/iħ) * (iħS_z) = -γB * S_z`\n\nNow we have a pair of coupled differential equations. We can solve them by differentiating the first equation:\n`d²(S_z)/dt² = γB * d(S_x)/dt`\nSubstituting the second equation into this:\n`d²(S_z)/dt² = γB * (-γB * S_z) = -(γB)² * S_z`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²(S_z)/dt² + (γB)² * S_z = 0`.\nThe solution for this equation has the form `cos(ωt)` and `sin(ωt)`, where the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nLet's find the full solution for the expectation value:\nThe solution for the operator is `S_z(t) = S_z(0)cos(γBt) + S_x(0)sin(γBt)`.\nThe expectation value is `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(0)| S_z(t) |ψ(0)> = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`.\nThis gives `<S_z(t)> = cos(γBt)<+z|S_z|+z> + sin(γBt)<+z|S_x|+z>`.\nWe know `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2` and `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`.\nSo, `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n**Method 2: The Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)**\n\nA classical magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ x B`, which causes it to precess around the magnetic field vector. The equation of motion is `dμ/dt = γ(μ x B)`. This equation describes precession around `B` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`, known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nIn our case, the initial moment is along the Z-axis, and the field is along the Y-axis. The moment vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis. The z-component of the moment will vary as `μ_z(t) = μ_z(0) * cos(ωt)`. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the quantum mechanical calculation and the classical analogy show that the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates. The oscillation is described by a cosine function with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2.\n    *   A magnetic field `B` is applied in the `+Z` direction.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z B = -γ S_z B`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive (like for a positron), the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`. If `γ` were negative (like for an electron), the spin-down state would be lower energy, but the final result for the frequency remains the same. We will proceed assuming the initial state is `|+z>`.\n    *   So, at `t=0`, the state of the system is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **The Change (at t = 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, a \"sudden\" change means the process happens so quickly that the state vector of the system does not have time to change. Therefore, the state of the system immediately after the switch (at `t=0+`) is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n3.  **New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   For `t > 0`, the magnetic field is `B` in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B = -μ_y B = -γ S_y B`.\n\n4.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):**\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (since `S_z` and `S_y` do not commute). Therefore, the state is not stationary and will evolve in time.\n    *   The expectation value of any observable that does not commute with `H_new` will change with time. We are interested in `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`.\n    *   The time evolution of the system will be a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The frequency of oscillation of the expectation values is determined by the energy difference between the energy levels of `H_new`.\n\n5.  **Energy Levels of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   The energy levels of `H_new = -γ S_y B` are determined by the eigenvalues of the `S_y` operator.\n    *   The `S_y` operator has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n        *   `E'_1 = -γ B (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E'_2 = -γ B (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The energy difference (or splitting) between these two levels is:\n        `ΔE = E'_2 - E'_1 = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   For any two-level quantum system, if the state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the expectation values of observables will oscillate with an angular frequency `Ω` given by the Bohr frequency relation:\n        `Ω = ΔE / ħ`\n    *   Substituting the energy difference we found:\n        `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Sudden\" Approximation:** This is crucial. It establishes that the initial state for the new dynamics is the final state of the old dynamics (`|+z>`).\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\":** This specifies the initial state as the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   **Oscillation Frequency:** The question asks for the oscillation frequency. In this context, it refers to the angular frequency `Ω` (in radians per second), not the linear frequency `f = Ω/2π`. The units of the given options confirm this.\n*   **Larmor Precession:** This result is a direct consequence of Larmor precession. A magnetic moment in a magnetic field precesses around the field direction with the Larmor frequency, `Ω_L = γB`. Here, the initial spin is along Z, and the field is along Y, so the spin vector (and its expectation value) precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis with frequency `γB`. The Z-component of the spin will therefore oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe oscillation frequency `Ω` is determined by the energy splitting `ΔE` of the new Hamiltonian `H_new = -γ S_y B`.\n1.  Energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are `E = -γB * (eigenvalues of S_y)`.\n2.  Eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n3.  Energy levels are `E_1 = -γBħ/2` and `E_2 = +γBħ/2`.\n4.  Energy splitting is `ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = γBħ`.\n5.  Oscillation frequency is `Ω = ΔE / ħ = γBħ / ħ = γB`.\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment will oscillate with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem describes the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment in a magnetic field.\n\n### **1. Initial State (t < 0)**\n\n*   The particle has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   A magnetic field `B` is applied in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (energy `E = -γBħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (energy `E = +γBħ/2`). Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `|+z>`.\n*   So, the initial state of the particle is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. At this moment, the spin is pointing entirely in the +Z direction.\n\n### **2. New Dynamics (t > 0)**\n\n*   At `t=0`, the field is switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB S_y`.\n*   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of this new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the state will evolve over time.\n*   The time evolution of the spin vector is a precession (rotation) around the axis of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis).\n\n### **3. Calculating the Oscillation Frequency**\n\nThe frequency of this rotation is known as the **Larmor frequency**, `Ω_L`, and it is given by the formula `Ω_L = γB`.\n\nLet's derive this result more formally. We want to find the oscillation frequency of `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`. We can calculate the time evolution of the expectation value `<S_z>(t)`.\n\nThe state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z>`.\nThe expectation value is `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)> = <+z|exp(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z>`.\n\nThe operator `S_z(t) = exp(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)` is the `S_z` operator in the Heisenberg picture. It represents the rotation of the `S_z` operator around the Y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The transformation for vector operators under rotation is:\n`S_z(t) = S_z cos(θ) - S_x sin(θ) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`\n\nNow we compute the expectation value of `S_z(t)` in the initial state `|+z>`:\n`<S_z>(t) = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n`<S_z>(t) = cos(γBt)<+z|S_z|+z> - sin(γBt)<+z|S_x|+z>`\n\nFor the spin-up state `|+z>`, we know the expectation values:\n*   `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2`\n*   `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`\n\nSubstituting these gives:\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThis expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A function of the form `A cos(Ωt)` has an angular frequency of `Ω`. By comparing this to our result, we can see the oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use a simple symbolic script.\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for the physical quantities.\ngamma, B, t = sympy.symbols('gamma B t', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# The time-dependent part of the expectation value is cos(gamma * B * t).\n# The general form of an oscillation is cos(Omega * t), where Omega is the angular frequency.\n# The argument of the cosine function is:\nargument = gamma * B * t\n\n# The oscillation frequency, Omega, is the coefficient of the time variable 't'.\n# We can extract it by dividing the argument by t.\noscillation_frequency = argument / t\n\n# Print the resulting frequency.\nprint(oscillation_frequency)\n```\nThe code output `B*gamma` confirms that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: B*gamma\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe user has provided the output from the code execution.\n**Code Output:** `hbar*cos(omega*t)/2`\n**Errors:** None\n\nThis output represents the expectation value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum, `<S_z>(t)`.\nLet's analyze this result.\n\n1.  The code was set up with `omega = gamma*B`.\n2.  The code calculated `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n3.  The result is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n4.  The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's *moment*, which is `<μ_z>(t)`.\n5.  The relationship between the magnetic moment `μ` and the spin `S` is `μ = γS`. Therefore, `μ_z = γS_z`.\n6.  The expectation value is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\n7.  Substituting `ω = γB`, we get `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n8.  This expression describes an oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `(γB)t`. The general form for an oscillation is `cos(f*t)`, where `f` is the angular frequency.\n9.  By comparing the two forms, we can see that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nThis matches the result derived in the initial reasoning. The entire process is consistent.\n\nThe initial state is the spin-up state along the z-axis, `|+z>`. The new Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y` causes the spin to precess around the y-axis. The projection of the precessing spin onto the z-axis will oscillate. The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, which is `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_y`. This Hamiltonian will govern the time evolution of the system.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution:**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. Since the new Hamiltonian `H` is time-independent, the state at a later time `t` is given by:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    *   We need to find the expectation value (average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The oscillation of `<μ_z(t)>` will have the same frequency as the oscillation of `<S_z(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Method 1: Using Energy Eigenstates (Bohr Frequency)**\n    *   A quantum system in a superposition of two energy eigenstates, `E_1` and `E_2`, will have its expectation values oscillate at an angular frequency `ω` given by the Bohr frequency relation: `ω = |E_2 - E_1| / ħ`.\n    *   Let's find the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the new Hamiltonian, `H = -γB S_y`. The energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of the `S_y` operator.\n    *   The `S_y` operator has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of `H` are:\n        *   `E_1 = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E_2 = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H`. It is a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y`. (Specifically, `|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2`).\n    *   Because the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the system will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is determined by the energy difference `ΔE`.\n    *   `ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n    *   The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n5.  **Method 2: Direct Calculation (Larmor Precession)**\n    *   This problem describes Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field direction (`Y-axis` in this case) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n    *   The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB`.\n    *   Initially, the spin vector points along the Z-axis: `<S(0)> = (0, 0, ħ/2)`.\n    *   Under the influence of the Y-directed magnetic field, this vector will precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n    *   The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis will be:\n        `<S_z(t)> = |<S(0)>| cos(ω_L t) = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is a cosine oscillation. By comparing it to the standard form `A cos(ωt)`, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession.

From the resulting expression, identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Initial State:** The particle is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means it is in the spin-up eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. Let's denote this state as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]^T` and `|-z> = [0, 1]^T`, the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = [1, 0]^T`.\n\n    2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, `B_vec = B * y_hat`. The Hamiltonian `H` for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B_vec` is `H = -μ · B_vec`. Since `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γ(S · B_vec) = -γB * Sy`.\n        The spin-y operator is `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy`, where `σy` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n        So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) * σy`.\n\n    3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i[-γB(ħ/2)σy]t/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy) |ψ(0)>`\n        To evaluate the matrix exponential, we use the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = γBt/2` and `k=y`.\n        `exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy) = cos(γBt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n        `= [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n        `= [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n        Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [1, 0]^T`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [1, 0]^T`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        In ket notation: `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`.\n\n    4.  **Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz> = γ<Sz>`. Let's first calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n        The `Sz` operator is `Sz = (ħ/2)σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n        `<Sz>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        `<Sz>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n        Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n    5.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n        This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A*cos(ωt)`. By comparing the two, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n        `ω = γB`\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nWhen a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is in a magnetic field **B**, the Hamiltonian of the system is given by H = -**μ** · **B**. The time evolution of the spin is governed by the torque equation d**S**/dt = **μ** x **B**, which leads to the precession of the spin vector **S** (and thus the magnetic moment **μ**) around the direction of the magnetic field. The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the S<sub>z</sub> operator, let's say \"spin up\". At this point, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>>, is at its maximum positive value.\n\nSuddenly, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian changes to H = -γB*S<sub>y</sub>. The spin, which was pointing in the Z direction, is no longer aligned with the magnetic field. It will therefore begin to precess around the new direction of the magnetic field, which is the Y-axis.\n\nThis precession occurs in the plane perpendicular to the new magnetic field, which is the X-Z plane. As the magnetic moment vector rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate.

This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the spin of the particle is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B is given by H = -μ ⋅ B. Given that the magnetic moment μ is proportional to the spin operator S (μ = γS), and the new magnetic field is B in the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB * S_y, where S_y is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <S_z>, will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula ω = γB. In this equation, ω is the angular frequency of precession, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment will oscillate with a frequency of γB.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has spin aligned with the +Z direction. In quantum mechanics, this state is represented by the eigenvector of the spin operator in the z-direction, `Sz`, corresponding to the eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. We denote this state as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian of the Interaction:** The energy of a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B`. Since the magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS` (where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`.\n\n3.  **Sudden Change in Magnetic Field:** Initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction. Suddenly, it is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. For `t > 0`, the new Hamiltonian is:\n    `H = -γ(S_x * B_x + S_y * B_y + S_z * B_z) = -γS_y * B`\n\n4.  **Time Evolution of the State:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a time `t`, `|ψ(t)>`, is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, we get:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`. This is given by `<μz>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to calculating `γ<S_z>(t)`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = <+z| exp(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n    This expression describes the precession of the spin vector around the y-axis. The expectation value of `S_z` will oscillate as the spin vector, initially pointing along the z-axis, rotates in the x-z plane.\n\n6.  **Larmor Precession:** This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, known as the Larmor frequency, is given by `ω = γB`.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz>(t)`, will oscillate with this angular frequency. A detailed calculation shows that `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`. Consequently, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μz>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe oscillation frequency is the coefficient of `t` in the argument of the cosine function, which is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.

The eigenstates of `S_y` are:\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`\n    *   Inverting these, we get `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n    *   So, `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n    *   The time evolution of the `S_y` eigenstates is simple:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH_f t/ħ) |ψ(0)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_y^+ t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_y^- t/ħ)|-y>]`\n        where `E_y^+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_y^- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>]`\n    *   Now we calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`. We need to express `S_z` in the `S_y` basis, or convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the `S_z` basis. Let's do the latter.\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)) + exp(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>))]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (exp(iγBt/2) + exp(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iγBt/2) - exp(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n        Using Euler's formulas: `cos(x) = (e^{ix}+e^{-ix})/2` and `sin(x) = (e^{ix}-e^{-ix})/(2i)`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now, we compute the expectation value of `S_z`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `= (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n        `= (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+z> + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-z> )`\n        `= (ħ/2) * [cos^2(γBt/2) - sin^2(γBt/2)]`\n        Using the double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)`, this becomes:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Finding the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation. A general cosine oscillation is of the form `A*cos(ωt + φ)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    *   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   Oscillation (angular) frequency `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is an eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction, Sz, and is denoted as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with magnitude B, the interaction between the particle's magnetic moment (μ) and the new magnetic field creates a new Hamiltonian (H) for the system. The Hamiltonian is given by H = -**μ** · **B**. Since **μ** = γ**S** (where **S** is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio) and **B** is now B**ŷ** (a vector of magnitude B in the Y direction), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB * Sy, where Sy is the spin operator in the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle, |ψ(t)>, evolves over time according to the Schrödinger equation. Starting from the initial state |ψ(0)> = `|+z>`, the state at a later time t is given by |ψ(t)> = e<sup>-iHt/ħ</sup>|ψ(0)>.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value**: We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μz(t)>. This is equal to γ times the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <Sz(t)>. The expectation value is calculated as <Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>.\n\n5.  **Larmor Precession**: This physical situation describes Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, will start to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis). The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency**: The projection of the precessing spin vector onto the original Z-axis will oscillate. The angular frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula ω = γB. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <Sz(t)>, will be found to oscillate with a term proportional to cos(γBt). Therefore, the angular frequency of this oscillation is γB.\n\nBased on this, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe python script successfully calculated the time evolution of the spin-1/2 particle. The key result is the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which was found to be:\n\n`<mu_z>(t) = gamma*hbar*cos(B*gamma*t)/2`\n\nThis expression describes an oscillation. An oscillating function is generally written as `A*cos(omega*t + phi)`, where `omega` is the angular frequency. By comparing the calculated expression to this general form, we can see that the term multiplying time `t` inside the cosine function is `gamma*B`. Therefore, the oscillation frequency `omega` is `gamma*B`.\n\nThe `IndexError` at the end of the script was due to an attempt to programmatically parse the symbolic expression, which failed. However, the physical result was correctly calculated and printed just before the error, allowing for the frequency to be identified by inspection. The calculated frequency `gamma*B` corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nWhen a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is in a magnetic field **B**, its spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession, called the Larmor frequency, is given by ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the z-component of the spin operator, S<sub>z</sub>.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin of the particle begins to precess around the new field direction. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, changes to H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB S<sub>y</sub>.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>>, will then oscillate as the spin precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of any spin component perpendicular to the magnetic field will oscillate with the Larmor frequency. In this case, the z-component of the spin is perpendicular to the new magnetic field, which is in the Y direction.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is equal to the Larmor frequency, which is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer:** The problem describes a classic magnetic resonance scenario. A spin-1/2 particle, initially in a spin-up state along the Z-axis, is subjected to a magnetic field in the Y-direction. This will cause the spin to precess around the new field direction. The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is directly proportional to the expectation value of the spin operator's z-component, `<Sz>`.\n\nMy proposed solution path is to:\n1.  Define the initial state of the particle at t=0.\n2.  Define the Hamiltonian that governs the system for t>0.\n3.  Calculate the time evolution of the state vector.\n4.  Use the time-evolved state vector to compute the expectation value `<Sz(t)>`.\n5.  From the resulting expression for `<Sz(t)>`, determine the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\nThis is a standard quantum mechanics problem that can be solved analytically. The frequency should be the Larmor frequency, which is related to the gyromagnetic ratio (gamma) and the magnetic field strength (B). I will perform a search to confirm the exact formula and its derivation in this context.\n\n### Self-Debate\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nThe problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of a spin's magnetic moment. The particle starts in a spin-up state along the Z-axis, `|+Z>`, and is then subjected to a magnetic field `B` along the Y-axis. The new Hamiltonian is `H = -μ · B = - (γS_y)B = -γBS_y`.\n\nThe spin will precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis). The z-component of the spin, which is perpendicular to the new field, will oscillate. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nMy proposed action is to calculate this frequency by determining the time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z(t)>`.\n\n**Role: Skeptic**\nThe proposed path is sound, but the calculation must be precise. Key points to verify are:\n1.  The correct representation of the initial state `|+Z>` in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates (the eigenstates of `S_y`).\n2.  The correct energy eigenvalues for the new Hamiltonian.\n3.  The correct application of the time-evolution operator `exp(-iHt/ħ)`.\n4.  The correct calculation of the final expectation value `<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nA mistake in any of these steps, particularly with factors of 2 or `ħ`, could lead to an incorrect frequency. The classical formula for the Larmor frequency is `ω = γB`, but it's crucial to confirm this holds for the expectation value in this specific quantum system.\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nI will proceed with the calculation.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |+Z>`. In the `S_z` basis, this is the vector `(1, 0)`.\n\n2.  **New Basis:** The new Hamiltonian is proportional to `S_y`. The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+Y>` and `|-Y>`. We must express `|+Z>` in this basis.\n    *   `|+Y> = (1/√2) * (|+Z> + i|-Z>)`\n    *   `|-Y> = (1/√2) * (|+Z> - i|-Z>)`\n    *   Solving for `|+Z>`, we find: `|+Z> = (1/√2) * (|+Y> + |-Y>)`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The energy eigenvalues of `H = -γBS_y` are `E_± = -γB(±ħ/2) = ∓(γBħ/2)`.\n    The time-evolved state is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|+Y> + exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|-Y>]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+Y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-Y>]`\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** To find `<S_z(t)>`, we can substitute the `S_y` eigenstates back with `S_z` eigenstates:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [exp(iγBt/2)(|+Z> + i|-Z>) + exp(-iγBt/2)(|+Z> - i|-Z>)]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [(exp(iγBt/2) + exp(-iγBt/2))|+Z> + i(exp(iγBt/2) - exp(-iγBt/2))|-Z>]`\n    Using Euler's formulas, this simplifies to:\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+Z> - sin(γBt/2)|-Z>`\n\n    Now we calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+Z| - sin(γBt/2)<-Z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+Z> - sin(γBt/2)|-Z>)`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+Z| - sin(γBt/2)<-Z|) * ( (ħ/2)cos(γBt/2)|+Z> + (ħ/2)sin(γBt/2)|-Z> )`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of spin, `<S_z(t)>`, oscillates with an angular frequency of `ω = γB`. The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`, therefore also oscillates with this same frequency.\n\n**Role: Skeptic**\nThe calculation is detailed and appears correct. The result `ω = γB` matches the known Larmor frequency, which is confirmed by multiple physics sources to be the precession frequency for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field.
