Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**B. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\nLet's analyze each signal to piece together the structure.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent (which must be an electron-donating alkyl group).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (to identify the second substituent):**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests a `-CH₂-CH₃` (ethyl) fragment.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This suggests a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to the terminal methyl group (3H) and the methine proton (1H), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its chemical shift around 2.9 ppm is typical for a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This proton is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the adjacent methylene group (2H), leading to a complex multiplet.\n\n**C. Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n1.  We have a benzoic acid core.\n2.  It is para-substituted.\n3.  The other substituent is an alkyl group. Let's assemble it:\n    *   We have a `CH` group directly attached to the ring.\n    *   This `CH` is attached to a `-CH₃` group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n    *   This `CH` is also attached to a `-CH₂CH₃` group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet and 1.7 ppm multiplet).\n4.  Putting it all together, the alkyl group is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\nTherefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X)\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)\n\nThe combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce many oxygen-containing functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically for this reaction:\n*   It reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The aromatic ring and the alkyl substituent are stable under these conditions and will not be changed.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\nWe start with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 4 to a methyl group.\n\n*   Starting material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n*   The sec-butyl group at position 1 remains unchanged.\n\nThe final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 4: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect.

The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, suggesting it is ortho (adjacent) to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting it is ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n    *   Now let's determine the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons is likely the -CH₂ group adjacent to the -CH₃ group (making it a quartet) and also adjacent to another group.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton is the -CH group. It is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic and shifting it downfield), the -CH₃ group (splitting it into a quartet), and the -CH₂ group (splitting it into a triplet). The combination results in a complex multiplet.\n    *   Assembling the alkyl group: The fragments are an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a methyl group (-CH₃), both attached to a methine (-CH-) carbon. This methine carbon is attached to the benzene ring. The resulting alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is from the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is from the protons adjacent to an alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (2.9 ppm to 0.9 ppm):**\n        *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** Likely the proton attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group coupled to a single proton.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group coupled to a methylene group.\n    *   Assembling the alkyl fragment: The signals are consistent with a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] attached to the benzene ring. The proton at 2.9 ppm is the CH, coupled to the methyl doublet at 1.4 ppm and the methylene multiplet at 1.7 ppm. The methylene group at 1.7 ppm is, in turn, coupled to the methyl triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n\nCombining these findings, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product\n\nThe problem states that Compound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\nThe carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group on the aromatic ring remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nThis final product matches option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The initial step is to deduce the structure of compound X from the provided spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and a sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which are characteristic of the O-H and C=O stretching of a carboxylic acid, respectively. The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of an aromatic ring.\n\nThe ¹H NMR data supports this. The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton. The doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, with the downfield signal being adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The remaining signals (2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)) correspond to a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Thus, compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\nThe second step is to identify the product of the reaction with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI). This reagent combination is a powerful reducing agent that reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). Therefore, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. My proposed action is to search for confirmation of this specific reduction reaction.\n\nSkeptic: Your interpretation of the spectra to identify compound X as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid seems sound. However, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is very harsh. Are you certain that it selectively reduces the carboxylic acid without affecting the benzene ring or causing rearrangement of the sec-butyl group? The sec-butyl carbocation is relatively stable and could potentially rearrange to a more stable tert-butyl carbocation under strong acid and heat, although this is less likely when it's attached to a benzene ring. We need to verify the specific outcome of the reduction of aromatic carboxylic acids with red P/HI.\n\nDecision: The skeptic's point about the harshness of the reaction conditions is valid. I need to confirm that the reaction of an aromatic carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI specifically reduces the carboxylic acid to an alkane without side reactions on the aromatic ring or the alkyl substituent.\n\nProposer: The search results confirm that red phosphorus and HI are strong reducing agents capable of reducing carboxylic acids to alkanes. Specifically, the reduction of acetic acid to ethane is mentioned, supporting the conversion of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group. The search also indicates that aromatic acids can be reduced, with one source mentioning the reduction of benzoic acid to toluene. The role of red phosphorus is to regenerate HI from the iodine formed during the reaction, allowing catalytic amounts of HI to be used. The information gathered strongly supports the initial hypothesis.\n\nSkeptic: While the general reaction is confirmed, the search results don't explicitly address the stability of the *sec*-butyl group under these harsh conditions. Rearrangement of carbocations is a known phenomenon in strong acid. Although the reaction proceeds, we haven't definitively ruled out the possibility of the *sec*-butyl group rearranging to a more stable *tert*-butyl group, which would lead to 1-(tert-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Also, none of the examples show a substituted benzoic acid with an alkyl group that could potentially rearrange.\n\nDecision: The point about the potential rearrangement of the sec-butyl group is a valid concern that hasn't been fully addressed. However, given the provided multiple-choice options, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is a listed product, whereas the rearranged product, 1-(tert-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, is not. This strongly suggests that rearrangement is not expected to be the major pathway in this context. The primary and well-documented reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alkane. Therefore, I have sufficient confidence to proceed with the answer based on the initial analysis and the supporting search results.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**B. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\nLet's analyze each signal to piece together the structure.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent (which must be an electron-donating alkyl group).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (to identify the second substituent):**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests a `-CH₂-CH₃` (ethyl) fragment.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This suggests a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to the terminal methyl group (3H) and the methine proton (1H), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its chemical shift around 2.9 ppm is typical for a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This proton is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the adjacent methylene group (2H), leading to a complex multiplet.\n\n**C. Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n1.  We have a benzoic acid core.\n2.  It is para-substituted.\n3.  The other substituent is an alkyl group. Let's assemble it:\n    *   We have a `CH` group directly attached to the ring.\n    *   This `CH` is attached to a `-CH₃` group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n    *   This `CH` is also attached to a `-CH₂CH₃` group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet and 1.7 ppm multiplet).\n4.  Putting it all together, the alkyl group is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\nTherefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X)\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)\n\nThe combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent.

The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, suggesting it is ortho (adjacent) to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting it is ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n    *   Now let's determine the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons is likely the -CH₂ group adjacent to the -CH₃ group (making it a quartet) and also adjacent to another group.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton is the -CH group. It is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic and shifting it downfield), the -CH₃ group (splitting it into a quartet), and the -CH₂ group (splitting it into a triplet). The combination results in a complex multiplet.\n    *   Assembling the alkyl group: The fragments are an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a methyl group (-CH₃), both attached to a methine (-CH-) carbon. This methine carbon is attached to the benzene ring. The resulting alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n\n3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Therefore, the reaction converts 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern strongly suggests a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is from the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is from the protons adjacent to an alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (2.9 ppm to 0.9 ppm):**\n        *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** Likely the proton attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group coupled to a single proton.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group coupled to a methylene group.\n    *   Assembling the alkyl fragment: The signals are consistent with a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] attached to the benzene ring. The proton at 2.9 ppm is the CH, coupled to the methyl doublet at 1.4 ppm and the methylene multiplet at 1.7 ppm. The methylene group at 1.7 ppm is, in turn, coupled to the methyl triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n\nCombining these findings, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product\n\nThe problem states that Compound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\nThe carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group on the aromatic ring remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nThis final product matches option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The initial step is to deduce the structure of compound X from the provided spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and a sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which are characteristic of the O-H and C=O stretching of a carboxylic acid, respectively. The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of an aromatic ring.\n\nThe ¹H NMR data supports this. The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton. The doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, with the downfield signal being adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The remaining signals (2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)) correspond to a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Thus, compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\nThe second step is to identify the product of the reaction with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI). This reagent combination is a powerful reducing agent that reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). Therefore, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. My proposed action is to search for confirmation of this specific reduction reaction.\n\nSkeptic: Your interpretation of the spectra to identify compound X as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid seems sound. However, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is very harsh. Are you certain that it selectively reduces the carboxylic acid without affecting the benzene ring or causing rearrangement of the sec-butyl group? The sec-butyl carbocation is relatively stable and could potentially rearrange to a more stable tert-butyl carbocation under strong acid and heat, although this is less likely when it's attached to a benzene ring. We need to verify the specific outcome of the reduction of aromatic carboxylic acids with red P/HI.\n\nDecision: The skeptic's point about the harshness of the reaction conditions is valid. I need to confirm that the reaction of an aromatic carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI specifically reduces the carboxylic acid to an alkane without side reactions on the aromatic ring or the alkyl substituent.\n\nProposer: The search results confirm that red phosphorus and HI are strong reducing agents capable of reducing carboxylic acids to alkanes. Specifically, the reduction of acetic acid to ethane is mentioned, supporting the conversion of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group. The search also indicates that aromatic acids can be reduced, with one source mentioning the reduction of benzoic acid to toluene. The role of red phosphorus is to regenerate HI from the iodine formed during the reaction, allowing catalytic amounts of HI to be used. The information gathered strongly supports the initial hypothesis.\n\nSkeptic: While the general reaction is confirmed, the search results don't explicitly address the stability of the *sec*-butyl group under these harsh conditions. Rearrangement of carbocations is a known phenomenon in strong acid. Although the reaction proceeds, we haven't definitively ruled out the possibility of the *sec*-butyl group rearranging to a more stable *tert*-butyl group, which would lead to 1-(tert-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Also, none of the examples show a substituted benzoic acid with an alkyl group that could potentially rearrange.\n\nDecision: The point about the potential rearrangement of the sec-butyl group is a valid concern that hasn't been fully addressed. However, given the provided multiple-choice options, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is a listed product, whereas the rearranged product, 1-(tert-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, is not. This strongly suggests that rearrangement is not expected to be the major pathway in this context. The primary and well-documented reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alkane. Therefore, I have sufficient confidence to proceed with the answer based on the initial analysis and the supporting search results.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
