This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group creates two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but different configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, three stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule).\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **three** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair will elute together as one peak, while the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the pair) will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (a strong reducing agent). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group creates two different products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one center having the same configuration (5S) and the other having a different configuration (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, we must consider the stereochemical relationships.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have different properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally different and will not have the same retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I**: Determine the products of the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH.

This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group creates two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. One center is the same (5S), while the other is different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The pair of enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will be separated, giving a **second peak**. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The mixture contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    1.

This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at the new C3 stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction produces two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but different configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers** and are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total combined mixture contains 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n*   **Rule:** It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Rule:** It can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all five of these compounds into separate peaks.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the formation of a new stereocenter results in two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral as it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the product molecule, we must consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and thus form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally different and will not have the same retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers. Each of the five compounds will produce a separate peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the formation of a new stereocenter results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, three stereoisomers are possible:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (This is a meso compound, and the (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule).\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**.

It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and have different physical properties. They will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**. Thus, the products from Reaction II yield **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not have the same retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).

This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, three distinct stereoisomers are formed:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, known as **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.

The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total product mixture contains five unique stereoisomers: the two diastereomers from Reaction I, and the pair of enantiomers and the meso compound from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column can differentiate between all non-identical stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all five of these compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting molecule is already chiral, the formation of a new stereocenter results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.

It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.

It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at the new C3 stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction produces two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but different configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers** and are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total combined mixture contains 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n*   **Rule:** It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Rule:** It can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all five of these compounds into separate peaks.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the formation of a new stereocenter results in two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral as it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the product molecule, we must consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images and thus form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally different and will not have the same retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers. Each of the five compounds will produce a separate peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction produces a mixture of two compounds:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but different configurations at the other (C3). By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers** and are formed as a racemic (1:1) mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains 5 total stereoisomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak.\n        *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally distinct and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option stating \"5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\".\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas and functional groups) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II). A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them.\n    *   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.
