This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Formula**: The principle is expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations involving the lifetime (τ) of a state, this is often approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width.\n    *   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: We use the formula to find the inherent energy \"smear\" for each level.\n    *   **State 1**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the energy distributions will overlap, making them indistinguishable. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁), and this width is the primary limiting factor. Therefore, the condition for resolution is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**: We must check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is much greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Principle and Formula**: The energy-time uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    \n    ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n    \n    For calculation purposes, we can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty, also known as the natural energy width, as:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    \n    We will use the value of ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: We need to find the inherent energy \"smear\" for each level due to its finite lifetime.\n    *   **State 1**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂). This larger width is the primary limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n    \n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options**: We must check which of the provided options satisfies this condition. The options are:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    \n    Let's compare each option to the required minimum difference of ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV (or 0.66 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.**\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Only an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Inverse Relationship**: The core of the problem is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy uncertainty. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more uncertain energy.\n*   **Limiting Factor**: The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is therefore the limiting factor in resolving the two levels.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\"**: This phrase implies the separation must be significantly greater than the energy widths, not just equal to or slightly larger. The fact that 10⁻⁴ eV is several orders of magnitude larger than the required minimum makes it the unambiguous choice.\n*   **Option Consistency**: It is crucial to map the correct calculated value (10⁻⁴ eV) to the corresponding letter in the original question's list, which is C.

Apply the Resolution Condition and Evaluate Options**\nThe larger of the two energy widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

The relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).

It states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (τ) are inversely related. The formula is often approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This uncertainty, ΔE, is also known as the natural linewidth or energy width of the state.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: We need to calculate the inherent energy spread for both quantum states.\n    *   **State 1**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Establish the Condition for Resolution**: For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the separation between their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the energy distributions of the states will overlap, making them indistinguishable. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂) and therefore presents the main challenge for resolution. The energy difference must be greater than this larger width.\n    *   Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    *   Therefore: |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**: We must check which of the provided options satisfies this condition.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This value is significantly greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷).

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles review of the physics involved, here is the step-by-step decision process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle**: The core of the problem lies in the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which a quantum state's energy (E) and its lifetime (τ) can be simultaneously known. The relationship is expressed as ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also called the natural linewidth or energy width) and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). For practical calculations, the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ is used.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy level; it is \"smeared\" over a range ΔE. A shorter lifetime results in a larger energy width.\n    *   **State 1**: Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2**: Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n3.  **Establish the Condition for Resolution**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂). This broader energy level is the primary limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than this larger width.\n    *   **Condition for resolution**: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Against the Condition**: We must check which of the given options satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁸ = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷). This is not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is not resolvable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is significantly larger than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). **This is clearly resolvable.**\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is not resolvable.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Inverse Relationship**: The central concept is the inverse relationship between a state's lifetime and its energy uncertainty. A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more \"fuzzy\" energy level.\n*   **The Limiting Factor**: Resolution is always limited by the broader of the two energy levels, which corresponds to the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s).\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\"**: This term implies the energy separation should be significantly larger than the energy width, not just comparable or slightly larger. The value 10⁻⁴ eV is over 1,500 times larger than the required minimum, satisfying this condition unambiguously.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: There is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on the physics, the calculation, and the final numerical result (10⁻⁴ eV). The variation in the final lettered answers (A, B, C, D) is due to the options being presented to the agents in different random orders. The correct procedure is to ignore the letters from the candidate answers and map the unanimously agreed-upon numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV) to the option list provided in the original question.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only energy difference that is sufficiently large to allow the two states to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The energy separation must be greater than this value.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\"**: This implies the separation should not be marginal but significant. An energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is about 150 times larger than the broader energy width, ensuring a very clear separation.\n*   **Option Scrambling**: Many of the provided candidate answers correctly calculated the value 10⁻⁴ eV but selected the wrong letter (B, C, or D). This is a common error of mis-mapping the calculated result to the original list of options. The value 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option A in the question prompt.\n\nBased on the analysis, only an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently large to clearly resolve the two quantum states.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identify the Governing Principle**\n\nThe problem requires determining the condition to distinguish two energy levels based on their lifetimes. This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (τ) are inversely related:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). For calculations, we can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty, also known as the natural linewidth, as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n### **2. Define the Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths (ΔE₁ and ΔE₂). The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary factor limiting the resolution. Therefore, as a minimum condition, the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\n\nCondition: |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)\n\n### **3. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow, we calculate the corresponding energy widths:\n\n*   **Energy width of State 1 (ΔE₁):**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    **ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **Energy width of State 2 (ΔE₂):**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    **ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### **4. Apply the Resolution Condition**\n\nThe larger of the two energy widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this value:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe compare the given options to this requirement:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is significantly larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Resolvable)\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
