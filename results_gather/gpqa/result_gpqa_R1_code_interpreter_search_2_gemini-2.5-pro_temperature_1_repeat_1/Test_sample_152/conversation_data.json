    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is electron-deficient due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group, making it electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic Attack):** The malonate enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   **Step 2 (Intermediate Formation):** This attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond and generates another enolate intermediate: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -⁻CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) during the workup to give the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The final product structure is p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   To name this compound according to the options provided, we need to identify the main propane chain that carries the three ester groups. The chain consists of the α-carbon of the acrylate, the β-carbon of the acrylate, and the carbon from the malonate.\n    *   Let's number this chain C1-C2-C3 for IUPAC naming purposes, prioritizing the functional groups. The carbon from the malonate bears two ester groups and is designated C1. The β-carbon from the acrylate is C2, and the α-carbon and its attached ester form the rest of the chain at the C3 position.\n        *   **C1:** -CH(COOCH₃)₂\n        *   **C2:** -CH(p-tolyl)-\n        *   **C3:** -CH₂(COOCH₃)\n    *   Combining these parts gives the structure: MeOOC-CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 position of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Michael Addition):** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate and a stabilized carbanion on the nitrile portion.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the cyclohexanone ring and releasing piperidine as a byproduct.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The reaction forms a bond between C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent added to the cyclohexanone ring is -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with this substituent at the 2-position (alpha to the carbonyl).\n    *   To name this product, we can consider butanenitrile as the parent chain. The chain is CH₃-CH-CH₂-CN. The substituent on this chain is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group located at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain (numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1).\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative product, 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, is the enol form, which is generally less stable than the keto form produced after acidic hydrolysis.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type (Retrosynthesis):** We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring substituted at the C2 position with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃.\n\n2.  **Determine Reactant C:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the C-C bond is formed between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The fragment in the product that comes from the acceptor (MVK) is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This corresponds to the addition to the double bond of MVK followed by protonation.\n    *   This fragment is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2 (located between two carbonyl groups) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Thus, the starting material **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect A, Incorrect B, Incorrect C\n*   B) Correct A, Correct B, Correct C\n*   C) Correct A, Correct B, Incorrect C\n*   D) Incorrect A, Incorrect B, Correct C\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
