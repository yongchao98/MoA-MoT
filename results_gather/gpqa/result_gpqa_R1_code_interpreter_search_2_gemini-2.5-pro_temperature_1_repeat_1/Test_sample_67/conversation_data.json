    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin 1/2. Its state can be described by a 2-component vector (spinor).\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator. The components of the spin operator are `Sx`, `Sy`, and `Sz`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * ẑ` (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_i = -μ ⋅ B_vec = -γS ⋅ (B * ẑ) = -γB * Sz`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `H_i` are the eigenstates of `Sz`. These are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lower energy state is `|+z⟩`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. In the standard basis where `|+z⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|-z⟩ = [0, 1]`, we have `|ψ(0)⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Define the Final Hamiltonian and Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B'_vec = B * ŷ` (in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution for `t > 0`, is `H = -μ ⋅ B'_vec = -γS ⋅ (B * ŷ) = -γB * Sy`.\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H = -γB * Sy`, we get `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB * Sy)t/ħ) = exp(iγBtSy/ħ)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The spin operator `Sy` is represented by the matrix `Sy = (ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   Substituting `Sy` into the evolution operator:\n        `U(t) = exp(iγBt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`.\n    *   We can use the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix: `exp(iθn⋅σ) = cos(θ)I + isin(θ)(n⋅σ)`, where `n` is a unit vector and `I` is the identity matrix.\n    *   In our case, `θ = γBt/2` and the operator is `σ_y`.\n    *   So, `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y`.\n    *   In matrix form:\n        `U(t) = cos(γBt/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(γBt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n        This operator represents a rotation around the Y-axis by an angle `γBt`.\n    *   Now, we find the state at time `t` by applying `U(t)` to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = [[1], [0]]`:\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n        `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    *   The quantity we want to find is the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩`.\n    *   `⟨μ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   We know `μ_z = γSz`, and `Sz = (ħ/2)σ_z`, where `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   First, let's find the expectation value of `Sz`, which is `⟨Sz⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   The bra vector `⟨ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)⟩`: `⟨ψ(t)| = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    *   Let's calculate `Sz|ψ(t)⟩`:\n        `Sz|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]] = (ħ/2) [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product `⟨ψ(t)|(Sz|ψ(t)⟩)`:\n        `⟨Sz⟩ = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n        `⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n    *   Finally, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨Sz⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Identify the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The expression for `⟨μ_z⟩(t)` is a cosine function of time. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`.\n    *   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation, `ω`.\n    *   `ω = γB`.\n    *   This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. It describes the precession of the spin's expectation value around the new magnetic field.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
