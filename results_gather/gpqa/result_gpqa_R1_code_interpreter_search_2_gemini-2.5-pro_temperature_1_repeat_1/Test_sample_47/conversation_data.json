    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1**\n\nThis is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone (a cyclic ketone with 6 carbons).\n*   **Reaction:** Bromination at the α-position.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heat) → Product 2**\n\nWhen an α-halo ketone is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a ring contraction reaction known as the **Favorskii rearrangement** occurs. While an elimination reaction is also possible, the Favorskii rearrangement is a common pathway under these conditions and leads to a logical final product that matches the options provided.\n\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the strained carbonyl carbon of the intermediate.\n    4.  The ring opens to form the more stable carbanion, which results in a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation (during workup, which is implied) yields a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\n\nThis is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reaction:** Conversion of -COOH to -COCl.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of an acyl chloride to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n \n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct (non-equivalent) hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon to which it is attached. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's label the hydrogens:\n*   **Hₐ:** The aldehyde proton.\n*   **Hₑ:** The proton on C1.\n*   **Hᵦ, Hᵦ'**: Protons on C2 and C5 (β-positions).\n*   **Hᵧ, Hᵧ'**: Protons on C3 and C4 (γ-positions).\n\n \n\nDue to the plane of symmetry:\n*   C2 is equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the sets of distinct hydrogens:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (Hₐ):** It is unique. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (Hₑ):** It is attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group. It is also unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*. The plane of symmetry makes the *cis* proton on C2 equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5. Similarly, the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons. (2 signals)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The same logic applies. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two *cis*-like protons on C3 and C4 equivalent, and the two *trans*-like protons equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 signals)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen sets = 1 (from Hₐ) + 1 (from Hₑ) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
