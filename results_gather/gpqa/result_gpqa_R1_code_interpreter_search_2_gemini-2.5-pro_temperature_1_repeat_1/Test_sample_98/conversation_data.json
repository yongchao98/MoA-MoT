    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded environment, specifically the very broad peak seen in carboxylic acids.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This means there are no protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons of a C=C double bond. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one neighboring proton (n=1, based on the n+1 rule).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3).\n    *   Therefore, the proton giving this signal must be a methine (-CH-) proton adjacent to a -CH- group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This pattern also arises from coupling to three different sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to another, non-equivalent set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, the proton giving this signal must be a methine (-CH-) proton adjacent to a -CH- group and two different -CH₂- groups.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton environment matching the `dtq` pattern and another matching the `dtt` pattern. The methine (-CH-) protons are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `CH₃(f)-CH(e)-CH(d)-CH₂(c)-COOH`\n           `|      |`\n          `CH₃(g) CH₃(h)`\n    *   Proton H(d) is coupled to H(c) (2H, triplet) and H(e) (1H, doublet). Its signal would be a doublet of triplets (**dt**).\n    *   Proton H(e) is coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet) and H(f) (3H, quartet). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets (**dq**).\n    *   This structure does not produce `dtq` or `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `CH₃CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, which matches Signal 2.\n    *   However, the proton at C2 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet), giving a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. There is no proton that would give a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `CH₃CH₂-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-COOH`\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, which matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, the proton at C2 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet), giving a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. There is no proton that would give a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\n    First, let's determine the correct IUPAC name from the condensed formula. The longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is a 6-carbon chain (hexanoic acid), with a methyl group at C4 and an ethyl group at C3.\n    Structure:\n                   `CH₃(f)`\n                   `|`\n    `CH₃(g)-CH₂(e)-CH(d)-CH(c)-CH₂(b)-COOH`\n                            `|`\n                           `CH₂(h)-CH₃(i)`\n    *   **Proton H(c) at C3:** This methine proton is coupled to three adjacent proton groups:\n        1.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        2.  The CH proton at C4 (H(d), 1H) -> **doublet**\n        3.  The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent (H(h), 2H) -> **triplet**\n        The resulting multiplicity is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **Proton H(d) at C4:** This methine proton is also coupled to three adjacent proton groups:\n        1.  The CH proton at C3 (H(c), 1H) -> **doublet**\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C5 (H(e), 2H) -> **triplet**\n        3.  The CH₃ group of the methyl substituent (H(f), 3H) -> **quartet**\n        The resulting multiplicity is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure B is the only compound that has one proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal and another that would produce a `dtq` signal. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
