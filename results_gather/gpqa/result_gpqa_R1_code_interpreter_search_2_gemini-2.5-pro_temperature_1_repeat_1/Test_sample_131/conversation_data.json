    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both unknown compounds are C10H14. This gives an index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of 4, suggesting an aromatic ring (IHD=4).\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. The fact that all signals are singlets indicates that the protons on the alkyl groups (methyls in this case, as we'll see) are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each option to predict its individual 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments relative to the methyl groups and are therefore not equivalent. Neither has an adjacent proton. This results in **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. Although they are adjacent, their chemical equivalence results in a single signal, which appears as a **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent by symmetry (6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet and the -CH3 protons will be a triplet. Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **this compound can be ruled out**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in each option, remembering it's a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three aromatic singlets (unless there is accidental overlap), which contradicts the observation of only two.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this would result in **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integration ratio would be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio would be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three aromatic singlets, which contradicts the observation of only two.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
