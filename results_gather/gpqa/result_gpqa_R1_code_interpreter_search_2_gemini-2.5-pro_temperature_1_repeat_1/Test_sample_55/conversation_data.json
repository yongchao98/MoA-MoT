    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a cascade of two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:** For an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   There is no selection rule for the principal quantum number $n$, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, which means $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate states:**\n    *   **First transition:** From $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Initial state has $l=0, m=0$.\n        *   Applying the selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   The principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3. The options provided in the question all suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. Let's verify this is a valid step in the cascade.\n    *   **Second transition:** From $|n',l',m'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Initial state (intermediate) has $n'=2, l'=1$.\n        *   Final state has $n_{final}=1, l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0$.\n        *   Applying the selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are indeed $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This gives us three possible transition routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability for each route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade occurring is determined by the branching ratios at each step.\n    *   The total process is the decay of the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state. The only allowed E1 decay channels from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ are to states with $l=1$. The lowest energy states with $l=1$ are the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states. (A transition to $|1,1,m'\\rangle$ is impossible because for $n=1$, only $l=0$ is allowed). So, the atom in state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ will decay to one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    *   The probability of taking a specific path, e.g., through $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is given by the branching ratio of the first step:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle)}{A_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle)}$\n        where $A$ is the transition rate (Einstein A coefficient).\n    *   The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states:\n        $A_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) + A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) + A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the relative transition rates:**\n    The transition rate $A_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    $A_{nlm \\to n'l'm'} \\propto |\\langle n'l'm' | x | nlm \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle n'l'm' | y | nlm \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle n'l'm' | z | nlm \\rangle|^2$.\n    The calculation of these matrix elements involves a radial integral and an angular integral. For transitions from a common initial state $|n,l\\rangle$ to different $m'$ states of a $|n',l'\\rangle$ manifold, the radial integral is the same. The relative rates are determined by the angular part.\n    For the first transition from $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$).\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the transition rates to the three substates $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are equal.\n    *   Let's briefly show this. The rate is proportional to $\\sum_{q} |\\langle l'm' | T^1_q | lm \\rangle|^2$, where $T^1_q$ are the tensor components of the dipole operator. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the angular part depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle$. For our first transition, this is $\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle$, which has a value of 1 for all $m' = -1,0,1$.\n    *   Therefore, $A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = A(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n    *   Let this rate be $A_0$. The total rate is $A_{total} = A_0 + A_0 + A_0 = 3A_0$.\n\n6.  **Determine the branching ratio and final probability:**\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to any specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (as this is the only lower-energy state allowed by the E1 selection rules). Thus, the probability of the second step in the cascade is 1.\n    *   The overall probability for a given cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n        $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   Similarly, the probability for the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are also both $1/3$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The problem asks to identify the correct pair of (transition route, probability).\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
