    "Annihilation is a process in which a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide and their mass is converted into energy, which then materializes into other particles. In this problem, we analyze the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\n\n*   **Particles:** We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   **Mass:** Protons and antiprotons have the same rest mass. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.27$ MeV.\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can also assume the proton is at rest in the lab frame. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is dominated by the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    $E_{initial} = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} \\approx (m_p c^2) + (m_{\\bar{p}} c^2) = 2 m_p c^2$\n*   **Momentum:** Since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is slowly moving, the total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) is approximately zero.\n\n### 2. Final State Analysis\n\n*   **Particles:** The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   **Mass:** We are given that the rest mass energy of each particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. We assume $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair and have the same mass.\n*   **Energy:** The total initial energy is converted into the total final energy of the four A particles. This final energy includes both their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to the conservation of momentum (the initial momentum is zero), the final particles must be produced in a way that their total momentum is also zero. The most symmetric and simplest assumption is that the available energy is distributed equally among the four identical-mass product particles. Thus, all four particles will have the same speed $v$ and the same energy $E_A$.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 3. Applying Conservation of Energy\n\nThe principle of conservation of energy states that the total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n1.  Substitute the known values into the energy conservation equation:\n    $2 \\times (938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n\n2.  Simplify the equation:\n    $1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n3.  Solve for $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n4.  Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity $v$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n5.  Substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity $v \\approx 0.77c$ matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
