    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line:** This is a specific spectral line of hydrogen with a rest-frame wavelength (the wavelength at which it is emitted) of λ_em = 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Redshift (z):** Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects like quasars gets stretched to longer wavelengths. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_em) and the redshift (z) by the formula: λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + z).\n    *   **Ground-based Optical Telescopes:** These telescopes operate from the Earth's surface. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to certain wavelengths of light, particularly UV radiation below about 3200-3500 Å due to absorption by the ozone layer. Therefore, for a spectral line to be detected by a ground-based telescope, its observed wavelength (λ_obs) must be longer than this atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the *lower limit* on the redshift (z) that would make the Lyα line from a quasar observable with a ground-based optical telescope. This means we need to find the smallest 'z' that shifts the 1216 Å line to a wavelength that can just pass through the atmosphere.\n\n3.  **Establish the Constraint (Atmospheric Cutoff):**\n    The critical value is the minimum wavelength that can be observed from the ground. This atmospheric cutoff is approximately 3500 Å. A signal with a wavelength shorter than this will be absorbed by the atmosphere and will not reach the telescope. So, we must have:\n    λ_obs ≥ 3500 Å\n\n4.  **Set up the Equation:**\n    We use the redshift formula and the constraint to solve for z:\n    *   λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + z)\n    *   We need λ_obs ≥ 3500 Å\n    *   Substituting the known values: 1216 Å * (1 + z) ≥ 3500 Å\n\n5.  **Solve for the Redshift (z):**\n    We can solve this inequality for 'z'. To find the lower limit, we set the two sides as equal.\n\n    ```python\n    # Define the rest-frame Lyman-alpha wavelength in Angstroms.\n    lambda_em = 1216\n    \n    # Define the approximate atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based optical telescopes in Angstroms.\n    # A common and practical value for the start of the observable window is around 3500 Angstroms.\n    lambda_obs_min = 3500\n    \n    # The redshift formula is z = (lambda_obs / lambda_em) - 1.\n    # We calculate the minimum redshift required to shift the Lyman-alpha line to the observable window.\n    z_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_em) - 1\n    \n    print(f\"The calculated lower limit on the redshift is: {z_min:.2f}\")\n    ```\n    \n    The calculated value is approximately 1.88.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated minimum redshift is z ≈ 1.88. We compare this value with the given multiple-choice options:\n    A) 2.4\n    B) 1.2\n    C) 1.9\n    D) 3\n\n    The value z ≈ 1.88 is closest to 1.9. Therefore, a redshift of at least z=1.9 is required to shift the 1216 Å Lyα line to an observable wavelength (~3526 Å), making it detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n<<<C>>>"
