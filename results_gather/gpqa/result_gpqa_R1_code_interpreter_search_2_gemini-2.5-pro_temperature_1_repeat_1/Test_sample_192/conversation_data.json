    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Given:** The number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`.\n    *   **Question:** How does the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) vary with `r`?\n    *   **Key Relationship:** I need to connect parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts and Relationships:**\n    *   **Parallax and Distance:** Stellar parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `plx = 1/r`, where `plx` is in arcseconds and `r` is in parsecs. For proportionality, we can write `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n    *   **\"Number of stars varies with...\"**: This phrase, \"the number of stars varies with parallax as...\", typically refers to the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`. This is a number density function. Let's denote the number of stars as `N`. The given information can be written mathematically as:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    *   **\"Number of stars per unit range of distance\"**: This is asking for the number density with respect to distance, `r`. Mathematically, this is:\n        `dN/dr`\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   The goal is to find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n    *   I have a relationship for `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   I need to transform the variable from `plx` to `r`.\n    *   The chain rule from calculus is the perfect tool for this: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan (Step-by-Step Calculation):**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Write down the knowns.**\n        *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` (Given)\n        *   `plx = 1/r` (Definition of parallax)\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n        *   `plx = r⁻¹`\n        *   `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Apply the chain rule.**\n        *   `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n        *   When dealing with number densities, which must be positive, we use the absolute value of the transformation derivative (the Jacobian). So, `dN/dr ∝ |(dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)|`.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * |-1/r²|`\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Substitute `plx` with its `r` equivalent to get the final relationship in terms of `r`.**\n        *   We know `plx = 1/r`. So, `1/plx = r`.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ ( (1/plx)^5 ) * (1/r²)`\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ ( r^5 ) * (1/r²)`\n\n    *   **Step 5: Simplify the expression.**\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n5.  **Final Check and Conclusion:**\n    *   The result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance (`r³`).\n    *   Let's check this against the provided options.\n        A) ~ r^5\n        B) ~ r^4\n        C) ~ r^3\n        D) ~ r^2\n    *   The calculated result `~ r³` matches option C.\n\nThis step-by-step process, starting from defining the terms, using the correct mathematical tool (chain rule), and performing the substitution and simplification, leads directly to the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
