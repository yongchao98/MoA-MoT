    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n### 1. Identify Given Information\n*   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n*   Lattice parameter, a = 10 Angstrom (This is the length of the primitive lattice vectors, `a=b=c`).\n*   Interaxial angle, `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n*   Miller indices of the plane, (hkl) = (111).\n\n### 2. Select the Correct Formula\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is given by:\n`1/d_hkl^2 = [(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))] / [a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))]`\n\nThis formula can be simplified. The denominator is a cubic expression in `cos(α)` which can be factored as `a^2 * (1 - cos(α))^2 * (1 + 2cos(α))`. The numerator can also be simplified. An equivalent and more direct form derived from the reciprocal lattice metric tensor is:\n`1/d_hkl^2 = [(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)(1 + cos(α)) - 2(hk + kl + lh)cos(α)] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\n### 3. Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane\nWe are interested in the (111) plane, so `h=1`, `k=1`, and `l=1`.\nLet's substitute these values into the simplified formula:\n*   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nNow, substitute these sums into the formula:\n`1/d_111^2 = [3(1 + cos(α)) - 2(3)cos(α)] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n`1/d_111^2 = [3 + 3cos(α) - 6cos(α)] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n`1/d_111^2 = [3 - 3cos(α)] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n`1/d_111^2 = 3(1 - cos(α)) / [a^2(1 - cos(α))(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\nThe `(1 - cos(α))` term cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n`1/d_111^2 = 3 / [a^2(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\nNow, we can solve for `d_111`:\n`d_111^2 = a^2(1 + 2cos(α)) / 3`\n`d_111 = a * sqrt[(1 + 2cos(α)) / 3]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Value\nNow we plug in the given values: `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°`.\n*   `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2 ≈ 0.866`\n\nWe can use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_degrees = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians for the math functions\nalpha_radians = math.radians(alpha_degrees)\n\n# Calculate cos(alpha)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_radians)\n\n# Use the simplified formula for d_111\n# d_111 = a * sqrt((1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3)\nd_111 = a * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n9.54297446113524\n```\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated value `d_111 ≈ 9.54` Angstrom matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a crystallography problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameters:** `a = b = c = 10` Angstrom\n*   **Interaxial Angles:** `α = β = γ = 30°`\n*   **Plane:** (111)\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the interplanar distance `d_111`.\n\n**2. Recall Relevant Physics/Chemistry Principles:**\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral (or trigonal) crystal system is:\n`1/d_hkl^2 = [(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)sin^2(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2(α) - cos(α))] / [a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))]`\n\nThis formula looks complicated. Let's see if there's a simpler version or if we can simplify it for the specific case of the (111) plane.\n\n**3. Simplification for the (111) plane:**\nFor the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, and `l = 1`.\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n*   `h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nNow, substitute these sums into the numerator of the formula:\nNumerator = `3 * sin^2(α) + 2 * 3 * (cos^2(α) - cos(α))`\n= `3sin^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\nUsing the identity `sin^2(α) = 1 - cos^2(α)`:\n= `3(1 - cos^2(α)) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n= `3 - 3cos^2(α) + 6cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n= `3 + 3cos^2(α) - 6cos(α)`\n= `3(1 - 2cos(α) + cos^2(α))`\n= `3(1 - cos(α))^2`\n\nNow let's look at the denominator:\nDenominator = `a^2(1 - 3cos^2(α) + 2cos^3(α))`\nThis is a cubic polynomial in `cos(α)`. Let `x = cos(α)`. The polynomial is `2x^3 - 3x^2 + 1`.\nWe can test for roots. If `x=1`, `2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 1 = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0`. So, `(x-1)` is a factor.\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division for `(2x^3 - 3x^2 + 0x + 1) / (x - 1)`:\n```\n1 | 2  -3   0   1\n  |    2  -1  -1\n  ----------------\n    2  -1  -1   0\n```\nSo, the quotient is `2x^2 - x - 1`. We can factor this further: `2x^2 - 2x + x - 1 = 2x(x-1) + 1(x-1) = (2x+1)(x-1)`.\nTherefore, `2x^3 - 3x^2 + 1 = (x-1)(x-1)(2x+1) = (x-1)^2(2x+1)`.\nSubstituting back `x = cos(α)`:\nDenominator = `a^2(cos(α) - 1)^2(2cos(α) + 1) = a^2(1 - cos(α))^2(1 + 2cos(α))`\n\nNow, let's put the simplified numerator and denominator back into the `1/d^2` formula:\n`1/d_111^2 = [3(1 - cos(α))^2] / [a^2(1 - cos(α))^2(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\nThe `(1 - cos(α))^2` term cancels out.\n`1/d_111^2 = 3 / [a^2(1 + 2cos(α))]`\n\nThis is a much simpler formula. Let's rearrange to solve for `d_111`:\n`d_111^2 = [a^2(1 + 2cos(α))] / 3`\n`d_111 = a * sqrt[(1 + 2cos(α)) / 3]`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation:**\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = 30°`\n*   `cos(30°) = sqrt(3) / 2 ≈ 0.866025`\n\nLet's plug these values into the simplified formula. It's best to use a calculator or a script to avoid rounding errors.\n\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[(1 + 2 * cos(30°)) / 3]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[(1 + 2 * (sqrt(3)/2)) / 3]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[(1 + sqrt(3)) / 3]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[(1 + 1.73205) / 3]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[2.73205 / 3]`\n`d_111 = 10 * sqrt[0.91068]`\n`d_111 = 10 * 0.954297`\n`d_111 ≈ 9.54297`\n\nThis matches the result from the Python code execution.\n\n**5. Compare with the Options:**\n*   A) 10.05 Angstrom\n*   B) 9.08 Angstrom\n*   C) 9.54 Angstrom\n*   D) 8.95 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value is `~9.54` Angstrom. This matches option C.\n\nThe reasoning is complete, and the calculation confirms the result. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
