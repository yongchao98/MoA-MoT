    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the components:** The solution is a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H+ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n        Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely according to the equation: Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH-. Therefore, it provides 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 moles of OH- ions.\n\n3.  **Determine the total moles of acidic and basic species:**\n    *   Total moles of acid (H+ donors) = moles of H+ from HCl + moles of CH3COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol.\n    *   Total moles of base (OH- donors) = 0.180 mol.\n\n4.  **Perform the neutralization reaction:** The strong base (OH-) will neutralize all the acidic species present. Since the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol), the final solution will be basic.\n\n5.  **Calculate the excess moles of base:**\n    *   Excess moles of OH- = Total moles of OH- - Total moles of acid\n    *   Excess moles of OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n6.  **Calculate the total volume of the final solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of CH3COOH + Volume of HCl + Volume of Ba(OH)2\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n7.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions:**\n    *   [OH-] = Excess moles of OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\n8.  **Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe calculation can be confirmed using the following Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles calculations\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300\n\n# Total moles of acid and base\ntotal_moles_acid = moles_hcl + moles_ch3cooh\ntotal_moles_oh = 2 * moles_baoh2\n\n# Excess moles of OH-\nexcess_moles_oh = total_moles_oh - total_moles_acid\n\n# Total volume\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n\n# Final concentration of OH-\nfinal_conc_oh = excess_moles_oh / total_volume\n\n# pOH and pH calculation\npOH = -math.log10(final_conc_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH = {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves the reaction between a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The first step is to calculate the number of moles of H+ ions and OH- ions.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of each substance.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    Molarity = 0.1 M\n    Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HCl (strong acid):**\n    Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    Molarity = 0.2 M\n    Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    Molarity = 0.3 M\n    Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it dissociates completely to give two OH⁻ ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total moles of acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Total moles of acid:** The strong base will react with all available acidic protons, both from the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    Total moles of acid = Moles of H⁺ from HCl + Moles of CH3COOH\n    Total moles of acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of base:**\n    Total moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n\n**Step 3: Perform the neutralization reaction.**\n\nCompare the total moles of acid and base.\nMoles of OH⁻ (0.180 mol) > Total moles of acid (0.130 mol)\nThis means the base is in excess, and all the acid will be consumed.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the moles of excess base.**\n\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Initial moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid\n    Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻ ions.**\n\n*   First, calculate the total volume of the solution.\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻.\n    [OH⁻] = Excess moles of OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the pOH and pH.**\n\n*   **pOH:**\n    pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **pH:**\n    At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
