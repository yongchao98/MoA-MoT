    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the products based on the experimental data.**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the components of the mixture by what happens in each tube.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. Its weight increased by 3.60 g. This means the gas mixture contained 3.60 g of water (H₂O).\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = (2 * 1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ (which would form a precipitate CaCO₃ or CaSO₃). The weight did not change, which means no such acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxidizing agents, especially those containing oxygen. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due solely to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This means the gas mixture contained an oxidizing gas that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas passed through all tubes without reacting. It is inert. Given that we are likely decomposing nitrogen-containing salts (a common theme in such problems), this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Deduce the composition of the initial gas mixture.**\n    *   The inert gas C is N₂. So, 0.10 mol of N₂ exits the setup. Where did it come from?\n    *   The oxidizing gas that reacted with copper supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. A common oxidizing gas produced from salt decomposition is nitrous oxide (N₂O). Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   The reaction in tube №3 would be: `N₂O + Cu -> CuO + N₂`.\n    *   According to this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O produces 1 mole of CuO (containing 1 mole of O atoms) and 1 mole of N₂.\n    *   Since 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have entered the tube.\n    *   This reaction would have produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   The total N₂ exiting the tube (Gas C) is 0.10 mol. This is composed of N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction and any N₂ that was present in the original gas mixture.\n    *   Total N₂ = N₂ (original) + N₂ (from N₂O)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (original) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, N₂ (original) = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the initial gas mixture formed by heating the salts was:\n        *   0.20 mol of H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol of N₂O (the oxidizing gas)\n        *   0.05 mol of N₂ (the original inert gas)\n\n3.  **Identify the original salts A and B.**\n    *   We need two salts, A and B, in an equimolar mixture, that decompose upon heating to produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O. The classic salts that fit these decomposition patterns are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n        *   **Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrite: `NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O`\n        *   **Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrate: `NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`\n    *   Let's assume the equimolar mixture contained `x` moles of each salt.\n        *   Decomposition of `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ produces: `x` mol of N₂ and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n        *   Decomposition of `x` mol of NH₄NO₃ produces: `x` mol of N₂O and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n    *   The total moles of products would be:\n        *   Moles of N₂ = `x`\n        *   Moles of N₂O = `x`\n        *   Moles of H₂O = `2x + 2x = 4x`\n    *   Now, we match this with the amounts we deduced from the experiment:\n        *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `x = 0.05`\n        *   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol => `x = 0.05`\n    *   The value `x = 0.05` mol is consistent for both. This confirms our hypothesis.\n    *   Let's check the amount of water: Moles of H₂O = `4x` = 4 * 0.05 mol = 0.20 mol. This perfectly matches our calculation from step 1.\n    *   Therefore, the two salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n4.  **Verify the total mass.**\n    *   We have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n```python\n# Molar masses: N=14.01, H=1.008, O=16.00\nmolar_mass_NH4NO2 = 14.01 + 4*1.008 + 14.01 + 2*16.00\nmolar_mass_NH4NO3 = 14.01 + 4*1.008 + 14.01 + 3*16.00\n\nmass_NH4NO2 = 0.05 * molar_mass_NH4NO2\nmass_NH4NO3 = 0.05 * molar_mass_NH4NO3\n\ntotal_mass = mass_NH4NO2 + mass_NH4NO3\nprint(f\"Total mass: {total_mass:.2f} g\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nTotal mass: 7.21 g\n</execute_result>\n    *   The calculated mass (7.21 g) is consistent with the given mass of 7.20 g. The small difference is due to rounding of atomic weights.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Analysis of the Experimental Data:**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance absorbs water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or sulfite ions that decompose to CO₂ or SO₂.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperature reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This means the gas mixture contained a substance that provided 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the copper. The reaction is of the form `Gas(with O) + Cu -> CuO + ...`. Common decomposition products from nitrogen-containing salts include N₂O and NO₂. N₂O is a likely candidate. The reaction would be `N₂O + Cu -> CuO + N₂`. In this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms to form CuO. Therefore, the gas mixture contained 0.05 mol of N₂O. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remained. At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C is inert and did not react in any tube. The total amount of N₂ gas exiting the setup is 0.10 mol. We know from step 3 that 0.05 mol of N₂ was produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = N₂ (from original mixture) + N₂ (from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (from original mixture) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the original gas mixture must have contained 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n**Summary of Decomposition Products:**\nThe initial heating of the salt mixture A and B produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**Identifying Salts A and B:**\n\nWe need to find two salts that, when heated, produce these gases. Common thermal decompositions of ammonium salts fit this profile:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: `NH₄NO₃(s) -> N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   Ammonium nitrite: `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\nLet's assume the mixture is equimolar, containing `x` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₃) and `x` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₂).\n\n*   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃, we get `x` mol of N₂O and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n*   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂, we get `x` mol of N₂ and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n\nAccording to our analysis of the products:\n*   Moles of N₂O = `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂ = `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2x + 2x = 4x` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThese amounts perfectly match the experimental results. Thus, the equimolar mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n**Mass Verification:**\nLet's check if the total mass matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\nThe mass matches exactly.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formula of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (let's say NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms (N)\n    *   4 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   2 Oxygen atoms (O)\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms (N)\n    *   4 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n    *   3 Oxygen atoms (O)\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<A>>>"
