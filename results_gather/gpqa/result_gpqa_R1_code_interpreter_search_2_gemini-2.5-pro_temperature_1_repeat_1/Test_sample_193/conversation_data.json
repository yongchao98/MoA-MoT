    "This problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Definition of the Partition Function**\nThe partition function Z for a system in thermal equilibrium is given by the sum over all possible microstates (i) of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE_i), where E_i is the energy of the microstate i and β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\n\n**2. Identifying the Microstates**\nThe system consists of three spins, each of which can take two values (+1 or -1). Therefore, the total number of microstates is 2^3 = 8. We can list all possible configurations of (S1, S2, S3):\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (-1, +1, +1)\n5. (+1, -1, -1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**3. Calculating the Energy for Each Microstate**\nWe now calculate the energy E for each of these 8 states using the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n*   **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThese two states are degenerate (have the same energy). Their contribution to Z is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n\n*   **States with two spins +1 and one spin -1:**\n    *   (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n*   **States with one spin +1 and two spins -1:**\n    *   (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nAll these six states are degenerate with energy E = J. Their contribution to Z is 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\n**4. Summing the Contributions to Find Z**\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the contributions from all states. We can group the states by their energy levels and degeneracies:\n*   Energy E1 = -3J, with degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy E2 = +J, with degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
