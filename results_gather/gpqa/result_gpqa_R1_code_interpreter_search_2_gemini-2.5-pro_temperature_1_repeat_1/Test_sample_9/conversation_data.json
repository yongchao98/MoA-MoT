    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the options provided.**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is a planet identical to Earth. Earth's average density is a well-known value, approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth (iron, silicates, etc.). However, because it is much more massive, its own gravity will be much stronger. This stronger gravity will compress the materials more tightly than they are compressed inside Earth. Increased compression for the same amount of material leads to a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be significantly greater than Earth's density.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is the opposite of case (c). It is made of the same materials as Earth, but it is less massive. The gravitational force is weaker, so the materials are less compressed. This means its average density will be lower than Earth's density. The uncompressed density of Earth-like material is around 4.0-4.4 g/cm³, so this planet's density would be somewhere between that value and Earth's 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **Step 2: Compare the densities.**\n    *   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to gravitational compression)\n    *   Density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression)\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude.**\n    By comparing the four options, the planet in option (c) is the only one that must have a density higher than Earth's. The principle of gravitational compression dictates that for planets of the same composition, the more massive planet will be denser. Therefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses will have the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
