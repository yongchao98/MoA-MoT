    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH(OCH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   There is a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This stereocenter is remote from the reaction site and will not be altered during the reaction.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products have one stereocenter in common (S at C5) and one that is different (S vs. R at C3). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images are called **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two new chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the relationships:\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are an **enantiomeric pair**. The reduction of the achiral starting material will produce them in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** The molecule pentane-2,4-diol has identical substituents on C2 and C4. Because of this symmetry, the (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. This type of molecule is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound (it can be superimposed on the (2R, 4S) isomer by a 180° rotation).\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe final mixture contains all five compounds produced:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will elute at different times, showing separate peaks.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute at a different time. This gives another peak. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇ ethers/alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times. We assume no accidental co-elution.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. It can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture will be resolved into a separate peak (assuming adequate column efficiency).\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other. The chiral column will resolve the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair into two separate peaks, and the meso compound (being a diastereomer) will also have its own unique peak. → **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
