    "*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Lorentz symmetry, which includes rotations and boosts, is a fundamental pillar of special relativity and any relativistic QFT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they respect Lorentz symmetry.\n\n*   **2. Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that also includes spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that underpins the construction of the Standard Model and, by extension, SMEFT. The Lagrangian of the theory, including all SMEFT operators, must be invariant under Poincare transformations.\n\n*   **3. CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry (Charge conjugation + Parity) is known to be violated in nature by the weak interaction within the Standard Model itself (e.g., in the Kaon system, explained by the CKM matrix). SMEFT is a framework that parameterizes all possible new physics effects, including potential new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators are *not* required to respect CP symmetry; indeed, studying CP-violating operators is a major goal of the SMEFT program.\n\n*   **4. CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in QFT. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT symmetry (Charge conjugation + Parity + Time reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed within this framework, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT would require a much more drastic modification of physics than what is assumed in SMEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the foundational principles of QFT upon which SMEFT is built, Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4) must be respected. CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
