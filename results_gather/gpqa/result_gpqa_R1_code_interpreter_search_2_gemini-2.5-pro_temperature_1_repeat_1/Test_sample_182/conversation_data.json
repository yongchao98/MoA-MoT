    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to deduce its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the parent structure, a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is the principal functional group, so it's located at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is located at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is located at position C5.\n\nLet's count the atoms to find the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   Let's count hydrogens on the ring and substituents: C1(-COOH)-H, C2(-CHO)-H, C3=C(H)-, C4=C(H)-, C5(-CH=CH2)-H, C6-H2. This gives 7 hydrogens on the ring structure.\n    *   1 hydrogen in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 hydrogen in the -CHO group.\n    *   3 hydrogens in the -CH=CH2 group.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the -CHO group.\n    *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Understand the reaction.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkane forms.\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   All oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n\n**3. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n\nApplying the reduction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2-CH3`).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The total number of carbon atoms remains the same, which is 10. The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n*   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) is **CnH2n**.\n*   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula C_c H_h N_n O_o X_x using the formula:\nIHD = c - h/2 - x/2 + n/2 + 1\n\nFor our product with the formula **C10H20**:\n*   c = 10\n*   h = 20\n*   x = 0 (no halogens)\n*   n = 0 (no nitrogens)\n\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined from the structure of the product. The IHD represents the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which means it has **one ring**.\n*   The molecule is fully saturated, meaning it has **zero π bonds**.\n*   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n```python\n# Molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n# The formula for the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is:\n# IHD = C - H/2 + 1 (for a hydrocarbon)\nC = 10\nH = 20\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nprint(int(IHD))\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactant's structure and molecular formula.**\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) at position C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A `formyl` group (-CHO) at position C2.\n    *   A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position C5.\n\nLet's determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Let's count them on the structure.\n    *   Ring hydrogens: H on C1, H on C2, H on C3, H on C4, H on C5, 2H on C6. Total = 7.\n    *   -COOH hydrogen: 1.\n    *   -CHO hydrogen: 1.\n    *   -CH=CH2 hydrogens: 3.\n    *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent combination. It performs the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The aldehyde (formyl) group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C=C) will be reduced to a single bond (C-C).\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to a single bond, forming an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\nThe reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, but the carbon skeleton remains.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The original substituents become: `-CH3` at C1, `-CH3` at C2, and `-CH2-CH3` (ethyl) at C5.\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the reaction only adds hydrogen atoms and removes oxygen, the number of carbon atoms remains 10. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane).\nThe general formula for a cycloalkane is **CnH2n**.\nFor our product with n=10 carbons, the molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells you the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\nIt can be calculated from the molecular formula (for a hydrocarbon C_c H_h):\nIHD = c - (h/2) + 1\n\nFor the product **C10H20**:\n*   c = 10\n*   h = 20\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD from the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated)\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
