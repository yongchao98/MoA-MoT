    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the mass dimension of `κ` and determine the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### **1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`), the action `S` is a dimensionless quantity. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d^4x L`\nThe spacetime volume element `d^4x` has a mass dimension of `[d^4x] = [length]^4 = [mass]^-4`. For `S` to be dimensionless (`[S]=0`), the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `+4`.\n`[L] = 4`\n\nAny term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term `L_int`, must have this mass dimension.\n`[L_int] = 4`\n\n### **2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Operators**\n\nWe need to determine the mass dimensions of each component in the interaction Lagrangian `L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`.\n\n*   **Fermion Field `ψ`:** The mass dimension of the fermion field `ψ` is determined from its kinetic term, `L_kinetic,fermion = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ`.\n    *   We know `[L] = 4`.\n    *   The partial derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of `[∂_μ] = 1`.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless.\n    *   So, `[L_kinetic,fermion] = [ψ̄] + [γ^μ] + [∂_μ] + [ψ] = 4`.\n    *   Since `[ψ̄] = [ψ]`, this becomes `2[ψ] + 0 + 1 = 4`.\n    *   `2[ψ] = 3`, which gives `[ψ] = 3/2`.\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor `F^{μν}`:** The mass dimension of the field strength tensor `F^{μν}` is determined from the kinetic term for the gauge field, `L_kinetic,gauge = -1/4 F_{μν} F^{μν}`.\n    *   We know `[L] = 4`.\n    *   So, `[L_kinetic,gauge] = [F_{μν}] + [F^{μν}] = 4`.\n    *   This implies `2[F^{μν}] = 4`, which gives `[F^{μν}] = 2`.\n\n*   **Sigma Matrix `σ_{μν}`:** The operator `σ_{μν}` is defined as `σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless matrices, their commutator `[γ_μ, γ_ν]` is also dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, `[σ_{μν}] = 0`.\n\n### **3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant `κ`**\n\nNow we can use the fact that the interaction term `L_int` must have a mass dimension of 4.\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_{μν}] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}] = 4`\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n`[κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nThe mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n### **4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed by power-counting, which relies on the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the Lagrangian.\n\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has `[g] > 0`, the interaction is called **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If `[g] = 0`, the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If `[g] < 0`, the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this theory, the coupling constant `κ` has a mass dimension of `[κ] = -1`. Since this is a negative mass dimension, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nA negative mass dimension coupling means that at high energies (in the ultraviolet regime), the effects of this interaction become increasingly strong. When calculating loop corrections in perturbation theory, this leads to divergences that become worse at each higher order, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to cancel them. This makes the theory lose its predictive power.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n*   The theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
