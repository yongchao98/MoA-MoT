    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Problem\nWe are given a vector field `f` and asked to compute the volume integral of its divergence, `∫_V (∇.f) dV`.\n\n### 2. Define the Vector Field\nThe problem states:\n- The magnitude of the field is `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n- The field has a non-zero component only along the radial direction.\n\nThis means the vector field `f` in spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)` can be written as:\n`f(r, θ, φ) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n### 3. Define the Volume of Integration\nThe integral is to be evaluated inside the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 4. Choose a Method for Evaluation\nWe need to calculate `∫_V (∇.f) dV`. There are two primary methods:\na) **Direct Calculation:** First, compute the divergence `∇.f`, and then integrate the resulting scalar function over the volume `V`.\nb) **Divergence Theorem:** Use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume `V`. The theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\n### 5. Analyze the Methods\n**Method (a) - Direct Calculation:**\nThe formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂(f_θ * sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂f_φ/∂φ`\nIn our case, `f_r = 1/r^2`, and `f_θ = f_φ = 0`.\nSo, `∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\nIf we naively integrate this, we get `∫_V 0 dV = 0`.\nHowever, this is incorrect. The field `f = r̂/r^2` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and its derivative is not defined there. The divergence is actually zero *everywhere except* at the origin. At `r=0`, the divergence is a 3D Dirac delta function, `∇.(r̂/r^2) = 4πδ(r)`. Integrating `4πδ(r)` over a volume that contains the origin yields `4π`. This method requires knowledge of generalized functions (distributions).\n\n**Method (b) - Divergence Theorem:**\nThis method is often simpler when dealing with singularities at the origin. The theorem allows us to evaluate the integral by considering only the boundary surface, thus avoiding the problematic point at `r=0`.\n\n### 6. Apply the Divergence Theorem\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\n- **Volume V:** A sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n- **Surface S:** The surface of this sphere.\n- **Vector Field f:** `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`. On the surface `S`, the radius `r` is constant and equals `R`, so `f|_S = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n- **Surface Element dS:** For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` points radially outward. Its magnitude is `R^2 sinθ dθ dφ`. So, `dS = (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n\nNow, we compute the dot product `f . dS` on the surface of the sphere:\n`f . dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] . [ (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\nSince `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ`\n\nNext, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sinθ dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral:\n1.  Integrate with respect to `θ`:\n    `∫_0^π sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n2.  Integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\nSo, the surface integral is `4π`.\n\n### 7. Final Conclusion\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is a classic one in physics, particularly in the context of Gauss's law for electricity, where the field `f` is analogous to the electric field of a point charge at the origin. The integral represents the total flux, which is proportional to the enclosed source strength.\n\nThe result `4π` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
