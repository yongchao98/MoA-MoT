    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid, especially when it is conjugated with a C=C double bond (which slightly lowers the frequency from the usual ~1710-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (contains both a C=C and a -COOH group).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n        *   Mass = (1 x atomic mass of C) + (2 x atomic mass of O) + (1 x atomic mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 x 12.01) + (2 x 16.00) + (1 x 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   The fragment [COOH]⁺ has a mass of 45. This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** The presence of this fragment strongly confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectroscopic data, we have definitively identified two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10**O**) and D (C6H12**O**), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). To distinguish between them, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency. The formula for a compound C*c*H*h*O*o* is:\n        *   DBE = c - (h/2) + 1\n    *   A DBE of 1 corresponds to one double bond or one ring. A DBE of 2 corresponds to two double bonds, one triple bond, two rings, or a combination.\n    *   Our molecule has a C=O bond (one degree of unsaturation) and a C=C bond (a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the correct formula must have a DBE of 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DBE for the remaining options:\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula):\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n    c = counts.get('C', 0)\n    h = counts.get('H', 0)\n    dbe = c - (h / 2) + 1\n    return dbe\n\nformula_a = \"C6H12O2\"\nformula_c = \"C6H10O2\"\n\ndbe_a = calculate_dbe(formula_a)\ndbe_c = calculate_dbe(formula_c)\n\nprint(f\"DBE for {formula_a}: {dbe_a}\")\nprint(f\"DBE for {formula_c}: {dbe_c}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nDBE for C6H12O2: 1.0\nDBE for C6H10O2: 2.0\n</execute_result>\n\n*   **For A (C6H12O2):** DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid). It does not account for the C=C double bond identified in the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n*   **For C (C6H10O2):** DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our finding of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Excellent. The code has confirmed the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) calculations.\n\n*   **Summary of Evidence:**\n    *   **FTIR & Mass Spec:** The compound is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), which contains two oxygen atoms. This eliminates C6H10O and C6H12O.\n    *   **FTIR & 1H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond (an alkene).\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The molecule must account for the unsaturation from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid (1 DBE) and the C=C bond of the alkene (1 DBE). Therefore, the total required DBE is 2.\n\n*   **Evaluating Final Options:**\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** The code confirmed its DBE is 1. This only accounts for the C=O bond and does not account for the C=C bond. This represents a saturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** The code confirmed its DBE is 2. This perfectly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds. This represents an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the analytical data is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
