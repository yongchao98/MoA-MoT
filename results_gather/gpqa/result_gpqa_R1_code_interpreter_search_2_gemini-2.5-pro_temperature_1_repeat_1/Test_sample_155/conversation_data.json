    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    CH₃CH₂CH₂      H\n             \\    /\n              C==C\n             /    \\\n            H      CH₂CH₂CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. The epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond. For a *trans*-alkene, this results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the attack can occur from the top or bottom face with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (H₂O) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The key principle here is the stereochemical outcome of adding a reagent to an alkene. A helpful way to remember this is:\n    *   *trans*-alkene + *anti*-addition → *meso*-product\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide, the *anti*-attack of water at either C4 or C5 will lead to the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Starting with the (4S,5S)-epoxide, the *anti*-attack of water will also lead to the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two chiral centers but possesses a center of inversion, making it a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n    CH₃CH₂CH₂      CH₂CH₂CH₃\n             \\    /\n              C==C\n             /    \\\n            H      H\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), resulting in *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We apply the stereochemical rule for a *cis*-alkene:\n    *   *cis*-alkene + *anti*-addition → *racemic* mixture of enantiomers\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   The epoxidation of the *cis*-alkene gives a *cis*-epoxide, which is a *meso* compound.\n        *   The *anti*-attack of water on this *meso*-epoxide can occur at two different carbons. Attack at one carbon gives the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other gives the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   These two products, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses achiral reagents, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The *meso*-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the HPLC will separate the *meso*-diol from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   **Observation:** One peak for the *meso*-diol and one peak for the racemic pair. **Total = 2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column can separate enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   **Observation:** One peak for the *meso*-diol, a second peak for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and a third peak for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer. **Total = 3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
