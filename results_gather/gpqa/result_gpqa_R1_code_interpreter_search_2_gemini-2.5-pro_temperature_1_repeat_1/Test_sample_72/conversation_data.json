    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts:\na) The relative speed between them.\nb) The total energy of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1 (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1 (v1) = 0.6c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2 (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2 (v2) = 0.5c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   'c' is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the velocities are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) between two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v1 and v2 in a stationary frame is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nLet's substitute the given values:\n*   v1 = 0.6c\n*   v2 = 0.5c\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\nv_rel = (1/7)c\n\nNow, let's convert the fraction to a decimal:\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857 c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\n**a) Calculate the energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   m1 = 2m\n*   v1 = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 (γ1):\n    γ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\n    γ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n    γ1 = 1 / √0.64\n    γ1 = 1 / 0.8\n    γ1 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate the energy E1:\n    E1 = γ1 * m1 * c²\n    E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\n    E1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**b) Calculate the energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   m2 = 3m\n*   v2 = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 (γ2):\n    γ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\n    γ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n    γ2 = 1 / √0.75\n    γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866\n    γ2 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Now, calculate the energy E2:\n    E2 = γ2 * m2 * c²\n    E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c²\n    E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**c) Calculate the total energy (E_total):**\n*   E_total = E1 + E2\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n*   E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc²\n*   E_total = 5.9641 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\nTo be more precise with the calculation without rounding γ2 early:\nγ2 = 1 / √0.75 = 1 / (√3 / 2) = 2 / √3\nE2 = (2/√3) * 3m * c² = (6/√3) * mc² = 2√3 * mc²\nE_total = (2.5 + 2√3) mc²\nE_total ≈ (2.5 + 2 * 1.732) mc² = (2.5 + 3.464) mc² = 5.964 mc²\n\n**5.

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. Both calculations must use the principles of special relativity since the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds.\n\n### **1. Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince both astronauts are moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$. The relative speed $v_{rel}$ of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n*   Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n*   Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) \\times c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**. These results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
