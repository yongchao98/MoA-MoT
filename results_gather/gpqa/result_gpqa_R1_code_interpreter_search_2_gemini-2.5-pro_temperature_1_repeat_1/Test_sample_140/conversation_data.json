    "*   **Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\n    The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a non-nucleophilic solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3). These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n    The amide ion (:NH2-) acts as a strong base and abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the leaving group (bromine).\n    In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine atom at C-1:\n    1.  **C-6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    2.  **C-2**, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\n    Due to the **kinetic isotope effect (KIE)**, the C-H bond is weaker and is broken more readily than the C-D bond. Therefore, abstraction of the proton from C-6 is faster and the major pathway, but abstraction of the deuteron from C-2 is also possible, leading to a minor pathway. This results in the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton from C-6, creating a carbanion at this position.\n        2.  This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion from C-1.\n        3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom remains at C-2. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n        ```\n              D(2)\n             /  \\\n        (1)C----C(6)  <-- Triple bond\n           ||    ||\n          (3)C----C(5)\n            \\  /\n             C(4)\n        ```\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C-2, creating a carbanion at this position.\n        2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion from C-1.\n        3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n        ```\n              C(2)===C(1)  <-- Triple bond\n             /    \\\n           (3)C----C(6)\n           ||    ||\n          (4)C----C(5)\n        ```\n\n*   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The nucleophile, which is another amide ion (:NH2-), now attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n    *   **Attack on 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n        The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group adds to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group adds to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring with the -NH2 group at position 1, the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Attack on benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n        The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne.\n        1.  Attack at either C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion**\n    Since both pathways occur (even if at different rates), we will have a mixture of all possible products. The distinct organic products formed are:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
