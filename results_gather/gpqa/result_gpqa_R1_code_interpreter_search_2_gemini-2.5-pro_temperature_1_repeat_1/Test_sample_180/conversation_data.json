    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Scenario:** The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core stops. This stoppage happened about 8.5 minutes ago, so the effect is just now observable on Earth.\n    *   **Question:** What is the approximate ratio of the neutrino flux in two energy bands: Band 1 (700-800 keV) and Band 2 (800-900 keV)? Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n    *   **Given Conditions:** All other reaction branches (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) continue as they were. Neutrino oscillations can be ignored.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch:**\n    *   The pp-chain has three main finishing branches. The key reactions for this problem are:\n        *   `³He + ⁴He → ⁷Be + γ` (This step is common to both pp-II and pp-III)\n        *   **pp-II Branch:** `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`. This produces monoenergetic `⁷Be` neutrinos at 0.861 MeV (861 keV).\n        *   **pp-III Branch:** `⁷Be + p → ⁸B + γ`, followed by `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe`. This produces a continuous spectrum of `⁸B` neutrinos with energies up to ~15 MeV.\n    *   The scenario states that the pp-III branch stops. This means the production of **⁸B neutrinos ceases completely**.\n    *   The `⁷Be` nuclei that would have gone into the pp-III branch are now all channeled into the pp-II branch. This slightly increases the flux of `⁷Be` neutrinos, but since pp-III is a very minor branch (~0.1% of `⁷Be` reactions in the Sun), we can consider the `⁷Be` neutrino flux to be effectively unchanged.\n    *   Other fluxes (`pp`, `pep`, `CNO`) are stated to remain as they were.\n\n3.  **Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Energy Band (Post-Change):**\n    *   With the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, we must identify the remaining sources in our energy bands.\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: No (max energy ~420 keV).\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: No (line is at 861 keV).\n        *   `pep` neutrinos: No (line is at 1.44 MeV).\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos: Yes. The `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos have continuous spectra that extend through this range.\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: Yes! The strong, monoenergetic line at 861 keV falls squarely in this band.\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos: Yes, their continuous spectra also cover this band.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Two Possible Interpretations of \"Energy\":**\n\n    *   **Interpretation A: True Neutrino Energy.**\n        If the question refers to the actual energy of the neutrinos themselves, the fluxes are:\n        *   Flux(Band 1) = Flux from `CNO` neutrinos.\n        *   Flux(Band 2) = Flux from `CNO` neutrinos + Flux from the `⁷Be` line.\n        *   The `⁷Be` line flux (~5 x 10⁹ ν/cm²/s) is vastly larger than the `CNO` continuous flux in a 100 keV band (which is on the order of 10³-10⁴ ν/cm²/s).\n        *   The ratio would be `Flux(CNO) / (Flux(CNO) + Flux(⁷Be)) ≈ Flux(CNO) / Flux(⁷Be)`. This results in a very small number, on the order of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁶. This does not match any of the provided options (10, 1, 0.1, 0.01). This suggests this interpretation is likely not what the question intends.\n\n    *   **Interpretation B: Detected Energy (Electron Recoil Spectrum).**\n        Neutrinos are typically detected by observing the energy of particles they scatter off, most commonly electrons (`ν + e⁻ → ν + e⁻`). The question might be sloppily phrased and could be referring to this observable energy. Let's analyze this case.\n        *   A neutrino of energy `E_ν` can transfer a maximum kinetic energy `T_max` to an electron (this maximum is called the Compton edge).\n        *   Let's calculate `T_max` for the dominant `⁷Be` neutrinos (`E_ν` = 861 keV).\n        ```python\n        # We use the formula T_max = E_nu / (1 + m_e*c^2 / (2 * E_nu))\n        # E_nu = 0.861 MeV\n        # m_e*c^2 = 0.511 MeV\n        E_nu = 0.861  # MeV\n        m_e_c2 = 0.511  # MeV\n        T_max = E_nu / (1 + m_e_c2 / (2 * E_nu))\n        print(T_max) # in MeV\n        ```\n        The calculation yields `T_max ≈ 0.664 MeV` or `664 keV`.\n        *   **Crucial Insight:** This means that `⁷Be` neutrinos **cannot** produce recoil electrons with energies in the 700-800 keV or 800-900 keV bands. Their contribution to the measured flux in these bands is zero.\n        *   With `⁸B` neutrinos turned off (by the premise) and `⁷Be` neutrinos unable to contribute to these energy bands, the only remaining sources for detected events in this energy range are `pep` and `CNO` neutrinos.\n        *   Both `pep` and `CNO` neutrinos have high enough energies to create recoils in the 700-900 keV range.\n        *   The `pep` neutrino line creates a flat electron recoil spectrum, meaning its contribution per keV is constant. The `CNO` neutrinos create a smooth, continuous recoil spectrum.\n        *   Therefore, the rate of detected events from these sources in two adjacent, narrow bands like 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV will be approximately the same.\n        *   Flux(Band 1) ≈ Flux(pep+CNO in band 1)\n        *   Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux(pep+CNO in band 2)\n        *   Thus, Flux(Band 1) ≈ Flux(Band 2).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Under the interpretation that the question refers to the detected electron recoil energy spectrum (which is the only interpretation that matches the given options), the flux in Band 1 is approximately equal to the flux in Band 2.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) is approximately 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
