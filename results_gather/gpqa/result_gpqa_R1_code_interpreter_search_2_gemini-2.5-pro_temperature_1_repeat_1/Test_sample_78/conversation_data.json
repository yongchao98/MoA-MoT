    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Product from the NMR Spectra**\n\n    The problem provides the NMR data for the product of the reaction. Our first step is to deduce the structure of this product. The starting material, Compound X, has the molecular formula C11H12O. Since the reaction is a rearrangement (a common reaction for epoxides under heat and with a base like DABCO), the product will have the same molecular formula, C11H12O.\n\n    *   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 197.7 ppm:** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically in a ketone or an aldehyde.\n        *   **δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C):** These eight signals are in the aromatic/alkene region (100-150 ppm).\n        *   **δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm:** These two signals are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two methyl (CH3) carbons.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** A methyl group singlet. Its chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (a tolyl group). This confirms the presence of a para-substituted tolyl group (p-tolyl).\n        *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** A second methyl group singlet. Since the 13C NMR indicates a ketone, this is likely a methyl ketone (an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n        *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and 6.75 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, indicate two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond that are coupled to each other (a -CH=CH- group).\n\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        We have the following fragments:\n        1.  A p-tolyl group: `CH3-C6H4-`\n        2.  A methyl ketone group: `-CO-CH3`\n        3.  A trans-disubstituted alkene group: `-CH=CH-`\n\n        Let's assemble these pieces to satisfy the molecular formula C11H12O. The only plausible structure is (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n        Structure:\n        ```\n              CH3\n             /\n        H3C-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n        ```\n        This structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data. For example, the vinylic proton next to the aromatic ring (Hβ) is more deshielded (δ 7.68) than the one next to the carbonyl group (Hα, δ 6.75). The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing vinyl ketone group are more deshielded (δ 7.71) than the meta protons (δ 7.08).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Reactant (Compound X) and the Reaction**\n\n    Now that we know the product, we need to figure out which of the given starting materials (Compound X) would rearrange to form it. The options are all epoxides containing a vinyl or styryl group. The reaction is the thermal rearrangement of a vinyloxirane. A known thermal rearrangement of vinyloxiranes of the type `R-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2` leads to α,β-unsaturated methyl ketones `R-CH=CH-CO-CH3`. The mechanism involves the formation of a dienol intermediate (`R-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH2`), which then tautomerizes to the more stable ketone.\n\n    Product: `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CO-CH3`\n    Based on the general reaction, the reactant must be: `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the Options**\n\n    Let's find the option that matches our required reactant structure `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`.\n\n    *   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH3)`. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. It would rearrange to a different product (1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one), which is inconsistent with the NMR data (e.g., would show an ethyl group, not two methyl singlets).\n    *   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** This name is ambiguous and likely corresponds to a compound with formula C10H10O, which does not match C11H12O.\n    *   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-`. The \"oxirane\" attached at the 2-position of the styryl group implies the structure is `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This perfectly matches the required reactant structure.\n    *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `Ph-C(CH3)=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. The resulting product would have a monosubstituted phenyl ring, which is inconsistent with the para-substituted pattern in the 1H NMR.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    The product of the reaction is unambiguously identified as 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one from the NMR data. The only reactant that can form this product under the given rearrangement conditions is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
