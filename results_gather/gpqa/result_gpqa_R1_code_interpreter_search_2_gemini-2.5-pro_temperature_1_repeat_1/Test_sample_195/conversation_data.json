    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For a conservative system, the total energy remains constant. In the relativistic case, the total energy (E_total) of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy. The particle's relativistic energy is given by E = γmc², where m is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). The potential energy (U) for a spring obeying Hooke's law is U = (1/2)kx², where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n    E_total = γmc² + U(x) = γmc² + (1/2)kx²\n\n2.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum amplitude.**\n    At the maximum amplitude, x = A, the mass momentarily comes to a stop. Therefore, its velocity is v = 0.\n    When v = 0, the Lorentz factor is γ = 1/√(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n    The potential energy is at its maximum: U_max = (1/2)kA².\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    E_total = (1)mc² + (1/2)kA² = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\n3.  **Analyze the system at the equilibrium position.**\n    At the equilibrium position, x = 0, the potential energy is zero: U = 0.\n    The speed of the mass is at its maximum, v = v_max.\n    The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, γ_max = 1/√(1 - v_max²/c²).\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    E_total = γ_max * mc² + 0 = γ_max * mc²\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy.**\n    Since the total energy of the system is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    mc² + (1/2)kA² = γ_max * mc²\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum Lorentz factor (γ_max).**\n    Divide the equation by mc²:\n    (mc² / mc²) + ( (1/2)kA² / mc² ) = γ_max\n    γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\n6.  **Solve for the maximum speed (v_max).**\n    Substitute the definition of γ_max back into the equation:\n    1/√(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\n    Now, we need to isolate v_max. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))\n\n    Square both sides to remove the square root:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\n    Finally, multiply by c² and take the square root to find v_max:\n    v_max = c * √[ 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))² ]\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for v_max is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
