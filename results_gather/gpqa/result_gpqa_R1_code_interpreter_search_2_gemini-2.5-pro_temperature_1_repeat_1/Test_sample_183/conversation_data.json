    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the structure and the relationship between the substituents:\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   C1: ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n    *   C3: nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are ortho (1,2) to each other.\n    *   tert-butyl and nitro are ortho (2,3) to each other.\n    *   Ethoxy and nitro are meta (1,3) to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, ortho-, para- director.\n    *   **tert-butyl (-tBu):** Moderate activator, ortho-, para- director. Very bulky, sterically hinders ortho substitution.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, meta- director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is sterically crowded, suggesting that a simple sequence of electrophilic aromatic substitutions on a benzene ring might not be efficient. Such syntheses often require special techniques like the use of blocking groups or starting with pre-substituted rings to control the regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Work Backwards (Retrosynthesis)**\n\nA common strategy to introduce an ethoxy group is via Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol.\n*   **Final Step:** `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. This corresponds to reagent `vii) NaOH/EtBr` in the options.\n*   The precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nThe phenol is often made from an aniline via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n*   **Step before:** `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` is converted to the phenol. This involves `NaNO2/HCl` (reagent v) to form a diazonium salt, followed by `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (reagent vi) to hydrolyze it to the phenol.\n*   The key intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nThe core of the problem is to synthesize `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`. This molecule has an amino, a tert-butyl, and a nitro group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Standard nitration or alkylation reactions on simpler precursors do not easily yield this specific isomer in high yield due to the directing rules of the substituent groups. For instance, nitrating o-tert-butylaniline would primarily give the 4- and 6-nitro isomers, not the desired 3-nitro isomer.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Provided Options**\n\nSince a straightforward synthesis is not apparent, let's analyze the chemical validity of the sequences given in the options. A valid sequence must have each step being chemically possible on the product of the preceding step.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n    *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene -> Forms mainly *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene due to sterics. (OK)\n    *   iii) Reduction of the nitro group -> *p*-tert-butylaniline. (OK)\n    *   iv) Nitration of *p*-tert-butylaniline. The NH2 and tBu groups both direct ortho to their own positions. The product would be 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. (OK, plausible)\n    *   v) Diazotization of the amino group. (OK)\n    *   vi) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. (OK)\n    *   vii) Williamson ether synthesis to form an ethoxy group. The product is 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. (OK)\n    *   viii) Sulfonation of this product. (Chemically possible)\n    *   ix) Desulfonation. (Chemically possible)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Every step in this sequence is chemically plausible. However, it produces the wrong isomer (a 1,2,4-substituted product, not the target 1,2,3-isomer) and has two redundant steps at the end.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   After step (v), the product would be a diazonium salt. Step (vi) attempts to sulfonate this diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and would decompose under the harsh conditions of sulfonation (fuming sulfuric acid). This step is chemically impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is invalid.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    *   After step (iii), the product is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene. It does not have an amino group. Step (iv) calls for diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is invalid.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   After step (v), the product is a diazonium salt. Step (vi) attempts to nitrate this salt. As with option B, diazonium salts are too unstable to survive nitration conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is invalid.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps. Option A is the only sequence where every reaction step is chemically valid and can be performed on the product of the previous step.\n\nAlthough the sequence in Option A leads to the synthesis of an incorrect isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) and includes two unnecessary steps at the end, it is the only choice that does not violate fundamental principles of chemical reactivity. It is highly likely that the question is flawed, either with a typo in the target molecule's name or in the options. However, when forced to choose the best option among the given choices, the only chemically coherent sequence is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
