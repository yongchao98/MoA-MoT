    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:** The problem specifies a diatomic molecule (XY) described by the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The energy levels for this model are given by the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I), with `I` being the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (or ground) state. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: v = 0 and J = 0.\n    *   Initial State: (v₀=0, J₀=0)\n    *   Initial Energy: E₀ = E(0, 0) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n3.  **Determine the Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For a rovibrational transition (which is what happens when a molecule absorbs a photon that excites its vibration), the selection rules are:\n    *   Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n    *   ΔJ = ±1\n    Starting from the ground state (J=0), the only possible rotational change is ΔJ = +1 (since J cannot be negative). Therefore, the final state must be:\n    *   Final State: (v₁=1, J₁=1)\n    *   Final Energy: E₁ = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states.\n    *   ΔE = E₁ - E₀ = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\n    *   ΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:** To find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`.\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (mₓ * mᵧ) / (mₓ + mᵧ)\n        Given: mₓ = 20 amu, mᵧ = 2 amu. (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg)\n        μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        I = μR²\n        Given: R = 2 angstroms = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        I ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        B = ħ² / (2I)\n        B ≈ (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE):** Now substitute the values into the equation for ΔE.\n    *   Vibrational part: ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   Rotational part: 2B ≈ 2 * (4.604 × 10⁻²³ J) = 9.208 × 10⁻²³ J\n    *   ΔE = ħω + 2B ≈ (4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 × 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.2189 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is much smaller than the vibrational energy).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):** The energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   p = ΔE / c\n    *   p ≈ (4.2189 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 × 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.406 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculation can be done precisely using a script.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Given values\nMx_amu = 20  # amu\nMy_amu = 2   # amu\nR = 2e-10    # meters (2 angstroms)\nw = 4e14     # rad/s\n\n# Constants from scipy for precision\nh_bar = const.hbar\namu_to_kg = const.physical_constants['atomic mass constant'][0]\nc = const.c\n\n# Convert masses from amu to kg\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\n\n# Calculate reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R**2\n\n# Calculate rotational constant (B)\nB = h_bar**2 / (2 * I)\n\n# Calculate the transition energy (Delta E) for the transition\n# from ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next allowed state (v=1, J=1)\n# Delta_E = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = h_bar*w + 2*B\ndelta_E = (h_bar * w) + (2 * B)\n\n# Calculate the photon's momentum (p)\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final momentum, formatted to match the answer choices\nprint(f\"{p:.1e} N*s\")\n```\n1.4e-28 N*s\n\nThe calculated momentum is approximately 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s.

    "The energy of the molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n\nwhere:\n*   v is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   J is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   B is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia.\n\n**1.

The selection rules for rovibrational transitions are Δv = +1 (for absorption) and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   Since the initial vibrational state is v=0, the final state must be v=1.\n*   Since the initial rotational state is J=0, the final state must be J=1 (because J cannot be negative, so ΔJ = -1 is not possible).\n\nTherefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\nE_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n**3.

Calculation of Physical Quantities:**\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant B, which in turn requires the moment of inertia I and the reduced mass μ.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (m_x * m_y) / (m_x + m_y)\n    m_x = 20 amu = 20 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) = 3.321 × 10⁻²⁶ kg\n    m_y = 2 amu = 2 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) = 3.321 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    μ = (3.321 × 10⁻²⁶ * 3.321 × 10⁻²⁷) / (3.321 × 10⁻²⁶ + 3.321 × 10⁻²⁷) kg ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    R = 2 angstroms = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    I = (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n**5.
