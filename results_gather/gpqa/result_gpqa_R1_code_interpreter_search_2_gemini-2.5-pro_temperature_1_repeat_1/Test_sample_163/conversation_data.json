    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` (M1) to the total mass of `system_2` (M2). This ratio is `M1 / M2`.\n\n2.  **Identify the System Type:** Both systems are described as eclipsing, double-lined spectroscopic binaries.\n    *   \"Eclipsing\" means the inclination of the orbit (`i`) relative to our line of sight is very close to 90°. This implies that `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   \"Double-lined spectroscopic\" means we can observe the Doppler shift and thus the radial velocity variations for both stars in the system. The given amplitudes (`K`) are the semi-amplitudes of these sinusoidal variations.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Formula:** The total mass (`M_total = m_1 + m_2`) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (`P`) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (`K_1`, `K_2`) by the following formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K_1 + K_2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to Both Systems:**\n    *   For `system_1`:\n        `M1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i1))`\n    *   For `system_2`:\n        `M2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i2))`\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to compute `M1 / M2`.\n    `M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   The term `(2 * π * G)` is a constant and cancels out.\n    *   Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `i1 ≈ i2 ≈ 90°`, which means `sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2) ≈ 1`. Therefore, the `sin^3(i)` terms also cancel out.\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    `M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) )^3`\n\n7.  **Extract the Given Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   `P1` = 2 years\n        *   `K1a` = 10 km/s\n        *   `K1b` = 5 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes: `K1_total = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   `P2` = 1 year\n        *   `K2a` = 15 km/s\n        *   `K2b` = 10 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes: `K2_total = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute the values into the simplified formula. Note that since we are taking ratios, the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) will cancel out, so no conversion to SI units is necessary.\n\n    `M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)^3`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value:** To find the decimal value, a simple calculation can be performed.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0   # km/s\n\n# Define the parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio M1/M2\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. This value is closest to the provided option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined using the formula derived from Kepler's third law, which relates the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) of the two stars. The formula is:\n\nM_total = [P * (K1 + K2)^3] / [2 * π * G * sin^3(i)]\n\nWhere:\n- `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n- `P` is the orbital period.\n- `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n- `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nSince both systems are described as \"eclipsing,\" it means we are viewing their orbits nearly edge-on. Therefore, the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°, and `sin(i)` is approximately 1. This simplifies the formula significantly.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2).\n\nM1 / M2 = { [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [2 * π * G * sin^3(i1)] } / { [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3] / [2 * π * G * sin^3(i2)] }\n\nThe term `2 * π * G` is a constant and cancels out. As `sin(i1)` ≈ 1 and `sin(i2)` ≈ 1, these terms also cancel out. The simplified ratio is:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]^3\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\nFor system_1:\n- P1 = 2 years\n- K1a = 10 km/s\n- K1b = 5 km/s\n- Sum of velocities (K1a + K1b) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\nFor system_2:\n- P2 = 1 year\n- K2a = 15 km/s\n- K2b = 10 km/s\n- Sum of velocities (K2a + K2b) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio. We can use a Python script for the calculation.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0 # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# Sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_total_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio M1/M2\n# M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * ((K_total_1 / K_total_2)**3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.43199999999999994\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.432.
