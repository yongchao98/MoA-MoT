    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the population of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes. The comparison is between the star without spots and the star with spots. This factor can be expressed as:\n    Factor = (Ratio of populations)_nospots / (Ratio of populations)_withspots\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels (E1 and E2) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   N₂/N₁ is the ratio of populations.\n    *   g₂/g₁ is the ratio of statistical weights of the levels (this term will cancel out in our final calculation).\n    *   E₂ - E₁ = ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the gas.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Factor Calculation:**\n    Let T₁ be the temperature of the photosphere when there are no spots, and T₂ be the temperature when there are spots.\n    *   Ratio₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n    *   Ratio₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n    The factor is Ratio₁ / Ratio₂:\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)] ]\n    The (g₂/g₁) term cancels out.\n    Factor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n    Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp[ -ΔE/(k*T₁) - (-ΔE/(k*T₂)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperatures (T₁ and T₂):**\n    *   The problem states that when the surface is not covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. We will use this as the characteristic temperature for the photosphere in this state. So, T₁ = 6000 K.\n    *   When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the *overall* effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. The problem implies a comparison between the two overall states of the star. Therefore, we use this overall effective temperature as the characteristic temperature for the spotted state. So, T₂ = 5500 K.\n    *   The information about the 40% spot coverage is the physical reason *why* the effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. For this simplified model, we use the effective temperatures directly. The star's radius and mass are extra information not needed for this calculation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference Term (ΔE/k):**\n    The energy difference ΔE is related to the wavelength (λ) of the transition by the formula ΔE = h * c / λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the term we need is:\n    ΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n    We are given:\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    We will use the following physical constants:\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    Now we have all the components to calculate the factor. The calculation can be performed efficiently and accurately using a Python script.\n\n    The script will:\n    a.  Define the constants h, c, and k.\n    b.  Define the given temperatures T₁=6000 K and T₂=5500 K, and the wavelength λ=1448 Å.\n    c.  Calculate `delta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (λ * k)`.\n    d.  Calculate `exponent = delta_E_over_k * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)`.\n    e.  Calculate `Factor = exp(exponent)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J.s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters\nT1 = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots (K)\nT2 = 5500.0  # Effective temperature with spots (K)\nwavelength = 1448e-10  # Wavelength in meters (1448 Å)\n\n# Calculate the term (Delta E / k)\ndelta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (wavelength * k)\n\n# Calculate the exponent for the final factor calculation\nexponent = delta_E_over_k * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = math.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor}\")\n```\n<<<\n4.500582963402431\n>>>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 4.5.

    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when the star goes from a state without spots to a state with spots.\n\n### **1. Identify the physical principle**\n\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In this condition, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, an upper level (level 2) and a lower level (level 1), is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂/N₁ is the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1.\n*   g₂/g₁ is the ratio of the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ = ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### **2. Set up the ratio for the two stellar states**\n\nWe need to compare the population ratio in two different states:\n*   **State 1: No spots.** The temperature is T₁ = 6000 K.\n    Ratio₁ = (N₂/N₁)_nospots = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n*   **State 2: With spots.** The effective temperature is T₂ = 5500 K.\n    Ratio₂ = (N₂/N₁)_withspots = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This factor is Ratio₁ / Ratio₂.\n\nFactor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂ = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)] ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nUsing the rules of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n\nFactor = exp[ -ΔE/(k*T₁) - (-ΔE/(k*T₂)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n### **3. Calculate the energy difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference is related to the wavelength (λ) of the transition by the formula ΔE = h * c / λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. The wavelength is given as λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n\nWe need the term (ΔE / k):\n\nΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n\n### **4. Substitute the values and calculate**\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the factor.\n*   h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s (Planck's constant)\n*   c ≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s (speed of light)\n*   k ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K (Boltzmann constant)\n*   λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   T₁ = 6000 K\n*   T₂ = 5500 K\n\nThe calculation is performed by the Python script:\n*   It calculates `delta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (wavelength * k)`.\n*   Then it calculates the exponent `exponent = delta_E_over_k * (1/T2 - 1/T1)`.\n*   Finally, it computes the factor `factor = math.exp(exponent)`.\n\nThe code output gives the value `4.506409276298925`.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.51. Comparing this value with the given options:\nA) ~7.8\nB) ~2.9\nC) ~4.5\nD) ~1.1\n\nThe calculated result is closest to option C. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not needed for this specific calculation, which focuses on the effect of the temperature change on the atomic level populations.\n\n<<<C>>>"
