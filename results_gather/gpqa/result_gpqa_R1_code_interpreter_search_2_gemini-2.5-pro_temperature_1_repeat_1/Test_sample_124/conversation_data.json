    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential energy is given as $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, this potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. It can be treated as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$. For a 3D system, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n3.  **Define the Principal Quantum Number:** Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n4.  **Identify the Energy Levels:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the smallest value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$, the minimum value for $n$ is $0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$).\n        Energy of ground state ($n=0$): $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next lowest energy, which is for $n=1$.\n        Energy of first excited state ($n=1$): $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        Energy of second excited state ($n=2$): $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        Energy of third excited state ($n=3$): $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. For the energy $E_n$, this is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$. This is a classic combinatorial problem.\n    The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level is given by:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** For the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n    *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\n    Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n    The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy eigenvalue is precisely its degeneracy.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect.\n    B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect.\n    C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10 - Correct.\n    D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
