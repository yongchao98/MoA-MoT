    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct mutation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This is achieved by inactivating the gene that synthesizes it. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Types of Mutations and Their Effects:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in one DNA base pair that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein. This may or may not affect protein function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid. It is not a reliable way to eliminate function.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three (e.g., 3, 6, 9). This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. Like a missense mutation, this may alter function but is unlikely to eliminate it completely.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is *not* a multiple of three. This shifts the grouping of bases into codons, changing every amino acid downstream from the mutation. It almost always leads to a premature stop codon and results in a truncated, non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to eliminate protein function.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in one DNA base pair that results in a premature STOP codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding strand). This causes translation to terminate early, producing a shortened, non-functional protein. This is also a very effective way to eliminate protein function.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and Mutants:**\n    The first step is to break the DNA sequence into three-letter codons and translate them into amino acids. The start codon is `ATG` (Methionine).\n\n    *   **Intact Gene Sequence:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... -3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser ...\n\n    Now, let's analyze each mutant in the same way, looking for the change and its consequence.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAC`.\n        *   **Translation:** `TTC` still codes for Phenylalanine (Phe), so the first change is silent. `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). So, Leucine (Leu) has been replaced by Tyrosine.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent) and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n        *   **Translation:** `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid (Phe). The resulting protein will only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). This protein is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... -3’` (Comparing to the intact sequence, this sequence is longer and scrambled after the first two codons, which is characteristic of a frameshift).\n        *   **Change:** A simple comparison shows the sequence `ATGTTT` is intact, but what follows is completely different and the mutant sequence is longer. This indicates an **insertion** has occurred, for example, a 'T' inserted after the `TTT` codon. `Intact: ...TTT CTC GCT...` -> `Mutant: ...TTT T(ins)A CGC T...`.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The entire reading frame after the second codon is shifted, leading to a completely different and meaningless amino acid sequence, and likely a premature stop codon will appear shortly after in the new frame. This will result in a non-functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’`\n        *   **Change:** Comparing to the intact sequence (`...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC` (missense), and the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n        *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of one codon (and a missense mutation). The protein will be missing the amino acid Glycine, and Leucine will be replaced by Tyrosine. Because the deletion is exactly three bases, the reading frame for the rest of the gene remains correct. While this will likely impact the protein, it's less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    To *eliminate* the compound, we need the mutation most likely to create a non-functional protein.\n    *   Mutant 1 (missense) and Mutant 4 (in-frame deletion) are less likely to cause a complete loss of function.\n    *   Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are both extremely effective at creating non-functional proteins. They are considered \"knockout\" mutations.\n\n    Both Mutant 2 and Mutant 3 would achieve the goal. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is arguably the most direct and certain method. It introduces a STOP signal at the third codon, ensuring that only a tiny, non-functional dipeptide is synthesized. This is a classic and definitive way to knock out gene function.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
