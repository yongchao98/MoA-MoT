    "To determine which of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to assess two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Observability:** Can the star be observed from the Paranal Observatory in Chile? This primarily depends on the star's declination (DEC).\n2.  **Brightness:** Is the star bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a 1-hour exposure? This depends on the star's apparent V magnitude.\n\nThe detectability threshold is given as S/N >= 10 for a 1-hour (3600s) exposure. According to the ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) documentation, this S/N is achieved for stars with an apparent magnitude V ≈ 16.5 mag. Therefore, any star with V < 16.5 will be detectable, provided it is observable from Paranal.\n\nLet's analyze each star:\n\n**1. Observability from Paranal Observatory**\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This means it has excellent visibility of the southern celestial hemisphere and objects with declinations down to about -84.6 degrees. For northern objects, the visibility limit is roughly up to a declination of +45 degrees, although objects become harder to observe as they approach this limit. A conservative limit for high-quality observations might be around DEC < +30 degrees.\n\n**Star Analysis:**\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination (DEC) of approximately -52° 41'. This is well within the observable range for Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky with an apparent V magnitude of -0.74. This is much brighter than the limiting magnitude of V ≈ 16.5.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Observability:** Polaris has a declination (DEC) of approximately +89° 15'. This is far too north to be observed from Paranal's latitude of -24.6°. It never rises above the horizon.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n**c) Star at (RA=0, DEC=0), M_V = 15, d = 10 pc**\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0° is on the celestial equator, which is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (V) using the distance modulus formula: V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10).\n    V = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0 mag.\n    Since V = 15.0 is brighter than the limit of V ≈ 16.5, it is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**d) Star at (RA=0, DEC=0), M_V = 15, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0° is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** V = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.5 mag.\n    This is much fainter than the V ≈ 16.5 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n**e) Star at (RA=0, DEC=0), M_V = 15, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0° is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** V = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.5 mag.\n    This is brighter than the V ≈ 16.5 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n**f) Star at (RA=0, DEC=0), M_V = 15, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Observability:** DEC = 0° is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** V = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.5 mag.\n    This is fainter than the V ≈ 16.5 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   Polaris: **Not Detectable** (not visible)\n*   Star (c): **Detectable** (V=15.0)\n*   Star (d): **Not Detectable** (V=21.5)\n*   Star (e): **Detectable** (V=13.5)\n*   Star (f): **Not Detectable** (V=18.5)\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars (Canopus, Star c, and Star e) are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
