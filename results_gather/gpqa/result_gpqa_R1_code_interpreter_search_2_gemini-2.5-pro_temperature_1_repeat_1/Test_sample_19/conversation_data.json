    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is that an interaction with a nucleus can be treated as an interaction with a single, free nucleon. Let's analyze each statement to see how it contributes to this core idea.\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the first and most fundamental part of the approximation. It simplifies the complex many-body problem into a one-body problem. Instead of considering interactions with correlated pairs of nucleons (meson exchange currents) or the nucleus as a whole, we assume the probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) interacts with just one nucleon at a time. This is essential for treating the nucleon as the primary target, similar to how it would be in a free-space experiment.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the nucleus were not \"transparent,\" the incoming probe might scatter off other nucleons before hitting the target nucleon (initial state interactions), or the struck nucleon might re-interact with the residual nucleus on its way out (final state interactions). Assuming transparency means we neglect these effects. This is crucial for ensuring that the process we observe is solely the result of the interaction with the \"selected\" nucleon, just as it would be if the nucleon were free and isolated.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it in the context of the quark model. The impulse approximation, however, is about the behavior of the *nucleon as a whole* within the *nuclear medium*. Whether the quarks inside the nucleon are treated as relativistic or non-relativistic is a separate issue related to nucleon form factors and deep inelastic scattering, not the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation can be used regardless of the specific model for the nucleon's internal structure. Therefore, this assumption is not a core component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. A nucleon inside a nucleus is bound by the strong force. This binding affects its energy and momentum. The approximation assumes the interaction happens over a very short timescale, so fast that the binding forces between the struck nucleon and the rest of the nucleus do not have time to act *during* the collision. The nucleon is effectively \"knocked out\" before the rest of the nucleus can react. This allows us to treat the nucleon as a free particle (with a specific initial momentum from its bound state) at the moment of interaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe assumptions that correctly define the impulse approximation are that the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), that there are no complicating interactions with the rest of the nucleus (2), and that the binding forces are negligible during the short interaction time (4). Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are the correct combination.\n\n<<<C>>>"
