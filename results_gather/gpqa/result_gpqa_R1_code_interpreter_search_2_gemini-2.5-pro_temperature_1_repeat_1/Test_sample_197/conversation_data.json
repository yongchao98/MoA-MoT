    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M.\n    *   Thiocyanate equilibrium concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M. The use of square brackets `[]` typically implies the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand.\n    *   Overall stability constants (β values) for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes from `Co²⁺` and `SCN⁻`:\n        *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`, `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]`, `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n    We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Substitute these into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Determine the Fraction of the Target Complex:**\n    The percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. The fraction, denoted as `α₂`, is:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, which means the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed to calculate the *percentage*.\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Value:**\n    Now, plug the given values into the formula for `α₂`.\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    First, calculate the individual terms in the denominator:\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    The denominator is the sum of these terms:\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n    `Numerator = 0.4`\n\n    Calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    Convert the fraction to a percentage:\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\n6.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%, which matches option A. To ensure accuracy, the calculation will be performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Thiocyanate concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The fraction of a complex [MLn] is given by alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i))\n# We want to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)2], which is alpha_2.\n\n# Numerator for alpha_2\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Denominator is the sum of all terms from n=0 to n=4 (with beta_0 = 1)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is a classic complexometric equilibrium problem.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria**\n\nThe cobalt(II) ions, Co²⁺, react with thiocyanate ions, SCN⁻, to form a series of complexes:\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` (the \"blue\" complex of interest)\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**2. Use stability constants to express concentrations**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and free ligand `[SCN⁻]` concentrations:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**3. Formulate the fraction of the desired complex**\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, in this case, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is often denoted as `α₂`.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into this equation:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term is common in the numerator and every term in the denominator, so it can be canceled out. This means the percentage distribution of the complexes depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the stability constants, not on the total cobalt concentration.\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Calculate the result**\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis result was confirmed by the python code execution, which yielded `16.916180326482287`.\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage is 16.9%. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
