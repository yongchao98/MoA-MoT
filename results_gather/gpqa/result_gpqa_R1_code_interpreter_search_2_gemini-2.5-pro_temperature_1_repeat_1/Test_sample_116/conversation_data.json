    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are:\n1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Restricted rotation around a single bond, leading to stable, non-superimposable conformers. This is common in substituted biphenyls.\nA molecule is **achiral** (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound where two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond. Each ring has two substituents at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n    *   At positions 2 and 2': a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   At positions 6 and 6': a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   The groups at the ortho positions (-COOCH₃ and -NO₂) are large and bulky. This bulkiness causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central carbon-carbon single bond.\n    *   This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar, creating a chiral axis. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. If we look at the molecule along the chiral axis (the C-C bond), the arrangement of substituents on one ring is not mirrored on the other in a way that creates a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   Let's identify potential chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.\n    *   Consider the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). Its four attachments are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. It exists as a pair of enantiomers ((R)- and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as diphenyl ketone. Its structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the C=O bond. While a C₂ axis alone doesn't rule out chirality, benzophenone can adopt conformations that have a plane of symmetry. More importantly, it is not possible to create a version of benzophenone that is a non-superimposable mirror image of the original. Its mirror image can always be rotated to superimpose on the original molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond (*trans* isomer).\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule is achiral because the plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
