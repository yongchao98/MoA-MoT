    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a vacuum chamber in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).\n    *   There are some residual gas molecules inside.\n    *   λ₁ is the mean free path of these **gas molecules colliding with each other**.\n    *   An electron beam is turned on.\n    *   λ₂ is the mean free path of the **electrons colliding with the gas molecules**.\n    *   The temperature and the number of gas molecules are constant.\n    *   The question asks for the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path (λ) is:\n        λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n        *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area that a moving particle presents to a target particle for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):**\n    *   In this case, a gas molecule is the moving particle, and other gas molecules are the targets.\n    *   The number density of target gas molecules is `n`.\n    *   Let's denote the collision cross-section for a molecule-molecule collision as σ₁.\n    *   The formula for λ₁ is: λ₁ = 1 / (n * σ₁)\n    *   A standard result from kinetic theory for a gas of identical molecules is that the collision cross-section is enhanced because both the projectile and target are moving. This introduces a factor of √2. The geometric cross-section involves the diameter of the molecules, *d*. A collision occurs if the centers of two molecules approach within a distance *d*. This is equivalent to a point particle colliding with a target of radius *d*. The cross-sectional area is πd².\n    *   Therefore, the effective cross-section is σ₁ = √2 * π * d², where *d* is the diameter of the gas molecule.\n    *   So, λ₁ = 1 / (n * √2 * π * d²)\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):**\n    *   In this case, an electron is the moving particle, and the gas molecules are the targets.\n    *   The number density of target gas molecules is still `n`.\n    *   Let's denote the collision cross-section for an electron-molecule collision as σ₂.\n    *   The formula for λ₂ is: λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n    *   Now we need to determine σ₂. The electron is, for all practical purposes, a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule). The gas molecule is a target with a diameter *d* (and radius r = d/2).\n    *   The electron is moving at relativistic speeds (1000 kV is a very high accelerating voltage), while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. We can therefore consider the gas molecules to be effectively stationary targets. The √2 correction factor is not needed here.\n    *   The geometric cross-section for a point-like electron to \"hit\" a spherical molecule of radius *r* is simply the area of the molecule's circular profile: σ₂ = π * r² = π * (d/2)² = (π/4) * d².\n    *   So, λ₂ = 1 / (n * (π/4) * d²)\n\n5.  **Compare λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    *   We have the expressions:\n        *   λ₁ = 1 / (n * √2 * π * d²)\n        *   λ₂ = 1 / (n * (π/4) * d²)\n    *   To find the relationship, let's take the ratio λ₂ / λ₁:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * (π/4) * d²)] / [1 / (n * √2 * π * d²)]\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = (n * √2 * π * d²) / (n * (π/4) * d²)\n    *   The `n`, `π`, and `d²` terms cancel out:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 / (1/4) = 4√2\n    *   Let's calculate the value: √2 is approximately 1.414.\n        λ₂ / λ₁ ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n    *   This means λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculation shows that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁. This makes intuitive sense. A tiny electron can more easily pass through a sparse gas of molecules without a collision than another bulky gas molecule can. The \"target\" is effectively smaller for an electron projectile than for a molecule projectile. A smaller collision cross-section (σ₂ < σ₁) leads to a larger mean free path (λ₂ > λ₁).\n    *   Our result is λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁. (Incorrect, our calculated ratio is ~5.66, which is not less than 1.22)\n    *   C) λ₂ < λ₁. (Incorrect, it's the other way around)\n    *   D) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁. (Correct. Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22)\n\nThe core principle is that the collision cross-section for a tiny, fast electron hitting a gas molecule (σ₂) is much smaller than the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (σ₁). Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ = 1/nσ), a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path. Therefore, λ₂ must be greater than λ₁. The detailed calculation confirms it is significantly greater, fitting the condition in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
