    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant throughout space. `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** The number of stars (`N`) within a certain volume (`V`) is given by `N = ρ * V`. Since `ρ` is a constant, the number of stars is directly proportional to the volume being considered: `N ∝ V`.\n\n3.  **Consider a Spherical Shell:** Let's find the number of stars (`dN`) located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from Earth, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). The relationship is:\n    *   `plx = 1/d` or `d = 1/plx`\n\n5.  **Relate the Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to find how the small thickness of the shell `dd` relates to a small range in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   Since we are concerned with the number of stars in a range, which must be a positive quantity, we can take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into our equation for the number of stars in the shell (`dN`).\n    *   Original equation: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (ignoring the negative sign as it only indicates direction):\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From the last step, we can rearrange the equation to find this:\n        `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
