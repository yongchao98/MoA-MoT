    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations.\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 moles.\n*   **Total volume after dilution:**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\n*   **Concentration of diluted acetic acid:**\n    *   Molarity = Moles / Volume\n    *   Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\nSo, the titration involves 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M CH₃COOH with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n*   **pH = pKa + log([conjugate base] / [acid])**\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n\n*   **pKa = -log(Ka)**\n*   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\nNow, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles, which is determined by the percentage of titration.\n\n*   [conjugate base] / [acid] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n*   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻.\n\n*   **Determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    *   0.001 moles = 0.1 mol/L × V_NaOH\n    *   V_NaOH = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic:\n\n*   **CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)**\n\nWe need to calculate the concentration of OH⁻ using the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n\n*   **Calculate Kb:**\n    *   Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48\n    *   **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n\n# Initial moles of acid\nmoles_acid = 0.05 * 0.020 # 0.001 mol\n\n# Volume of diluted acid\nV_acid_diluted = 0.040 # L\n\n# Volume of NaOH at equivalence\nV_naoh_eq = moles_acid / 0.1 # 0.01 L\n\n# Total volume at equivalence\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_naoh_eq # 0.05 L\n\n# Concentration of acetate (conjugate base) at equivalence\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / V_total_eq # 0.02 M\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [Acetate]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Acetate])\noh_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(oh_concentration)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
