    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   **Pyran-2-one:** A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at position 2.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n*   **Chirality:** Carbon 4 is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups. The product is specified as either the (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n\nThe structure is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid derivative. Let's number the precursor acid chain:\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\nThe cyclization connects the oxygen of the C5-hydroxyl group to the carbonyl carbon (C1), forming a six-membered ring. The original chiral center at C3 of the acid becomes the C4 chiral center of the lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options for the starting materials are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This name describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted to an isobutyl ester. The structure is:\n`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which can be either (R) or (S).\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. Its key property is its **chemoselectivity**: LiBH₄ reduces esters but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids under standard conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is unreactive (it gets deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction).\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  --[LiBH₄]--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    2.  The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  The H⁺ (acid workup) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the stable six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the product). Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is another reducing agent with a different chemoselectivity. Borane is excellent at reducing **carboxylic acids** but is much slower at reducing esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains intact.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  --[BH₃]--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    2.  The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  This hydroxy-ester then undergoes intramolecular transesterification (the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl), eliminating isobutanol to form the same six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center. The configuration is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the (R) isomer.\n*   Starting material B is the (S) isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
