    "This problem requires the identification of the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the key concepts and variables:\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Source's motion:** The charge follows a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   **Observer's position (field point):** `r`.\n*   **Observer's time (observation time):** `t`.\n*   **Retarded time (`tr`):** The time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at `(r, t)`. The signal travels at the speed of light `c`.\n*   **Retarded position:** The position of the charge at the retarded time, `s(tr)`.\n*   **Vector from retarded position to observer:** `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   **Distance from retarded position to observer:** `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   **Causality condition:** The time `t` and retarded time `tr` are related by the time it takes for light to travel the distance `d`: `t - tr = d/c`.\n*   **Velocity of the charge at retarded time:** `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n\n### 2. Recall the general formulas for retarded potentials:\nThe potentials for a general time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are given by:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `tr'` is the retarded time for each source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Apply the formulas to a moving point charge:\nFor a point charge `q` moving along `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and performing the integration (a non-trivial step that accounts for the fact that `tr'` depends on `r'`) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 4. State the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\nThe standard textbook result for the potentials is:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d·v/c)]`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q*v / (d - d·v/c)]`\n\nHere, all source-related quantities (`d`, `d`, `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 5. Manipulate the expressions to match the given options:\nLet's work with the denominator of the standard expressions:\n`d - d·v/c`\nWe can find a common denominator `c`:\n`d - d·v/c = (d*c - d·v) / c`\n\nNow substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n*   **Scalar Potential V:**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((d*c - d·v) / c)]`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (d*c - d·v)]`\n    This can be rewritten as: `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ * (d*c - d·v))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential A:**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q*v / ((d*c - d·v) / c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc*v / (d*c - d·v)]`\n    This can be rewritten as: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ * qc * v) / (4π * (d*c - d·v))`\n\n### 6. Compare with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ * (d*c - d·v)),  A(r,t) = (μ₀ * qc * v) / (4π * (d*c - d·v))**\n    This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n*   **B) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ * r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) * V(r,t)**\n    This is incorrect. `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge and `r` is not defined as the retarded distance.\n\n*   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ * r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) * V(r,t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as B; it uses the static potential. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for the full Liénard-Wiechert potentials, applying it to the wrong `V` is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ * (d*c + d·v)),  A(r,t) = (μ * qc * v) / (4π * (d*c + d·v))**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of the correct `-`. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect on the apparent source volume. Also, `μ` is written instead of `μ₀`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
