    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The planet's gravity causes the star to \"wobble\" around the common center of mass. This wobble results in a change in the star's velocity along our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity (`v_r`).\n\nThe Doppler effect relates this radial velocity to the observed wavelength shift (`Δλ`) of a spectral line with a rest wavelength (`λ_0`):\n\n`Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c`\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem states a \"periodic shift of up to 5 miliangstrom\". This maximum shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the amplitude of the RV signal, denoted as `K`.\n\nTherefore, the RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift `Δλ_max`.\n\n`K ∝ Δλ_max`\n\nFor the two systems, we can write the ratio of their RV amplitudes as:\n\n`K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\nGiven the values:\n`Δλ_1 = 5` miliangstrom\n`Δλ_2 = 7` miliangstrom\n\n`K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7`\n\n### 2. Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between the RV amplitude `K` and the orbital period `P`. The formula for the RV amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n\n`K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / ((M_s + M_p)^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3)`\n\nwhere:\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n- `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n- `M_s` is the mass of the star.\n- `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n- `P` is the orbital period.\n\nThe quantity `M_p * sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is what can be determined from RV measurements.\n\n### 3. Apply the Conditions from the Problem\n\nLet's analyze the given information in the context of this formula:\n- **\"two stars with exactly the same masses\"**: `M_s1 = M_s2`.\n- **\"both with masses similar to that of Neptune\"**: This is the key. In RV studies, the \"mass\" determined is the minimum mass, `M_p * sin(i)`. It is the most reasonable assumption that the problem implies this measured quantity is the same for both planets. So, `(M_p * sin(i))_1 ≈ (M_p * sin(i))_2`.\n- Since `M_s` and `M_p` are the same for both systems, the term `(M_s + M_p)` is also the same.\n\nWith these conditions, all terms in the formula for `K` are constant for both systems except for `P`. This leaves us with a simple proportionality:\n\n`K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nFrom the proportionality `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, we can write the relationship for the two planets as:\n\n`K_1 / K_2 = (P_1)^(-1/3) / (P_2)^(-1/3) = (P_2 / P_1)^(1/3)`\n\nWe want to find the ratio `P_2 / P_1`. We can rearrange the equation:\n\n`P_2 / P_1 = (K_1 / K_2)^3`\n\nNow, substitute the ratio of the RV amplitudes we found in Step 1:\n\n`P_2 / P_1 = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nTo get the numerical answer, we compute the value of `(5/7)^3`.\n\n```python\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644324937181977\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.364. This matches option B.\n\nThe result being less than 1 means that the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1, which is consistent with the fact that it induces a larger radial velocity shift in its star.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The observed shift in wavelength (`Δλ`) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (`v_r`). The maximum wavelength shift (`Δλ_max`) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity variation, which is denoted as `K`.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7`\n\n2.  **The Formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude `K` is given by the formula:\n    `K = [ (2πG) / P ]^(1/3) * [ M_p * sin(i) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ]`\n    Where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_s` is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight. The RV method measures the *minimum mass*, `M_p * sin(i)`.\n\n3.  **Applying the Problem's Conditions:**\n    We are given the following information, which simplifies the formula:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_s1 = M_s2`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses as detected by the RV method. This implies their minimum masses are the same: `(M_p * sin(i))₁ = (M_p * sin(i))₂`.\n    *   Since the planet masses (`M_p`) are much smaller than the star masses (`M_s`), the `(M_s + M_p)` term is dominated by `M_s` and is essentially the same for both systems.\n\n    With all other terms being constant for both systems, the relationship between `K` and `P` simplifies to:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    We can now set up a ratio for the two planets:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the periods, `P₂ / P₁`. To do this, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n    Now, we substitute the ratio of the RV amplitudes we found in the first step:\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nThe question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is precisely the ratio `P₂ / P₁`.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nOur calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
