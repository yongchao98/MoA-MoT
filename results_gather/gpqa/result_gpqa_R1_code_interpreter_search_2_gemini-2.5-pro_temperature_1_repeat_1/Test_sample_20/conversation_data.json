    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two constitutional isomers, most commonly the keto and enol forms. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a molecule must possess an **alpha-hydrogen**, which is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon).\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n        *   The alpha-carbons are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds. They are each bonded to three other carbon atoms and have no hydrogen atoms attached.\n        *   Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it **cannot** undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Its structure is a saturated six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The alpha-carbons are at positions 2, 4, and 6. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group.\n        *   These alpha-carbons have two hydrogen atoms each.\n        *   Because it possesses alpha-hydrogens, it **can** undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and thus very stable compound.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and **will show optical isomerism** (it has two enantiomers, R and S).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Its structure is the *trans* isomer of an alkene: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that lies in the plane of the molecule itself. It also has a center of inversion.\n        *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
