    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial and Final States**\n    *   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial kinetic energy is 0 and its initial momentum is 0.\n    *   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's define `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies**\n    *   We are given the initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is: `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Now we have a system of two equations for the fragment rest-mass energies (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`):\n        1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`\n        2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   Substitute the first equation into the second: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`, which gives `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for `m2*c^2`: `m2*c^2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for `m1*c^2`: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before must equal the total energy after. The energy released in the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This released energy is called the Q-value.\n        *   `E_initial = E_final`\n        *   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n        *   `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n        *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the fragments fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n        *   `p1 = p2` (in magnitude).\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)**\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Since `p1 = p2`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n    *   `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    *   `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n    *   This gives the ratio of kinetic energies: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`. So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   We also know `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`.\n    *   Substituting for `T2`: `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`.\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = Q`.\n    *   `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n    *   In special relativity, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Rearranging gives `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   From momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n    *   `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Using the difference of squares: `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   From energy conservation, the sum of the total energies of the fragments is the initial energy of the parent nucleus: `E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Now substitute the known values:\n        *   `m1*c^2 - m2*c^2 = 198 GeV - 99 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n        *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n        *   `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (99 GeV) * (297 GeV)`.\n    *   `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV`.\n    *   We now have another system of two equations for the total energies `E1` and `E2`:\n        1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n        2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n    *   Add the two equations: `2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`, which gives `E1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n    *   The kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    *   `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference**\n    *   Difference = (Correct T1) - (Classical T1)\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   The question asks for the answer in MeV. Convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    *   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculations are verified using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Initial parameters from the problem\nE_initial_GeV = 300.0  # Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus in GeV\nm_sum_fraction = 0.99  # Sum of fragment masses is 99% of the initial mass\nm1_to_m2_ratio = 2.0   # Rest-mass of fragment 1 is 2x that of fragment 2\n\n# 1.

    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus with mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n    *   Initial total energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the fragment rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n\n*   From the given information, the sum of the rest-mass energies is:\n    `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We also know the ratio of their masses: `m1 = 2*m2`, which implies `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`.\n*   Now we solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  Substitute the second equation into the first: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    2.  This simplifies to `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n    3.  Solving for the lighter fragment's rest-mass energy: `m2*c^2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV`.\n    4.  Solving for the more massive fragment's rest-mass energy: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The energy released in the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n    `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    So, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus was at rest (`P_initial = 0`), so the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n    `p1 = p2`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n\n*   From `p1 = p2`, we have `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n*   Substituting the classical formula: `2*m1*T1_classical = 2*m2*T2_classical`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   We know `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for `T2`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n\n*   From momentum conservation, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Using the energy-momentum relation: `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   Rearranging: `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   Using the difference of squares: `(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n*   From energy conservation, the total final energy `E1 + E2` equals the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   We calculated: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Substitute these values into the equation:\n    `(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    `(E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)`\n    `E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`.\n*   Now we have another system of equations for the total energies `E1` and `E2`:\n    1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n    2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n*   Add the two equations to solve for `E1`: `2*E1 = 398.01 GeV`, which gives `E1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6.
