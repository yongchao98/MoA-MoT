    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement.**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   This tells us the quantum numbers for the system:\n        *   Orbital angular momentum of electron 1: $l_1 = 1$\n        *   Orbital angular momentum of electron 2: $l_2 = 1$\n        *   Total orbital angular momentum: $l = 2$\n        *   Z-component of the total orbital angular momentum: $m = -1$\n    *   A measurement is made on the z-components of the orbital angular momentum of each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state corresponding to the measurement outcome.**\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{z}$ is given by $m_z \\hbar$.\n    *   For $L_{1z}$, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For $L_{2z}$, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled basis state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics.**\n    *   The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$, to be in the state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n        $P = |\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^2$\n    *   We need to evaluate the inner product $\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Use the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    *   The total angular momentum operator in the z-direction is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The quantum numbers are related in the same way: $m = m_1 + m_2$. This relationship must hold for any component in the expansion of a coupled state into uncoupled states.\n    *   For the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final measured state $|\\phi\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The total magnetic quantum number for this state would be $m' = m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is different from the total magnetic quantum number of the state we are measuring for ($m'=-2$), the initial state cannot have any component of the final state.\n\n5.  **Formal argument using orthogonality.**\n    *   The initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, the inner product $\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle = 0$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    *   $P = |\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    *   The joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0. This is because the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum is violated.\n\nThis can also be seen by looking at the Clebsch-Gordan expansion of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, 0\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, -1\\rangle|1, 0\\rangle$\nThis expansion shows that the state is a superposition of two possibilities:\n1.  Electron 1 in state $m_1=0$ and electron 2 in state $m_2=-1$.\n2.  Electron 1 in state $m_1=-1$ and electron 2 in state $m_2=0$.\nThere is no term in this expansion that corresponds to the state $|1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$ (where $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$). Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
