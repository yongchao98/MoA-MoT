    "The user wants to find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass m in a 2D potential given by:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Convert the potential from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). This often simplifies the problem, especially when the potential can be separated into functions of x and y.\n2.  Recognize the form of the potential in Cartesian coordinates. If it is a sum of potentials for independent systems, the total energy will be the sum of the individual energies.\n3.  Calculate the energy spectrum for each independent system.\n4.  Combine the energies to find the total energy spectrum of the particle.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates**\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nWe can substitute these into the given potential V(r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 k(r^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2\n\nSubstituting the Cartesian expressions:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\n\nNow, we simplify the expression by grouping terms with x and y:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the form of the potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis shows that the potential is a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one along the x-axis and one along the y-axis. This means the Schrödinger equation for the system is separable. The total energy E of the particle will be the sum of the energies from the x-motion (E_x) and the y-motion (E_y).\nE = E_x + E_y\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the energy spectrum for each oscillator**\n\nThe energy levels of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(z) = 1/2 k'z^2 are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(k'/m).\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We can write this in the standard form 1/2 k_x x^2, where the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k.\n    The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is:\n    ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy levels for the x-motion are:\n    E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m), where n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. The spring constant is k_y = k.\n    The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is:\n    ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy levels for the y-motion are:\n    E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m), where n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n**Step 4: Combine the energies**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_x and E_y:\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nNow, we factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\nE = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur calculated energy spectrum matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
