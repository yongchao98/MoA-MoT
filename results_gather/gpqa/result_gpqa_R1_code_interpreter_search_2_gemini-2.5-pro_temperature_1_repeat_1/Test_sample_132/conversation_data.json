    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates completely in water to yield K+ and H2PO4- ions.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely in water to yield 2 Na+, HPO4^2-, and 2 H2O.\n    *   The key species for the buffer are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate) and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate).\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L.\n    *   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g; Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g; Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol.\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles.\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles.\n\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H2PO4-  ⇌  H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n    *   We can use the Ka2 expression to find [H+]:\n        Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   Rearranging for [H+]:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n        [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    *   The concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-):\n        HPO4^2-  ⇌  H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n    *   The Ka3 expression is:\n        Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   Since Ka3 is very small, the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates is negligible. We can therefore use its initial concentration in this calculation. We use the [H+] calculated from the buffer in the previous step.\n        [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10^-8 M)\n\nLet's perform the precise calculation using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\n\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration.\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n\n>>>6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each salt:**\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Since KH₂PO₄ fully dissociates, this gives 0.007348 moles of H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Since Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O fully dissociates, this gives 0.005618 moles of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n*   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n*   Initial concentration of [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n*   Initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer:**\n*   The buffer is formed by the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n*   Using the expression for Ka₂:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   We can rearrange to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration:**\n*   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n*   Using the expression for Ka₃:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   We rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   We use the [H⁺] calculated from the buffer and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since its dissociation is negligible due to the very small Ka₃ value).\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches the result from the code interpreter.\n\n<<<B>>>"
