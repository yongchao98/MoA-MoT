    "*   **Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the para-substituted product is typically the major product.\n    *   **Product 1:** *p*-nitrotoluene (1-methyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. MnO2 in strong acid is a powerful oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the benzylic methyl group (-CH3) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Product 2:** *p*-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 (*p*-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n    *   **Analysis:** *p*-Nitrobenzoic acid is a carboxylic acid, and sodium hydroxide is a strong base. The primary and most rapid reaction will be an acid-base neutralization. The acid will donate a proton to the hydroxide ion.\n        *p*-NO2-C6H4-COOH + NaOH → *p*-NO2-C6H4-COO⁻ Na⁺ + H₂O\n    *   Acetone in this context acts as the solvent for the reaction. While acetone can react with NaOH to form an enolate, this is a much slower process and the enolate would not readily react with the deprotonated carboxylate. Therefore, the significant product formed is the salt of the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 3:** The *p*-nitrobenzoate anion.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n    *   **Structure:** The *p*-nitrobenzoate anion has a benzene ring with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) at one position (let's say C1) and a nitro group (-NO₂) at the para position (C4). The molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n        1.  **Principal Axis (Cn):** There is a C₂ axis passing through the C1 and C4 atoms and the attached C-COO and C-NO₂ bonds.\n        2.  **Perpendicular C₂ Axes:** There are two additional C₂ axes perpendicular to the principal axis. One lies in the plane of the molecule, bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. The other is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the ring. The presence of a principal C₂ axis and two perpendicular C₂ axes means the molecule belongs to the D₂ point group family.\n        3.  **Horizontal Plane (σh):** The plane of the molecule itself is a mirror plane, perpendicular to the C₂ axis that is perpendicular to the ring. This is a horizontal plane of symmetry (σh).\n        4.  **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule has a center of inversion at the center of the benzene ring.\n        5.  **Vertical/Dihedral Planes (σv/σd):** There are two vertical mirror planes that contain the principal C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule, and the other is perpendicular to it.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A molecule with D₂ symmetry that also possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) belongs to the **D₂h** point group.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of Product 3 (*p*-nitrobenzoate anion) is D2h.\n\n<<<C>>>"
