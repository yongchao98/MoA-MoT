    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons and basic groups.**\n    The sum of the integrations is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n    Let's check the molecular formulas for the options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate: C5H8O2. The number of protons is 8. This matches.\n    *   Butenyl acetate: C6H10O2. The number of protons is 10. This does not match.\n    Therefore, we can immediately rule out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm.**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons and is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group of an ester or ketone (an acetyl group, CH3-C=O). This is the acetate part of the molecule and is present in both propenyl acetate options.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the signals in the alkene region (5.0-8.0 ppm) and the coupling constant (J).**\n    *   We have two signals in this region: 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. These are the two protons on the C=C double bond of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is one of the vinyl protons. It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one other proton. The coupling constant, J, is 16.0 Hz.\n    *   **The value of the coupling constant (J) is crucial for determining stereochemistry.** For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A *trans* relationship typically has a large coupling constant, J = 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A *cis* relationship has a smaller coupling constant, J = 6-12 Hz.\n    *   Since J = 16.0 Hz, this strongly indicates a **trans** configuration. This allows us to distinguish between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The compound must be Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the structure by analyzing all signals for Trans-propenyl acetate.**\n    *   **Structure:** CH3(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is the acetate methyl group, CH3(a). It is a singlet as it has no adjacent protons. This matches.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This must be the methyl group on the double bond, CH3(d). It is a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single adjacent proton, H(c). This matches.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This must be the proton H(c). It is coupled to H(b) (giving a doublet, d) and to the three protons of CH3(d) (giving a quartet, q). Therefore, its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This must be the proton H(b). It is attached to the oxygen atom, which is strongly electron-withdrawing and deshields the proton, shifting it far downfield. It is coupled only to H(c), so it appears as a doublet (d). The large coupling constant J = 16.0 Hz confirms the trans geometry with H(c). This matches perfectly.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** All features of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
