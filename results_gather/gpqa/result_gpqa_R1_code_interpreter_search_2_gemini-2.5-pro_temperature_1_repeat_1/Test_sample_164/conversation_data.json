    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core task is to create branched polyethylene using only ethylene as a reactant. This requires a dual-catalyst system.\n    *   **Catalyst 1:** Polymerizes ethylene and a comonomer into a polymer chain. This is the main polymerization catalyst, likely a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene type, which the scientist already has for making high-density (linear) polyethylene.\n    *   **Catalyst 2:** Oligomerizes ethylene into short alpha-olefins (e.g., 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene). These alpha-olefins then act as comonomers for Catalyst 1.\n    *   The overall process is a tandem reaction in a single pot: `Ethylene --(Catalyst 2)--> 1-Hexene` and `Ethylene + 1-Hexene --(Catalyst 1)--> Branched Polyethylene`.\n    *   The goal is to identify the correct statement among the four options provided by a senior scientist.\n\n2.  **Analyze Statement A: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene (e.g., trimerization to 1-hexene).\n    *   The most well-known and industrially successful catalysts for this specific reaction are based on chromium.\n    *   These chromium-based catalysts are activated by cocatalysts, which are typically aluminum-alkyl compounds like triethylaluminum (TEA) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO).\n    *   Therefore, aluminum-based activators are not only compatible but are often essential for the oligomerization step.\n    *   This statement is factually incorrect.\n\n3.  **Analyze Statement B: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   Noble metals include palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), etc.\n    *   Catalysts based on some late transition metals, including palladium, are known for ethylene polymerization. However, they typically function via a \"chain-walking\" mechanism, which produces a hyperbranched polymer with a variety of branch lengths and structures directly from ethylene. They are not typically used in dual-catalyst systems to generate a specific alpha-olefin comonomer.\n    *   So, while they \"can be used\" to make branched polyethylene from ethylene, they are not suitable for the specific tandem mechanism described (generating *regular* branches by creating a specific comonomer). Furthermore, their extreme cost makes them non-viable for producing a commodity plastic like polyethylene on an industrial scale.\n    *   This statement is misleading in the context of the problem and likely incorrect as a practical solution.\n\n4.  **Analyze Statement D: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   Group VIa (or Group 6) consists of Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n    *   Chromium-based catalyst systems are the cornerstone of modern industrial processes for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene. This is the most common route for in-situ generation of comonomer for LLDPE production.\n    *   These systems require a chromium source, a specific ligand (e.g., based on pyrrole), and an activator (e.g., an aluminum-alkyl), confirming the \"in combination with specific activators\" part of the statement.\n    *   This statement accurately describes the key chemical technology that enables the desired reaction. It is a correct and fundamental statement.\n\n5.  **Analyze Statement C: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   \"Such combined systems\" refers to the tandem catalysis approach for producing branched polyethylene (LLDPE) from ethylene alone.\n    *   Companies like Chevron Phillips Chemical and Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil) have developed and operate industrial processes that use this principle. For instance, Chevron Phillips has world-scale plants in Cedar Bayou, Texas, that can produce 1-hexene on-purpose and use it in polyethylene production, including tandem systems.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is also factually correct.\n\n6.  **Compare the Correct Statements (C and D):** We have established that both C and D are factually correct statements. In a single-choice question, we must find the *best* answer.\n    *   Statement D describes the fundamental chemistry and identifies the specific type of catalyst that is the key enabler for the process. This is a direct, actionable piece of scientific information relevant to a researcher in a lab.\n    *   Statement C describes the commercial status of the technology. While true and important, it's a statement about technological application rather than the underlying scientific principle.\n    *   In the context of a scientist seeking advice on how to perform a reaction, the statement identifying the correct class of catalyst (D) is the most direct and scientifically relevant piece of information. It addresses the \"how\" at a chemical level, which is the core of the scientist's challenge. Statement C confirms that the approach is viable at scale but doesn't provide the chemical starting point.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Statement A is false, and Statement B is misleading/irrelevant to the specific mechanism. Both C and D are factually correct. However, Statement D provides the fundamental chemical principle behind the technology and is the most direct and useful piece of advice for a scientist planning an experiment. Therefore, it is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
