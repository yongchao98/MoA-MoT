    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being identical means they are indistinguishable. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions.\n*   **Governing Principle:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number *n* (where *n* = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number *m_s*, which can be spin up (+1/2) or spin down (-1/2).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²).\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be written as E_n = n² * E.\n*   **State Occupancy:** According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, for each energy level *n*, there are two distinct quantum states (n, spin up) and (n, spin down). This means each energy level *n* can accommodate a maximum of two fermions.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_gs)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing the four fermions according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E_1 = 1²E = 1E):** We can place two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E_2 = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_gs = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_2)\nE_gs = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E)\nE_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n### 3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Promote one particle from n=2 to the next available level, which is n=3.\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy E_1 = 1E)\n    *   One particle in n=2 (Energy E_2 = 4E)\n    *   One particle in n=3 (Energy E_3 = 3²E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_3)\nE_1st = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state.\n\nLet's examine the possible configurations and their energies:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E_1) + (2 × E_2) + (1 × E_3)\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E_1) + (2 × E_3)\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E\n\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E_1) + (1 × E_2) + (1 × E_4)\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states:\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Next lowest energy: 18E\n*   Then: 20E, 22E, etc.\n\nThe second excited state is the one with energy 18E.\n\n### Summary of Energies\n\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
