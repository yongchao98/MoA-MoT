    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta (S') relative to the Galaxy (S) is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). To find this distance (`d`), we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**3. Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the time in the moving frame (`Δt'`) is given by the formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\nNow we can find the time `Δt` that corresponds to the 50 seconds that passed in the ejecta's frame.\n`Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\nFinally, calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame.\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n`d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or the provided Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s, time in the ejecta's frame (proper time)\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dilated time)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.1784789726\n>>>The calculation shows that the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n**7. Compare with the Options:**\n*   A) 3,000,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,060,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of ~3,061,862 km is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s. By the principle of relativity, this means the ejecta is also moving at `v = 60,000 km/s` relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀ or Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is called the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is a constant, approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Determine the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the **Galaxy's reference frame (S)**. The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`. Therefore, we need to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) that corresponds to the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\n**3. Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\nSpecial relativity tells us that time for a moving object (as measured by a stationary observer) passes more slowly than for the stationary observer. This is called time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame, `Δt'`) by the following equation:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor depends on the relative velocity `v` and the speed of light `c`. The formula is:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, substitute this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\nNow we can use the time dilation formula to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\nFinally, we can calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nUsing the calculation from the code interpreter:\n`d ≈ 3,061,862.18 km`\n\n**7. Compare with the Options:**\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Let's compare this to the given choices:\nA) 3,000,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe value `3,061,862.18 km` is closest to `3,060,000 km`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
