    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. A spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis) can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole with its dipole moment `p(t)` aligned along the z-axis.\n\n1.  **Radiation Pattern of an Oscillating Electric Dipole:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation. The problem states this power is a function `f(\\lambda, θ)`.\n\n2.  **Frequency and Wavelength Dependence:**\n    The radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω` (`P ∝ ω⁴`). The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`.\n    Combining these dependencies, the function `f` has the form:\n    `f(\\lambda, θ) = K * (1/λ⁴) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `K` is a proportionality constant.\n    From this, we can immediately see that a possible form of `f` involves `λ⁻⁴`. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n3.  **Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    The power radiated `f(\\lambda, θ)` is maximum when the `sin²(θ)` term is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, the maximum power `A` is:\n    `A = f(\\lambda, 90°) = K * (1/λ⁴) * sin²(90°) = K * (1/λ⁴) * 1 = K/λ⁴`\n\n4.  **Power Radiated at θ = 30°:**\n    Now, we calculate the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`:\n    `f(\\lambda, 30°) = K * (1/λ⁴) * sin²(30°)`\n\n5.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio `f(\\lambda, 30°) / A`:\n    Fraction = `[K * (1/λ⁴) * sin²(30°)] / [K / λ⁴]`\n    Fraction = `sin²(30°)`\n\n    To evaluate this, we use the value of `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Fraction = `(1/2)² = 1/4`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and a possible form for the function `f` is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n    This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
