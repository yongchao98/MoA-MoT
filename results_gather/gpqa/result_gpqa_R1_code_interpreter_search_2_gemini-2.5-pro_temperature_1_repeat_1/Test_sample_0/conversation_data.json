    "This problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that for a quantum state, the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) are related by the following inequality:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical purposes and estimations, this is often written as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nHere, ΔE represents the natural linewidth or the inherent uncertainty in the energy of the state, and Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:**\n\n    *   For the first state (State 1):\n        *   Lifetime, τ₁ = Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   For the second state (State 2):\n        *   Lifetime, τ₂ = Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels:**\n\n    For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguishable,\" the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (their linewidths). A common criterion is that the energy difference should be at least on the order of the larger of the two linewidths.\n\n    The total uncertainty can be considered the sum of the individual uncertainties:\n    ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    ΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    So, to clearly distinguish the levels, their energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n3.  **Compare this requirement with the given options:**\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV  (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (<< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV  (>> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV  (< 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option C provides an energy difference that is substantially larger than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states.

    "The problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical purposes, this is often approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. This ΔE is the minimum uncertainty in the energy, also known as the natural linewidth.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.**\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   Using the value of ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s, we get:\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels.**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their combined energy uncertainties. In other words, the separation between the energy peaks must be greater than the width of the peaks. A conservative criterion is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual linewidths.\n\n*   Minimum required energy difference ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   Minimum required energy difference ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Minimum required energy difference ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, for the levels to be distinguishable, their energy separation must be significantly greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the calculated requirement with the given options.**\nWe are looking for an energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that is much greater than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)**\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.
