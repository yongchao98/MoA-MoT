    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from Spectral Data**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm suggests these protons are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm suggests these protons are ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is likely a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine group (at 2.9 ppm).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H is a methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (directly attached to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the Structure:** The alkyl fragments are an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and an isopropyl-like fragment (-CH(CH₃)-). Putting them together based on the coupling, the benzylic carbon is the methine (-CH-), which is attached to both a methyl group and an ethyl group. This describes a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (B).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This reagent combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to the corresponding alkane. Specifically, it reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Transformation:**\n        *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   **Reaction:** The -COOH group on the benzene ring is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   **Final Product:** The sec-butyl group at position 4 is unaffected. The resulting molecule is a benzene ring with a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    The final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which corresponds to option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
