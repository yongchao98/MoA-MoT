    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics principle:** The problem deals with the decay of fast-moving particles. The key concept is that a moving particle's internal \"clock\" runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab frame). This phenomenon is called time dilation. Consequently, the particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab, allowing it to travel a greater distance before decaying.\n\n2.  **Formulate the particle decay equation:**\n    The number of particles, N, remaining from an initial population, N₀, after a time 't' is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / τ)\n    Here, 't' is the time elapsed in the particle's own rest frame (its proper time), and 'τ' is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (its lifetime when at rest).\n\n3.  **Relate lab frame measurements to the particle's rest frame:**\n    *   The particles are created at the center and travel to the detector wall, covering a distance R = 30 meters in the lab frame.\n    *   They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, so we can approximate their speed as v ≈ c (the speed of light).\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is $t_{lab} = R / v \\approx R / c$.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$) is related to the proper time elapsed in the particle's frame ($t_{proper}$) by the Lorentz factor, γ:\n        $t_{lab} = \\gamma * t_{proper}$\n    *   Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its flight is:\n        $t_{proper} = t_{lab} / \\gamma \\approx (R/c) / \\gamma$\n\n4.  **Combine the equations:**\n    Substitute the expression for proper time into the decay equation:\n    N/N₀ = e^(-t_proper / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ)\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    N/N₀ = e^(-R / (γ * cτ))\n    The term `cτ` represents the mean distance a particle would travel at the speed of light during its proper lifetime. It's a constant for a given type of particle.\n\n5.  **Analyze the two scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Fraction of surviving particles, N₁/N₀ = 1/3\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n        *   Radius, R = 30 m\n        Plugging these values into our equation:\n        1/3 = e^(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n        -ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\n        ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)  **(Equation A)**\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Fraction of surviving particles, N₂/N₀ = 2/3\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ? (This is what we need to find)\n        *   Radius, R = 30 m\n        Plugging these values into our equation:\n        2/3 = e^(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n        -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n        ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)  **(Equation B)**\n\n6.  **Solve for the unknown Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n    We have a system of two equations with two unknowns (γ₂ and the constant cτ). A convenient way to solve this is to take the ratio of the two equations to eliminate the `cτ` and `R` terms.\n    Divide Equation A by Equation B:\n    ln(3) / ln(3/2) = [1.5 / (cτ)] / [30 / (γ₂ * cτ)]\n    ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) * (γ₂ * cτ / 30)\n    ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 * γ₂) / 30\n    ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20\n    Now, isolate γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\n\n7.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    To get a numerical answer, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the required Lorentz factor, gamma_2\n# gamma_2 = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\ngamma_2 = 20 * (math.log(3) / math.log(3/2))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.18844893321597\n```\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. This is extremely close to the value given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after traveling a distance `R` is given by the formula:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n*   `R` is the distance traveled (the radius of the detector, 30 m).\n\nThe term `c*τ` is a constant for this type of particle.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Distance, `R = 30` m\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown `cτ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?` (This is what we need to find)\n*   Distance, `R = 30` m\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`  (Equation 2)\n\n**Solving for γ₂:**\nNow we can use the two equations to solve for `γ₂`. The most straightforward method is to divide Equation 1 by Equation 2 to eliminate the constant term `cτ`:\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) * (γ₂ * cτ / 30)`\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 * γ₂) / 30`\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nCalculating the value:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
