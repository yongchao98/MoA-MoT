    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a calculation to determine the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 + (N/2) - (H/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 + (1/2) - (11/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 + 0.5 - 5.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is consistent with a **conjugated ester** (Ar-COOR). An unconjugated ester would be at a higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), and a conjugated amide would typically be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) indicates it is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is significantly downfield, indicating the -CH₂- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**, specifically one attached to a carbonyl carbon (as in an ester), which explains the strong deshielding of the CH₂ protons.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those on an oxygen or nitrogen. Combined with the IR data, this signal is definitively from the **primary amine (-NH₂) protons**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets of equal integration suggest a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The ring has an electron-donating group (EDG) and an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The -NH₂ group is a strong EDG, and the ester group (-COOR) is an EWG.\n        *   The protons ortho to the EDG (-NH₂) are shielded and appear upfield (at **7.0 ppm**).\n        *   The protons ortho to the EWG (-COOR) are deshielded and appear downfield (at **8.0 ppm**).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound has the following pieces:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure matches all the data perfectly. It has a para-substituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ester linkage is different (Ar-O-CO-Et). The NMR would show a -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The IR for the unconjugated ester would be at a higher frequency.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a primary amide (-CONH₂), but the substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would produce a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. The IR for the amide carbonyl would be at a lower frequency.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH₂). The IR would only show one N-H band, and the NMR would show only one NH proton. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal at >8 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that fits all the spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
