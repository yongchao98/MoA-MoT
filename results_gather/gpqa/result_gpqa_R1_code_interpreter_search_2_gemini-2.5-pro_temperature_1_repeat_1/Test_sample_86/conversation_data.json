    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 8. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to the aromatic ring. This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon, carbonyl-containing group:\n        *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This fits perfectly: 2 carbons and one C=O group.\n        *   **2-oxoethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also fits: 2 carbons and one C=O group.\n        *   **Methoxycarbonyl group:** -C(=O)OCH₃. This also has 2 carbons and a C=O.\n        *   **Acetoxy group:** -OC(=O)CH₃. This also has 2 carbons and a C=O.\n\n3.  **Propose Candidate Structures and Predict their 1H NMR Spectra:**\n    The two substituents (-X and the carbonyl group) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. The NMR options provided show a simple, symmetric pattern for the aromatic protons (two doublets, each for 2H), which is highly characteristic of **para (1,4) substitution**. This simplifies our analysis.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: para-Haloacetophenone**\n        *   Structure: A halogen and an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) are in para positions on the benzene ring.\n        *   This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond. It meets all initial criteria.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 aromatic protons. Due to para substitution and the presence of two different groups, they will appear as two distinct signals. Each signal will be for 2 equivalent protons and will be a doublet due to splitting by its neighbor. So, we expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H, typically in the 7.0-8.0 ppm range.\n            *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl group and has no adjacent protons. It will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: para-Halo-2-phenylacetaldehyde**\n        *   Structure: A halogen and a -CH₂CHO group are in para positions.\n        *   This structure also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** Similar to candidate 1, we expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This proton is highly deshielded and appears as a signal around 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH₂- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)**. It integrates to **1H**.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** These protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They will appear as a **doublet (d)** around 3.5-4.0 ppm, integrating to **2H**.\n\n4.  **Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (> 6.5 ppm). Incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not 1. Incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This is a perfect match for the 4 aromatic protons on a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a perfect match for the 3 protons of a methyl ketone (-C(=O)CH₃).\n        *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option has the correct aromatic pattern for para substitution. The 9.9 ppm signal indicates an aldehyde. The 3.7 ppm signal could be a methylene group. This points towards Candidate 2 (para-Halo-2-phenylacetaldehyde).\n        *   **However, the multiplicities are wrong.** For this structure, the aldehyde proton (9.9 ppm) should be a triplet (split by CH₂), not a singlet. The methylene protons (3.7 ppm) should be a doublet (split by CHO), not a singlet. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only option that is fully consistent with all the provided information (carbon count, functional groups, and NMR principles) is C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
