    "This problem asks for the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical charges. The total potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies for every pair of charges in the system. To find the minimum energy, the charges must be arranged in a configuration that maximizes their mutual distances.\n\n**1. System Description:**\n*   There are 13 identical particles.\n*   The charge of each particle is `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`e ≈ 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`).\n*   One charge, let's call it `q_c`, is fixed at a central point P.\n*   The other 12 charges, `q_1, q_2, ..., q_12`, are constrained to be at a distance `R = 2 m` from point P, meaning they lie on the surface of a sphere of radius R.\n\n**2. Energy Calculation Breakdown:**\nThe total electrostatic potential energy `U_total` of the system can be divided into two components:\n*   **`U_interaction_center`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge `q_c` and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n*   **`U_interaction_sphere`**: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n`U_total = U_interaction_center + U_interaction_sphere`\n\n**3. Minimizing the Energy:**\n*   **`U_interaction_center`**: Each of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a fixed distance `R` from the central charge `q_c`. The energy for each pair is `k * q_c * q_i / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`). Since all charges are identical (`q_c = q_i = q = 2e`), this energy component is:\n    `U_interaction_center = 12 * (k * q² / R)`\n    This value is constant and does not depend on the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n*   **`U_interaction_sphere`**: This is the energy of the 12 charges interacting with each other on the sphere's surface. To minimize the total energy `U_total`, we must minimize this component. This is a classic problem in physics known as the **Thomson problem**. The charges will repel each other and settle into a configuration that maximizes their separation distances. For 12 charges on a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\n**4. Icosahedron Geometry and Energy:**\nAn icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces. To calculate `U_interaction_sphere`, we need the distances between all pairs of vertices.\nIn an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R`:\n*   From any vertex, there are 5 adjacent vertices at a distance `a` (the edge length of the icosahedron).\n*   There are 5 other vertices at a distance `a * φ`, where `φ` is the golden ratio (`φ = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618`).\n*   There is 1 antipodal vertex at a distance of `2R`.\n\nThe edge length `a` is related to the circumradius `R` by the formula:\n`a = 4R / sqrt(10 + 2√5)`\n\nThe energy `U_interaction_sphere` is the sum of energies of all pairs on the sphere. There are `(12 * 11) / 2 = 66` pairs in total.\n*   30 pairs are separated by distance `a` (the edges).\n*   30 pairs are separated by distance `aφ`.\n*   6 pairs are antipodal, separated by `2R`.\n\nSo, `U_interaction_sphere = k * q² * [ 30/a + 30/(aφ) + 6/(2R) ]`\n\n**5. Total Energy Calculation:**\n`U_total = U_interaction_center + U_interaction_sphere`\n`U_total = [12 * (k * q² / R)] + [k * q² * (30/a + 30/(aφ) + 3/R)]`\n`U_total = k * q² * [12/R + 30/a + 30/(aφ) + 3/R]`\n`U_total = k * q² * [15/R + (30/a) * (1 + 1/φ)]`\nSince `1 + 1/φ = φ`,\n`U_total = k * q² * [15/R + 30φ/a]`\n\nSubstituting `a = 4R / sqrt(10 + 2√5)`:\n`U_total = k * q² * [15/R + (30φ / (4R / sqrt(10 + 2√5)))]`\n`U_total = (k * q² / R) * [15 + (30φ/4) * sqrt(10 + 2√5)]`\n`U_total = (k * (2e)² / R) * [15 + 7.5φ * sqrt(10 + 2√5)]`\n\nWe can now compute this value using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nk = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb's constant in N·m²/C²\ne = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in C\nR = 2.0  # Radius of the sphere in meters\n\n# Calculate the charge q\nq = 2 * e\n\n# Calculate the golden ratio\nphi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n\n# Calculate the squared term that appears in the energy formula\nkq2_over_R = k * q**2 / R\n\n# Calculate the geometric factor for the 12 charges on the sphere\n# This involves the distances between vertices of an icosahedron.\n# Total pairs = 66.\n# Number of edges (distance a) = 30\n# Number of antipodal pairs (distance 2R) = 6\n# Number of pairs with distance a*phi = 30\na = (4 * R) / math.sqrt(10 + 2 * math.sqrt(5))\nU_sphere_sphere = k * q**2 * (30/a + 30/(a*phi) + 6/(2*R))\n\n# Calculate the interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 on the sphere\nU_center_sphere = 12 * kq2_over_R\n\n# The total minimum energy is the sum of the two components\nU_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{U_total:.3e}\")\n```\n2.822e-26\n\nThe calculation yields a total minimum energy of approximately 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ Joules.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶\nB) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷\nC) 122.330\nD) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
