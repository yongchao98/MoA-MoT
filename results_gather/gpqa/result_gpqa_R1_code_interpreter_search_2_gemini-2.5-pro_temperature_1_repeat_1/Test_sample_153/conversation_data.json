    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak (M+2) at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to the 3:1 natural abundance ratio of the chlorine isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl. This is strong evidence that the molecule contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl, ¹⁶O) would be: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 g/mol. This matches the M+2 peak. All four options have this molecular formula.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This rules out option A (phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and option C (an aldehyde and a phenol).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO*O*H). The signal is a singlet as this proton does not typically couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton. This confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution results in only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would result in a more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom at opposite ends of the ring. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the spectral data:\n        *   Correct molecular weight (156) and chlorine isotope pattern.\n        *   IR peaks for a carboxylic acid.\n        *   ¹H NMR signals for a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted aromatic ring. The electron-withdrawing carboxyl group deshields the adjacent protons, causing them to appear more downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:** All evidence points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
