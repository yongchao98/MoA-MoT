    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   The star's temperature (T_star) and radius (R_star) are the same for both planets, so they cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2), so the (1 - A)^(1/4) term cancels out.\n    *   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n    *   This leaves us with a simplified ratio:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observable Quantities:** We need to find the ratio a2 / a1. The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method.\n    *   The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K, the RV amplitude) by: K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit with mass m_p, orbiting a star of mass M_star, the induced RV amplitude K of the star is given by:\n        K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n        (This assumes m_p << M_star and an edge-on orbit with inclination i ≈ 90°, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were also detected by the transit method).\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula for K to solve for `a`:\n    *   K² ≈ (m_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    *   K² ≈ (G * m_p²) / (M_star * a)\n    *   a ≈ (G * m_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio a2 / a1:** Now we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (G * m_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * m_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n    *   The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out.\n    *   a2 / a1 = (m_p2² / K2²) / (m_p1² / K1²) = (m_p2 / m_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n8.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (m_p2 / m_p1):**\n        m_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        m_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        m_p2 / m_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):**\n        Since K is directly proportional to Δλ (K = c * Δλ/λ₀), the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n9.  **Substitute into the a2 / a1 Ratio:**\n    *   a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    *   a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    *   a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    *   15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Planet 1 mass in Earth masses\nmp1 = 7\n# Planet 1 Doppler shift in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n\n# Planet 2 mass in Earth masses\nmp2 = 5\n# Planet 2 Doppler shift in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to sqrt(a2 / a1),\n# where 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n# The semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to (m_p / K)^2, where m_p is the planet mass\n# and K is the radial velocity amplitude.\n# K is proportional to delta_lambda.\n# So, a is proportional to (m_p / delta_lambda)^2.\n# Therefore, a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / delta_lambda2)^2 / (m_p1 / delta_lambda1)^2\n# a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)^2\n\n# Ratio of masses (m_p2 / m_p1)\nmass_ratio = mp2 / mp1\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Ratio of semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (shift_ratio**2)\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (sqrt(a2/a1))\nTeq_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(f\"{Teq_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{eq}$) is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, which is $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince the star is the same for both planets ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant) and the problem states they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), these terms cancel out. The equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. We can determine this from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n\n$K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_{star} + m_p)}$), we can derive a more direct relationship between K, mass, and semi-major axis. For $m_p \\ll M_{star}$:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n\nSince the planets were detected via the transit method, we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{m_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n$a \\approx \\frac{m_p^2 G}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{m_{p2}^2 G}{K_2^2 M_{star}}}{\\frac{m_{p1}^2 G}{K_1^2 M_{star}}}$\n\nThe gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{m_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{m_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{m_{p2}}{m_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$), so the ratio $\\frac{K_1}{K_2}$ is equal to the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nWe are given:\n*   $m_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $m_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
