    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**: This immediately suggests isotopic labeling, a common practice in chemistry to study reaction mechanisms. A very common example is using Deuterium (D or ²H), the heavier isotope of Hydrogen (H or ¹H). So, Substance X likely contains Deuterium.\n\n    *   **\"...reacts violently with liquid Y...\"**: This points to a highly reactive substance. Many hydrides and their deuterated analogs react violently with protic solvents like water.\n\n    *   **\"...with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**: Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (p = n). This is a strong candidate.\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n).\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): Each ¹⁴N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So, ¹⁴N₂ has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n        *   ¹⁶O₂ (Oxygen): Each ¹⁶O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So, ¹⁶O₂ has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n        *   Given the first clue about a heavier isotope, D₂ is the most plausible identity for gas W.\n\n    *   **\"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**:\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is \"very close to 277 K\". This is a perfect match.\n        *   So, B must be D₂O.\n        *   If heating precipitate G releases D₂O, then G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, M(OD)n. This hydroxide forms from the reaction of X with a liquid Y.\n        *   For the reaction to produce D₂ gas and a deuterated hydroxide precipitate G, the liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O). The violent reaction would be: `X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`.\n        *   This confirms our hypothesis: Y is D₂O, W is D₂, B is D₂O.\n\n    *   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**:\n        *   A keto acid has the general formula R-CO-COOH, containing a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   The fact that X reacts with it suggests X is a reagent used in organic synthesis. The reduction in the number of oxygen atoms implies X is a reducing agent.\n        *   The most common and powerful hydride reducing agents are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n        *   LiAlH₄ is a very strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones (to secondary alcohols, -CH(OH)-) and carboxylic acids (to primary alcohols, -CH₂OH).\n        *   Reaction: `R-CO-COOH (3 Oxygens) + LiAlH₄ → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (2 Oxygens)`. This matches the clue perfectly.\n        *   NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent and typically does not reduce carboxylic acids. So, the product would still have 3 oxygens. This rules out NaBD₄.\n        *   Therefore, substance X is the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, which is **LiAlD₄** (Lithium aluminum deuteride).\n\n    *   **\"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**: This confirms our identification. LiAlH₄ is an extremely common and important reagent. Its deuterated version, LiAlD₄, is used for mechanistic studies.\n\n    *   **Final check of the full reaction sequence**:\n        *   X = LiAlD₄\n        *   Y = D₂O\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → 4D₂ (gas W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G)`\n        *   Heating G: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (substance B)`\n        *   All clues are satisfied. Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n\n    *   The question specifies: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element found in one formula unit of LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation (mass number = protons + neutrons).\n\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):**\n        *   There are 4 atoms of Hydrogen in the formula.\n        *   They are present as the heavier isotope, Deuterium (D or ²H).\n        *   The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):**\n        *   There is 1 atom of Aluminum in the formula.\n        *   The stable isotope is ²⁷Al.\n        *   The mass number of Aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nI will use a simple python script to confirm the arithmetic.\n```python\n# Atomic mass numbers for the relevant isotopes\nmass_deuterium = 2  # Isotope D (²H) of the lightest element, Hydrogen\nmass_aluminum = 27 # Isotope ²⁷Al of the heaviest element, Aluminum\n\n# Number of atoms in the formula LiAlD₄\nnum_deuterium_atoms = 4\nnum_aluminum_atoms = 1\n\n# Calculate the contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium)\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_deuterium_atoms * mass_deuterium\n\n# Calculate the contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum)\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_aluminum_atoms * mass_aluminum\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<execute_output>\n35\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation confirms the result is 35.

    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry puzzle to identify a substance (X) and then perform a calculation based on its composition.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X from the clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\" This strongly suggests the use of a heavy isotope for labeling, most commonly Deuterium (D or ²H), the heavy isotope of Hydrogen. So, X contains Deuterium.\n    *   **Clue 2:** \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"\n        *   Let's analyze potential gases (W) with equal numbers of protons (p) and neutrons (n).\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1p and 1n. The molecule D₂ has 2p and 2n. This fits perfectly.\n        *   The violent reaction suggests X is a powerful reagent, and its reaction with a protic substance (like water) produces gas. If X is a deuteride (containing D⁻), and Y is a source of D⁺ (like D₂O), the reaction `D⁻ + D⁺ → D₂` would occur.\n    *   **Clue 3:** \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   277 K is approximately 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match. So, B is D₂O.\n        *   If Y is D₂O and it reacts with X to form a precipitate G, G is likely a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n. This is consistent with the reaction of a metal deuteride with heavy water.\n    *   **Clue 4:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a general structure like R-CO-COOH, containing a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. It has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   The reaction with X reduces the oxygen count to 2. This means X is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. The product would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   The most famous strong reducing agent in organic chemistry that performs this transformation is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   **Clue 5:** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This confirms our identification. LiAlH₄ is a workhorse reagent, and its deuterated analog is used for mechanistic studies.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining all clues, Substance X must be the deuterated version of LiAlH₄. Therefore, **X = LiAlD₄** (Lithium aluminum deuteride).\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". We should use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (in the form of Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The question states, \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we need to sum the masses of all the hydrogen atoms and all the aluminum atoms in the formula unit.\n\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):**\n        *   There are 4 atoms of hydrogen in the formula, all as the heavier isotope Deuterium (D or ²H).\n        *   The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 atoms × 2 = 8.\n\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):**\n        *   There is 1 atom of Aluminum in the formula.\n        *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al.\n        *   The mass number of Aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 atom × 27 = 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches the output from the Python code.\n\nThe final answer is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
