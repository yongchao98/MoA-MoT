    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The substituent already present on the ring determines two things:\n1.  **Reactivity:** Whether the ring reacts faster (activating group) or slower (deactivating group) than benzene itself.\n2.  **Orientation:** Where the incoming bromine atom will attach. Substituents are either *ortho, para*-directors or *meta*-directors.\n\nThe question asks to order the substances by the increasing yield of the *para*-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect. This will be the most important factor in determining the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yield of the ortho and para isomers is very low.\n    *   `-NO2` (Nitro group in substance 4) is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid group in substance 6) is deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   `-COOC2H5` (Ester group in substance 2) is deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substances 2, 4, and 6 will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will be at the beginning of our sequence.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   `-CH3` (Methyl group in substance 1) is activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   `-C2H5` (Ethyl group in substance 5) is activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   `-Cl` (Chloro group in substance 3) is deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substances 1, 3, and 5 will have the highest para-isomer yields and will be at the end of our sequence.\n\nThis initial classification tells us the final order will be of the form: {2, 4, 6} < {1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\nWe need to arrange substances 2, 4, and 6 in order of increasing para-yield. For meta-directors, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. Generally, a stronger deactivating group will lead to higher meta-selectivity and thus an even lower para-yield.\n\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n    *   `C6H5-NO2` (4): Has the strongest deactivating group, giving the lowest para-yield (typically ~1%).\n    *   `C6H5-COOH` (6): The next strongest deactivator, giving a very low para-yield (typically <2%).\n    *   `C6H5-COOC2H5` (2): The least deactivating of the three, giving a slightly higher (but still low) para-yield (typically ~3%).\n*   The order of increasing para-yield is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\nWe need to arrange substances 1, 3, and 5. For these, the yield of the para-isomer is high, and the ratio of para to ortho product is determined by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions, making substitution at the less hindered para position more favorable.\n    *   The size of the alkyl groups is: `-C2H5` > `-CH3`.\n    *   Therefore, the steric hindrance is greater for the ethyl group, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, Para%(5) > Para%(1).\n    *   *Typical values:* Bromination of toluene (1) gives ~67% para-isomer. Bromination of ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage due to increased steric bulk.\n\n*   **Electronic and Steric Effects for Halogens:** The chloro group (-Cl) in substance 3 is a special case.\n    *   It is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is strongest at the ortho position, making it less reactive than the para position.\n    *   This electronic deactivation of the ortho position, combined with some steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer.\n    *   *Typical value:* Bromination of chlorobenzene (3) gives ~89% para-isomer.\n\n*   **Comparing 1, 3, and 5:**\n    *   Para yield for Toluene (1) is ~67%.\n    *   Para yield for Ethylbenzene (5) is >67% (due to more steric bulk).\n    *   Para yield for Chlorobenzene (3) is ~89% (due to electronic effects favoring para).\n*   The order of increasing para-yield is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the sequences**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the final sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   Low para-yield group: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   High para-yield group: `1 < 5 < 3`\n*   **Overall order:** `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
