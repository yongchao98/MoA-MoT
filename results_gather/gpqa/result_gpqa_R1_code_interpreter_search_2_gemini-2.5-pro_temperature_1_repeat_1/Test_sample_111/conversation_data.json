    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Define the initial state and normalize it.**\n\nThe electron state `|alpha>` is given as proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|alpha'>`.\n`|alpha'> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`\n\nIn the standard basis where `|up>` is `[1, 0]` and `|down>` is `[0, 1]`, the vector representation is:\n`|alpha'>  ->  [1+i, 2-i]`\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to calculate its norm squared, `<alpha'|alpha'>`.\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2`\n`|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2`\n`|2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5`\n`<alpha'|alpha'> = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe norm is `sqrt(7)`. The normalization constant is `N = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nSo, the normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\n**2. Define the operator A.**\n\nThe matrix representation of the operator `A` is given by its elements `Aij`. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis (a 2x2 matrix):\n*   `Aij = 0` if `i = j` (diagonal elements are zero).\n*   `Aij = hbar/2` if `i != j` (off-diagonal elements are `hbar/2`).\n\nSo, the matrix for `A` is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix (`sigma_x`).\n\n**3. Find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A.**\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation `A|v> = lambda|v>`. This is equivalent to finding the roots of the characteristic equation `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`.\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -lambda ]]) = 0`\n`(-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`lambda = +/- hbar/2`\n\nThe two eigenvalues are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates (eigenvectors).\n\nFor `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n`(A - lambda_1*I)|v1> = 0`\n`[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = [[0], [0]]`\nThis gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`.\nNormalizing it: `(1/sqrt(1^2+1^2)) * [1, 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`.\nSo, `|v1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\nFor `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n`(A - lambda_2*I)|v2> = 0`\n`[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = [[0], [0]]`\nThis gives the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`.\nNormalizing it: `(1/sqrt(1^2+(-1)^2)) * [1, -1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`.\nSo, `|v2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the probabilities of measurement.**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenstate.\n\nProbability `P1` (for `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`) = `|<v1|alpha>|^2`.\n`c1 = <v1|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n`c1 = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`c1 = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1 + i + 2 - i ] = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n`P1 = |c1|^2 = (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14`\n`P1 ≈ 0.6428`\n\nProbability `P2` (for `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`) = `|<v2|alpha>|^2`.\n`c2 = <v2|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n`c2 = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i) ]`\n`c2 = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ 1 + i - 2 + i ] = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)`\n`P2 = |c2|^2 = (|-1 + 2i|^2) / 14 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14`\n`P2 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**5. Calculate the average value of the operator A.**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\nMethod 1: Sum of eigenvalues weighted by their probabilities.\n`<A> = P1*lambda_1 + P2*lambda_2`\n`<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar/7`\n\nMethod 2: Using the formula `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`.\n`<alpha| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i]`\n`A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`<A> = <alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [ 2 ] = 2*hbar/14 = hbar/7`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are **0.64** (for eigenvalue +hbar/2) and **0.36** (for eigenvalue -hbar/2).\n*   The average value of the operator A is **hbar/7**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)\nB) 0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)\nC) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7\nD) 0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
