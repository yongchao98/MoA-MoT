    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a position x is given by the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\n    The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.\n    This is a complex number of the form `Re + i*Im`, where `Re = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and `Im = -0.5`.\n    The square of the modulus is |ψ(x)|² = (Re)² + (Im)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n2.  **Normalization Condition:** For the particle to exist, the total probability of finding it in the allowed region must be 1. We are told the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density from 1 to 3, and the result must be 1.\n    ∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    ∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\n3.  **Integration:** We solve the definite integral.\n    ∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n    *   The first part: a² * [ln(1 + x)] evaluated from 1 to 3\n        = a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n        = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\n        = a² * ln(4/2)\n        = a² * ln(2)\n    *   The second part: [0.25x] evaluated from 1 to 3\n        = 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1\n        = 0.75 - 0.25\n        = 0.5\n\n4.  **Solve for 'a':** Now we substitute the results of the integration back into the equation.\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:** Using the provided code output, we know that:\n    a ≈ 0.8493\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value a ≈ 0.8493 is closest to the given option A) 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
