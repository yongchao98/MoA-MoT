    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Due to its C₂v symmetry, the two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Their chemical shift is ~7.0-7.3 ppm. This matches the data.\n    *   Also due to symmetry, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent sp² carbons of the double bond (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This leads to two peaks in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. The C=C carbons resonate around 135-140 ppm, and the anhydride carbonyls resonate around 165 ppm. This also matches the data.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula of the product.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄): The cyclopentadiene ring has 5 carbons. Four of them have a methyl group. The C5 carbon is a CH₂. So, C₅H₂(ring) + 4×CH₃ = C₉H₁₄.\n    *   Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n    *   Product = C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n*   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride.\n*   This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   Like many Diels-Alder reactions, this reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* isomers. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers.\n*   According to the **Alder endo rule**, for reactions involving a cyclic diene, the *endo* product is typically the major product under kinetic control. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the π-system of the dienophile's substituents (the carbonyl groups in this case). The *exo* product is sterically less hindered and is the thermodynamically favored product. In the absence of information about reaction conditions (like high temperature), it is standard to assume the reaction is under kinetic control and the **major product is the *endo* isomer**.\n\n**Step 3: Visualize the structures of the *endo* and *exo* products.**\n*   Let's draw the bicyclic framework. The diene's C1 and C4 become the bridgehead carbons. The diene's C2 and C3 form a new double bond. The diene's C5 becomes the C7 methylene (CH₂) bridge. The maleic anhydride forms a fused five-membered anhydride ring.\n*   **Endo Product:** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond bridge.\n*   **Exo Product:** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond bridge.\n\n**Step 4: Use 2D NOESY NMR to distinguish between the isomers.**\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the major isomer but far apart in the minor isomer.\n*   Based on our assumption (Major = *endo*, Minor = *exo*), we need to find protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\nLet's analyze the key proton proximities in each isomer:\n*   **In the *endo* isomer:** The protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them **H_A**) are located under the C(Me)=C(Me) bridge. This brings them very close to the vinylic methyl groups (**Me_v**). A strong NOE cross-peak between **H_A** and **Me_v** is expected.\n*   **In the *exo* isomer:** The anhydride ring and its protons (**H_A**) are pointing away from the C(Me)=C(Me) bridge. The distance between **H_A** and the vinylic methyl groups (**Me_v**) is large, so no significant NOE is expected. However, in the *exo* isomer, the **H_A** protons are brought close to the protons of the C7 methylene bridge.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product is the one connecting **H_A** and **Me_v**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign the NMR signals from the options.**\nWe need to identify the signals corresponding to **H_A** and **Me_v**.\n*   **H_A**: These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. They will be deshielded. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Me_v**: These are the four methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent in two pairs, but often appear as a single peak. The problem describes them as two 6H singlets. The vinylic methyls are attached to sp² carbons and should appear downfield compared to saturated methyls. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is a typical chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups.\n*   The other signals mentioned are:\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This would correspond to the bridgehead methyl groups (**Me_b**), which are on saturated sp³ carbons and are more shielded.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This corresponds to one of the two inequivalent C7 bridge protons, which split each other into an AB quartet (appearing as two doublets).\n\nThe NOE cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product is between **H_A** and **Me_v**. This corresponds to the correlation between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This would be C7-H and H_A, characteristic of the *exo* isomer).\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (This is Me_b and C7-H).\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This is Me_v and H_A, characteristic of the *endo* isomer).\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (This is Me_b and Me_v, expected in both isomers).\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
