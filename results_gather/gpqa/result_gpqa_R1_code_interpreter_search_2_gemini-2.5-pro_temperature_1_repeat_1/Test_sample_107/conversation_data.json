    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman effect, describes the interaction energy of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The question specifies the interaction involving the orbital magnetic quantum number *m*, so we are interested in the coupling of the orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ with the external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is related to the electron's orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\nwhere *e* is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nThis can be expressed using the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the Hamiltonian expression:\n$H = - \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so we can write $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = (L_x\\hat{x} + L_y\\hat{y} + L_z\\hat{z}) \\cdot (B\\hat{z}) = L_z B$\n\nSo the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$H = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} L_z$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where *m* is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\nTherefore, the energy shift is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) = m \\mu_B B$\n\n### **2. Calculate the Magnitude of the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Magnetic field, $B = 1$ T.\n*   A small value for the orbital magnetic quantum number *m*. We can choose $m=1$ as a representative small, non-zero integer value.\n\nWe need the value of the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$:\n*   $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n*   In more convenient units for atomic physics, $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is approximately $10^{-5}$ eV.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe problem specifies a transition in the Hydrogen atom that emits or absorbs light with a wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu m$.\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength to nanometers (nm):\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu m = 486.1 \\, nm$\n\nThis wavelength corresponds to the Balmer-beta transition (n=4 to n=2) in the hydrogen spectrum.\n\nThe energy of a photon ($\\Delta E$) with a given wavelength ($\\lambda$) is calculated using the formula:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere *h* is Planck's constant and *c* is the speed of light.\n\nA very useful formula for a quick calculation is:\n$\\Delta E (\\text{in eV}) \\approx \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{in nm})}$\n\nUsing this formula, we can find the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the transition energy is approximately 1 eV.\n\n### **4. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's look at their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is a very small number, much less than 1. This means that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of an electronic transition in the visible spectrum.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option B. To be certain, let's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Define constants\n# Bohr magneton in eV/T\nmu_B_eV = 5.7883818012e-5\n# Wavelength in meters\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6\n# Product of h (in eV.s) and c (in m/s)\nhc_eVm = 4.135667696e-15 * const.c\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm_l = 1  # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy in eV\nH_coupling_eV = m_l * mu_B_eV * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy in eV\nDelta_E_eV = hc_eVm / lambda_m\n\n# 3. Print the results for comparison\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_coupling_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {Delta_E_eV:.3f} eV\")\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta E = {H_coupling_eV / Delta_E_eV:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H> = 5.788e-05 eV\nTransition energy Delta E = 2.551 eV\nRatio <H> / Delta E = 2.269e-05\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the paramagnetic coupling energy is approximately $5.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV, while the transition energy is about 2.55 eV. The ratio is approximately $2.3 \\times 10^{-5}$, which is significantly less than 1.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The paramagnetic coupling energy is much smaller than the transition energy.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate and compare the magnitudes of two distinct energies:\n1.  The paramagnetic coupling energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, which represents the energy of an atom's orbital magnetic moment in an external magnetic field.\n2.  The transition energy, $\\Delta E$, of a photon with a specific wavelength.\n\n### **1. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of an electron's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ (the paramagnetic coupling term, or Zeeman effect) is given by:\n$H = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton ($\\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/T).\n- $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n- $\\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum operator.\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction energy becomes:\n$E = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy shift is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}(m\\hbar)B = m\\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n- Magnetic field, $B = 1$ T.\n- A \"small value\" for $m$. Let's take $m=1$ as a representative small, non-zero integer.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\frac{\\text{eV}}{\\text{T}}) \\times (1 \\text{ T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### **2. Calculating the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the formula:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n- $h$ is Planck's constant.\n- $c$ is the speed of light.\n- A useful constant product is $hc \\approx 1240$ eVÂ·nm.\n\nWe are given the wavelength:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu m = 486.1$ nm\n\nNow, we calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55$ eV\n\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer-beta transition in the hydrogen atom, from the n=4 to the n=2 energy level).\n\n### **3. Comparing the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n- Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV\n- Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55$ eV\n\nIt is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy:\n$5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} \\ll 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nTherefore, the relationship between them is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis shows that the energy splitting caused by a reasonably strong laboratory magnetic field is a very small perturbation compared to the energy differences between principal electronic energy levels in an atom.\n\n<<<B>>>"
