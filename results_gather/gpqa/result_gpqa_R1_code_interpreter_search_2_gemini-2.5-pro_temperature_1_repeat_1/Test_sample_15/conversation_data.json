    "To determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to check if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters, but the molecule as a whole must not have any elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Molecules that have stereocenters but are achiral due to internal symmetry are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond, giving rise to Z/E isomerism, but it does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the C=C double bond and the atoms attached to it).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   The stereodescriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate specific absolute configurations at two stereocenters. This means we are considering a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   The parent structure (without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group) is symmetric. However, the `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` group (`=CHCl`) is an asymmetric substituent.\n    *   This substituent breaks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion that the parent molecule might have had.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R,3R), (2S,3S), and the (2R,3S) pair.\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer has opposite configurations at its two stereocenters.\n    *   If we draw this molecule in its staggered conformation, it possesses a center of inversion (i). If we draw it in an eclipsed conformation, it has an internal plane of symmetry (σ) that lies between C2 and C3.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral. This specific isomer is a **meso compound**.\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   It has the same configuration (R) at both stereocenters.\n    *   This molecule does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. (2R,3R) and (2S,S) form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   Let's check C1 for chirality. It is bonded to four groups: -H, -OH, -C2H2-C3H=, and -C6H2-C5H2-.\n    *   The two paths around the ring from C1 are different (-CH2-CH= vs -CH2-CH2-). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Regardless of whether the three -OH groups are all cis or one is trans relative to the other two, the molecule will have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   For example, in the all-cis isomer (all OH groups pointing up), a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond (e.g., C1 and C4) will reflect the other two C-OH groups onto each other.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true stereocenters (they are prochiral).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The name describes a ketone. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which implies a 4-carbon chain with the carbonyl group at C1. The numbering starts from the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This can also be written as `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers.\n    *   The carbon atom in the `CH(CH3)2` group (C3 of the butanoyl chain) is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active (chiral):\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically inactive (achiral):\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
