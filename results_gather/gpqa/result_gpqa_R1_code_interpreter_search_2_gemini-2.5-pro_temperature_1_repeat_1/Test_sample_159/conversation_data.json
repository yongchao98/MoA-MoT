    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach a circle as the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large. The apothem 'a' of the polygon will become the radius of this limiting circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction) of a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n1.  **Diffraction by a Circular Aperture (Airy Pattern):**\n    The intensity distribution in the far-field for a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The angular positions (θ) of the dark fringes (minima) are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is:\n    \n    sin(θ) = (xₘ / (k * a))\n    \n    where:\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n    *   xₘ is the m-th root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x), where m = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n2.  **Applying the Small Angle Approximation:**\n    The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for minima becomes:\n    \n    θₘ ≈ xₘ / (k * a)\n    \n    Substituting k = 2π / λ, we get:\n    \n    θₘ ≈ xₘ / ((2π / λ) * a) = (xₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n\n3.  **Finding the Zeros of the Bessel Function:**\n    We need the first two positive zeros of the J₁(x) function to find the positions of the first two minima. These values are well-known:\n    *   First zero (for the first minimum, m=1): x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero (for the second minimum, m=2): x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n4.  **Calculating the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   **First Minimum (θ₁):**\n        θ₁ ≈ (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n        θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n        θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n    \n    *   **Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n        θ₂ ≈ (x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n        θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n        θ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angular Distance:**\n    The angular distance between the first two minima is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    \n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\n    To get a more precise value, we can use a computational tool.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.special as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Find the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order 1 (J1)\n# The function sp.jn_zeros(n, nt) returns the first 'nt' positive zeros of the Bessel function Jn(x).\nzeros = sp.jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = zeros[0]  # First zero\nx2 = zeros[1]  # Second zero\n\n# The angular position of the m-th minimum is given by theta_m = (x_m / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# The coefficient for the angular position is x_m / (2*pi)\n\n# Coefficient for the first minimum\ncoeff1 = x1 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Coefficient for the second minimum\ncoeff2 = x2 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# The angular distance between them is (coeff2 - coeff1) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient (coeff2 - coeff1)\ndistance_coeff = coeff2 - coeff1\n\nprint(f\"{distance_coeff=}\")\n```\n>>>\ndistance_coeff=0.5067867207908852\n>>>\n\nThe calculation shows that the coefficient for the angular distance is approximately 0.5068.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.610 λ / a (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum, θ₁)\nC) 0.506 λ / a (This matches our calculated angular distance)\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe correct answer is the one that most closely matches our calculated value.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N tends to infinity. The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThis is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. The intensity distribution in the far-field for a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The angular positions (θ) of the dark fringes (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for intensity minima is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ) = xₘ`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n*   `θ` is the angle of diffraction.\n*   `xₘ` is the m-th root (zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`, for `m = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. So the equation becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = xₘ`\n\nRearranging for the angular position of the m-th minimum, `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (xₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the positions of the first (`m=1`) and second (`m=2`) minima. This requires the first two zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. These are well-known values:\n*   First zero, `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we calculate the angular positions for the first two minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`):\n    `θ₁ = (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`):\n    `θ₂ = (x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nLet's examine the provided options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the approximate position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value `0.5068 * (λ / a)` matches option C almost perfectly. The small difference is due to rounding of the Bessel function zeros. The more precise calculation provided by the code confirms this result (`0.5067...`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
