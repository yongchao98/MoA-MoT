    "An analysis of the spectroscopic data is required to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR: Ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR signals:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons. Two signals suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly `para` (1,4-substitution), where the four protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs. This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d).\n        *   This group contains one -CH=, one =CH-, and one -CH3. It accounts for **2 vinyl hydrogens** and one methyl group.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** One methyl group is from the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3) as identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality. Since there are no -CH2- signals, this methyl must be directly attached to the ester, as in a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). Both possibilities contribute **6 hydrogens** (3H + 3H) from two methyl groups.\n    *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out many possibilities, such as ethyl esters, propyl groups, etc.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify all the fragments of the molecule:\n\n*   Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n*   Propenyl group: **C3H5** (-CH=CH-CH3)\n*   An ester group containing the second methyl group. There are two possibilities for how it's attached to the C6H4 ring:\n    *   Case A: A methyl ester group, -COOCH3. This fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n    *   Case B: An acetoxy group, -OCOCH3. This fragment is also **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Chemical Formula:**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the fragments. Since both possible ester arrangements have the same atomic count, the final formula will be the same regardless.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Compare with Options:**\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOur derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n**5. Verification (Degree of Unsaturation):**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nLet's check if this matches our proposed structure:\n*   Benzene ring: 4 (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n*   C=C double bond in the propenyl group: 1\n*   C=O double bond in the ester group: 1\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\nThe calculated DoU matches the structural features, confirming that C11H12O2 is the correct formula.\n\n<<<C>>>"
