    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup.**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage, mimicking a natural route of infection for gut pathogens.\n    *   **Observations before the key finding:** The passage notes some antigen is lost in the stomach and mucus. This is a distractor, indicating the delivery is not 100% efficient but is successful enough to elicit a response.\n    *   **Location of Immune Response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut (part of GALT - Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue). This is where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated. The fluorescence indicates the antigen has reached its target location.\n    *   **Responding Cells:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ, upon antigen encounter, specific lymphocytes (B and T cells) that recognize the antigen will rapidly divide (proliferate) in a process called clonal selection.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" is sequenced. This gene codes for the part of an antibody (or B cell receptor) that binds to the antigen.\n    *   **Key Finding:** \"High variability\" is observed in the sequences of this gene among the proliferating cells.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the immunological processes listed in the options.**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system (and can be activated by the adaptive system). It involves a cascade of proteins that help clear pathogens. It does not involve changes to the genes of lymphocytes.\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the genetic process that creates the initial, vast diversity of B cell receptors and T cell receptors. This process occurs in *developing* lymphocytes (pro- and pre-B cells) within the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) *before* they ever encounter an antigen. The experiment is looking at mature, proliferating lymphocytes in a *secondary* lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells that are proliferating in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). The process intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Cells whose mutations lead to higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and proliferate further (affinity maturation). This process perfectly matches the observation of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a Peyer's patch.\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the variable region. This switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA) to change the antibody's effector function, but it does not alter its antigen-binding specificity. The question explicitly states the variability is in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude by matching the observation to the process.**\n    The experiment describes the events within a germinal center reaction in a Peyer's patch following antigen stimulation. The generation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells is the definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
