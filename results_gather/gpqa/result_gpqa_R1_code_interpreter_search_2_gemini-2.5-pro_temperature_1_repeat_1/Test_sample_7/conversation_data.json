As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Data**\n\nFirst, let's examine the effect of knocking out each gene individually. The resistance levels are compared to a wild-type (WT) control, which has 100% resistance.\n\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of gene G1 causes a 25% reduction in resistance. This indicates that G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype, but it is not the most critical gene of the three.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of gene G2 completely eliminates resistance. This is a very strong effect, suggesting that G2 plays an essential, non-redundant role in the resistance pathway. A complete loss of function like this often points to a gene at the top of a regulatory cascade.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of gene G3 causes a 50% reduction in resistance. This means G3 has a more significant contribution to resistance than G1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Data to Determine Epistasis**\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene mutation masks the effect of another. To identify epistasis, we compare the phenotype of the double mutant to the phenotypes of the single mutants. The gene whose single-mutant phenotype is observed in the double mutant is considered \"epistatic\" to the other gene. This usually implies the epistatic gene acts upstream in the same pathway.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The double mutant has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n*   **g2g3 mutant (0% resistance):** The double mutant has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g3` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\nFrom these two points, we can conclude that G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3. Since the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, **G2 is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor**. It appears to be a master switch that is required to activate the resistance pathway involving G1 and G3.\n\n**3. Analyze the `g1g3` Double-Mutant Interaction**\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant (10% resistance):** The phenotype of this double mutant is novel; it's not the same as `g1` (75%) or `g3` (50%). In fact, it's much more severe than either single mutant.\n    *   Loss from g1 alone: 25%\n    *   Loss from g3 alone: 50%\n    *   If the genes were in completely separate, independent pathways, the expected loss would be additive: 25% + 50% = 75% loss, leading to 25% remaining resistance.\n    *   The observed resistance is 10%, which is a 90% loss. This greater-than-additive effect is known as a synergistic interaction. This synergy strongly suggests that G1 and G3 have overlapping or **redundant functions**. They likely act in parallel downstream of G2, and while the loss of one can be partially compensated for by the other, the loss of both is catastrophic to the pathway. \"Gene redundancy\" is the appropriate term to describe this relationship.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's assess each option based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. Our analysis points to G2.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Incorrect. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We are only observing one trait (resistance).\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: Correct, but the first part of the statement is wrong.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Incorrect.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is plausible if G2 regulates them both, but not directly proven by the data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.** This aligns perfectly with the epistasis data.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: **Correct.** This is the best description for the synergistic interaction seen in the `g1g3` mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect, based on the standard definition. However, the first two statements in this option are the most accurate and comprehensive conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment. It's likely that this part of the option is flawed, but the other parts are strongly supported.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption D provides the most accurate description of the genetic relationships. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. Despite the inaccurate final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3, it is the best overall conclusion among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
