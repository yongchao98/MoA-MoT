    "This problem requires applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Define the initial state (before collision):**\n\n*   We have an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$). Let their rest mass be $m_e$.\n*   Let's set the direction of the electron's motion as the positive x-axis.\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   Relativistic energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Relativistic momentum is related to energy by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n    *   So, the magnitude of the electron's momentum is $p_e c = \\sqrt{E_e^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(4 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{15} m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_e = (+\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   Relativistic energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Magnitude of the positron's momentum: $p_p c = \\sqrt{E_p^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(2 m_e c^2)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{3} m_e c^2$.\n    *   The positron moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction.\n    *   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0)$.\n\n**2. Calculate total energy and momentum before the collision:**\n\n*   **Total Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Total Momentum ($\\vec{p}_{initial}$):**\n    *   $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0)$.\n    *   There is no initial momentum in the y-direction.\n\n**3. Define the final state (after annihilation):**\n\n*   Two photons ($\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$) are produced.\n*   Photons are massless, so their energy is $E = pc$.\n*   The problem states the photons have the same energy, $E_{\\gamma1} = E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{final} = E_{initial}$\n    *   $E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2} = 6 m_e c^2$\n    *   $2 E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2 \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   The energy of each photon is $3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   The momentum of each photon has magnitude $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Let the first photon ($\\gamma_1$) move at an angle $\\theta$ above the x-axis, and the second photon ($\\gamma_2$) move at an angle $-\\phi$ below the x-axis.\n    *   The momentum vectors are:\n        *   $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta, p_\\gamma \\sin\\theta)$\n        *   $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma2} = (p_\\gamma \\cos(-\\phi), p_\\gamma \\sin(-\\phi)) = (p_\\gamma \\cos\\phi, -p_\\gamma \\sin\\phi)$\n    *   The total final momentum is $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma2}$.\n    *   $\\vec{p}_{final} = (p_\\gamma(\\cos\\theta + \\cos\\phi), p_\\gamma(\\sin\\theta - \\sin\\phi))$.\n\n*   **Equating initial and final momentum components:**\n    *   **y-component:** The initial y-momentum is 0.\n        *   $p_{final, y} = p_\\gamma(\\sin\\theta - \\sin\\phi) = 0 \\implies \\sin\\theta = \\sin\\phi$.\n        *   This means the angles are equal in magnitude, $\\theta = \\phi$. The photons are emitted symmetrically with respect to the x-axis.\n    *   **x-component:**\n        *   $p_{initial, x} = p_{final, x}$\n        *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = p_\\gamma(\\cos\\theta + \\cos\\theta) = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n        *   We know $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$.\n        *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta$.\n        *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 6 \\cos\\theta$.\n        *   $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the final angle:**\n\nThe angle between the two photons is the sum of the angle of the first photon above the axis ($\\theta$) and the angle of the second photon below the axis ($\\theta$), which is $2\\theta$. We first need to calculate $\\theta$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_degrees\n\nprint(total_angle)\n```\n>96.40693510886193\n\nThe calculated angle is approximately 96.4 degrees. The closest answer choice is 96.\n\n<<<D>>>",
