    "Here is my step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: `Mass_H / Total_Mass = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`.\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction 14.28% is very close to 14.2857%, which is exactly 1/7.\n*   Let's set the mass fraction to 1/7:\n    `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    `7m = 12n + m`\n    `6m = 12n`\n    `m = 2n`\n*   This gives the empirical formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's verify the formula for cyclohexane: n=6, m=2*6=12. The formula C6H12 matches the CnH2n pattern.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Since Z (cyclohexane) is already saturated, it won't change upon hydrogenation. The other component of Y must therefore hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   This implies the other component has the same C6 carbon skeleton. A common C6 aromatic compound that is a liquid solvent and hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst.\n*   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction.\n*   In this context, disproportionation involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms. One molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The reaction is: `Mixture X -> Mixture Y`. Since both are equimolar mixtures, let the components of X be X1 and X2. The reaction can be represented as:\n    `X1 + X2 -> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n*   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    `H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(Cyclohexane) + H_atoms(Benzene)`\n    `H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = 12 + 6`\n    `H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = 18`\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X contains two liquids that decolorize bromine water, meaning they contain C=C double bonds (they are unsaturated).\n*   The problem states that all compounds in X and Y hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane), so the compounds in X must also have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   We are also told that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   Let's consider the possible unsaturated C6-ring molecules (cycloalkenes/dienes) that are not conjugated:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Contains one double bond. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Contains two non-conjugated double bonds. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   (Note: Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated).\n*   We need to find a combination of two of these molecules such that the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   If X = {Cyclohexene, Cyclohexene}, total H = 10 + 10 = 20 (Incorrect).\n    *   If X = {Cyclohexa-1,4-diene, Cyclohexa-1,4-diene}, total H = 8 + 8 = 16 (Incorrect).\n    *   If X = {Cyclohexene, Cyclohexa-1,4-diene}, total H = 10 + 8 = 18 (Correct).\n*   Thus, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n*   This is consistent with the disproportionation reaction:\n    `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\n    In this reaction, cyclohexene gains 2H (reduction) to become cyclohexane, and cyclohexa-1,4-diene loses 2H (oxidation) to become benzene.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
