    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n    DBE = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a carbonyl group C=O, DBE=1).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift in the 9-10 ppm range is indicative of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**. The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), meaning it is coupled to two adjacent equivalent protons, consistent with a -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a **methylene group (-CH2-)**. The integration (2H) and splitting (doublet, d) confirm that it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This coupling pattern, a doublet at 3.66 ppm and a triplet at 9.72 ppm, confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment (an acetaldehyde group).\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (less than 7 ppm), indicating the presence of an electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of an **amino group (-NH2)**. The nitrogen atom in the molecular formula supports this assignment. The amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure of the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify its formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This matches the given molecular formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This is the standard procedure for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride** [(Cl-)(+N2)-C6H4-CH2CHO].\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Adding water to an aqueous solution of an arenediazonium salt and warming it results in the hydrolysis of the diazonium group, replacing it with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a common synthesis method for phenols.\n    The diazonium salt is converted to **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** [HO-C6H4-CH2CHO].\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that possesses acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). When treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-**aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        *   Intermediate Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions indicates that the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage. The β-hydroxy aldehyde will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydrogen from the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated.\n\n        Let P = 4-hydroxyphenyl group (HO-C6H4-).\n        The aldol addition product is: P-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(P)-CHO\n        Upon heating, it dehydrates: P-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(P)-CHO → P-CH2-CH=C(P)-CHO + H2O\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    The final dehydrated product is P-CH2-CH=C(P)-CHO. Let's determine its IUPAC name.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde and the double bond is a butenal.\n    *   Numbering starts from the aldehyde carbon (C1).\n    *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it is a **but-2-enal**.\n    *   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached to C2.\n    *   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached to C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name matches option (A). Option (C) represents the intermediate aldol addition product, which is not the final product under heating conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1.  The starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n2.  Diazotization followed by hydrolysis converts it to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n3.  Self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde under basic conditions with heat yields the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
