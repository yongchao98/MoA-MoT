    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (butan-2-one) reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n    2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** Cyanohydrin formation is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n        *   The cyanide ion (⁻CN) from NaCN is a strong nucleophile that attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This addition breaks the C=O double bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃.\n        *   This intermediate is a strong base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    3.  **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺) for the final step. This is typically done by adding an acid.\n        *   `H₃O⁺` represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄) and is the standard way to represent the proton source for this step.\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is used in a different reaction to form crystalline bisulfite adducts, primarily for the purification of aldehydes. It is not the correct reagent for protonating the alkoxide in cyanohydrin synthesis.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A is `H₃O⁺`.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base. The reaction proceeds in the presence of water (H₂O).\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid like HCl, the nitrile is heated with aqueous acid. The nitrile is converted first to an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** This would yield a carboxylate salt, which would then require a separate acidification step to form the final carboxylic acid.\n    3.  **Determine Reagent B:** Reagent B is the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and an excellent catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a single step (with heating).\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might slowly catalyze the reaction, it is not effective for complete hydrolysis and is not the standard reagent for this transformation. Strong mineral acids are required.\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is `HCl`.\n\n*   **Final Selection:**\n    *   Reagent A is `H₃O⁺`.\n    *   Reagent B is `HCl`.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
