    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept:** The problem involves a point charge near a conducting sphere. This is a classic electrostatics problem that is most easily solved using the \"method of images\". The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at a constant value, V = 0.\n\n2.  **The Method of Images:**\n    *   The electric field outside the conducting sphere, created by the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, is identical to the electric field created by the original charge `q` and a carefully chosen \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere.\n    *   The purpose of the image charge is to create a potential that, when combined with the potential from the real charge `q`, makes the total potential on the surface of the sphere equal to zero (the grounded condition).\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d'):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The radius is `R`.\n    *   The real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n    *   Through standard derivation (which involves setting the potential at a general point on the sphere's surface to zero), the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are found to be:\n        *   **Position of image charge (d'):** `d' = R^2 / d`. This position is measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the real charge `q`. Since `d > R`, `d'` will be less than `R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere.\n        *   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):** `q' = -q * (R / d)`. The image charge has the opposite sign to the real charge, which is expected as the sphere will attract the charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):**\n    There are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n    *   **Method A: Work Done**\n        *   The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where U=0) to its final position at distance `d`.\n        *   `U = W = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`, where `F(x)` is the force exerted by the grounded sphere on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center.\n        *   This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n        *   When `q` is at `x`, its image `q'(x) = -qR/x` is at `x' = R^2/x`.\n        *   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - x')^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n        *   The potential energy is the integral of this force (with a negative sign because `U = ∫ F_ext dx` and `F_ext = -F_electrostatic`).\n        *   `U = - ∫[∞, d] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n        *   `U = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n        *   Using u-substitution with `u = x^2 - R^2` and `du = 2x dx`:\n        *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫ [1/u^2] du = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]`\n        *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n        *   `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / ∞)]`\n        *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method B: Using Potential (Simpler)**\n        *   The energy of a system of charges and conductors can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n        *   In our system, the charges are the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge on the sphere.\n        *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * ∫ σ V_sphere dS`\n        *   Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`, so the second term is zero.\n        *   The energy is simply `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n        *   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n        *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d' = R^2/d`) is `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n        *   The potential from `q'` at the location of `q` is:\n        *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d') = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        *   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        *   Now, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n        *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result. The potential energy is negative, indicating an attractive force between the charge and the grounded sphere.\n\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
