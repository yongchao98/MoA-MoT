    "This problem requires us to relate the temperatures of two stars using the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (let's call it state 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (state 1):\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ is the number of atoms in the excited state.\n*   N₁ is the number of atoms in the lower state (we can assume this is the ground state).\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the two states. This ratio (g₂/g₁) is a constant for a specific atomic transition.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two states (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the absolute temperature of the system (in this case, the effective temperature of the star's photosphere).\n\n**2. Set up the Equations for Both Stars**\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state for star_1 is double that for star_2.\n\nLet R = N₂ / N₁ be the excitation ratio.\nFor star 1 (temperature T₁):\nR₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T₂):\nR₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nThe problem gives us the relationship:\nR₁ = 2 * R₂\n\n**3. Solve for the Relationship Between T₁ and T₂**\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n\n(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is the same on both sides, as it's the same iron atom transition, so it cancels out:\n\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(eˣ) = x:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\nΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides:\n*   Energy difference, ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   The Boltzmann constant, k, is a fundamental physical constant with a value of approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio ΔE / k:\n\nΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nThe problem is designed such that this ratio is equal to 1. Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
