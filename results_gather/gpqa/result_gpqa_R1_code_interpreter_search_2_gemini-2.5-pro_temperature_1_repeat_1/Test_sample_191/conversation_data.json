    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is a small spherical cavity. A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n\n2.  **Apply Gauss's Law and properties of conductors:**\n    *   A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero.\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface is proportional to the net charge enclosed ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$).\n    *   Since the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total flux is zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface, $Q_{enc}$, must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed consists of the charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity wall.\n    *   Therefore, to make the total enclosed charge zero, a charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Consider the overall charge of the conductor:**\n    *   The problem states that the spherical conductor is initially uncharged (neutral).\n    *   We've established that a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface.\n    *   To maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. This charge will reside on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Determine the distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the charge distribution on its outer surface.\n    *   The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall) has no effect on the charge distribution on the outer surface, nor does it directly produce any electric field outside the conductor. The net field from the charge in the cavity and the induced charge on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is only influenced by itself. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields mentioned, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to achieve the lowest energy state (maximum separation).\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:**\n    *   The electric field at the external point P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge were concentrated in a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given information:**\n    *   The radius of the cavity ($r$), the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center ($s$), the distance of point P from the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. This information is extraneous and serves to test the understanding of the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is determined only by the total charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\nFinal Answer is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
