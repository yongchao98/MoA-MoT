    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane is a rigid, tricyclic alkane. The bromine atoms are at tertiary bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions. A simple S_N2 or E2 reaction is unlikely or difficult at a bridgehead carbon. High temperature and strong base acting on a dihalide suggest a complex reaction, likely involving skeletal rearrangement.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2H + 10H + 2H = 14 protons. This is the same number of protons as the starting material. This implies that the reaction is a substitution of the two bromine atoms with one oxygen atom to form a ketone, with the molecular formula C10H14O. No HBr was eliminated.\n*   **Reaction and Structure:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to cause a cage rearrangement. While the provided NMR data (especially the 4.79 ppm shift) is unusual and may be erroneous or for a specific isomer, the most chemically plausible ketone product formed from this rearrangement is a **protoadamantanone**, such as protoadamantan-4-one. Let's denote Product 1 as a rearranged ketone with the formula C10H14O.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   **Reaction:** This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. However, the problem also states the mixture is heated. Al(O-iPr)₃ is a Lewis acid, and heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid catalyst promotes **dehydration** to form an alkene.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  The ketone (Product 1) is reduced to the corresponding alcohol.\n    2.  This intermediate alcohol is then dehydrated to form an alkene (Product 2).\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The intermediate alcohol (a protoadamantanol) is unstable. Upon protonation by the Lewis acid, it loses water to form a carbocation (protoadamantyl cation). This cation readily rearranges to the more stable **2-adamantyl cation**. This cation then loses a proton (H⁺) from an adjacent methylene (CH₂) group to form a stable alkene. The resulting alkene is **tricyclo[3.3.1.1³'⁷]dec-2-ene**, often simply called \"adamantene\". Product 2 is this alkene (C10H14). This reaction sequence makes sense of the following step.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 2 (an alkene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard **ozonolysis with reductive workup**. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (C=O).\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** Ozonolysis of the C=C bond in adamantene (Product 2) cleaves one of the rings of the cage structure. The product is a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound. Although there appears to be an inconsistency in the atom count if we trace back from the very beginning (the most common literature product for this sequence is C9, not C10), the logical product from the ozonolysis of C10H14-alkene is a C10H14O2 dicarbonyl. The established product for this specific sequence (adamantene ozonolysis) is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. We will proceed assuming this is the intended product, as is common in such exam-style problems where a known chemical pathway is tested.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This molecule is highly symmetrical (C2v point group). It consists of two six-membered rings fused together in a boat-boat conformation, with a one-carbon bridge.\n*   **Proton Environments:**\n    *   There are two equivalent bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5).\n    *   There are eight equivalent alpha-protons on the carbons next to the ketones (C2, C4, C6, C8).\n    *   There are two protons on the one-carbon bridge (C9).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In such a strained, bicyclic dione, the most deshielded protons are the **bridgehead protons** (H1 and H5) due to the proximity of the carbonyl groups and the overall geometry.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Proton (H1):**\n    *   The bridgehead proton H1 is coupled to its neighboring protons.\n    *   The neighbors are the two protons on C2, the two protons on C8, and the two protons on C9.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry (C2v), the four alpha-protons on C2 and C8 that H1 couples to are split into two sets of two (axial-like and equatorial-like), but due to conformational averaging or accidental chemical shift equivalence, they often behave as a single set of four equivalent protons.\n    *   Coupling of a proton to `n` equivalent neighboring protons results in a signal split into `n+1` lines (the n+1 rule).\n    *   Here, H1 couples to the four nearly equivalent alpha-protons on C2 and C8. Therefore, n=4.\n    *   The resulting signal is split into n+1 = 4+1 = 5 lines. This pattern is called a **pentet** (or quintet).\n    *   The coupling to the two protons on C9 is typically smaller and may not be resolved, or may just lead to broadening of the pentet peaks. The dominant, observable pattern is the pentet.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is the bridgehead proton. It is coupled to four adjacent alpha-protons, which are effectively equivalent. According to the n+1 rule, this results in a pentet.\n\n<<<A>>>"
