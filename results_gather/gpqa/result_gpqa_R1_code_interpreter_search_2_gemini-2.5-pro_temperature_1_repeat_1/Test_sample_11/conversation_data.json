    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of the Decay:**\n    The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). The decay process is:\n    `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n    Since the Pi(+) is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. This is a classic two-body decay problem, which can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The Pi(+) particle is stationary.\n    *   Rest energy of Pi(+) (M_pi * c²): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of mu(+) (M_mu * c²): 105.7 MeV\n    *   The neutrino (nu) is assumed to be massless, so its rest energy (M_nu * c²) is 0 MeV.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum of the system is zero because the Pi(+) is at rest. To conserve momentum, the two product particles (mu+ and nu) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n        `p_mu = p`\n        `p_nu = p`\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is just the rest energy of the stationary Pi(+). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the mu(+) and the neutrino.\n        `E_initial = E_final`\n        `M_pi * c² = E_mu_total + E_nu_total`\n\n4.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy (E_total) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation:\n    `E_total² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n\n    *   For the muon (mu+):\n        `E_mu_total² = (p*c)² + (M_mu * c²)²`\n        `E_mu_total = sqrt((p*c)² + (M_mu * c²)²)`\n\n    *   For the massless neutrino (nu):\n        `E_nu_total² = (p*c)² + (0)²`\n        `E_nu_total = p*c`\n        For a massless particle, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy. So, `KE_nu = p*c`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Momentum (p*c):**\n    Substitute the expressions for the total energies back into the energy conservation equation:\n    `M_pi * c² = sqrt((p*c)² + (M_mu * c²)²) + p*c`\n\n    To solve for `p*c`, rearrange the equation:\n    `M_pi * c² - p*c = sqrt((p*c)² + (M_mu * c²)²)`\n\n    Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    `(M_pi * c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (M_mu * c²)²`\n    `(M_pi * c²)² - 2 * (M_pi * c²) * (p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (M_mu * c²)²`\n\n    The `(p*c)²` term cancels out on both sides:\n    `(M_pi * c²)² - 2 * (M_pi * c²) * (p*c) = (M_mu * c²)²`\n\n    Isolate the `p*c` term:\n    `2 * (M_pi * c²) * (p*c) = (M_pi * c²)² - (M_mu * c²)²`\n    `p*c = [ (M_pi * c²)² - (M_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (M_pi * c²) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n    Now, we can use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu):**\n        As derived, `KE_nu = p*c`. We can calculate this value.\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):**\n        The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n        `KE_mu = E_mu_total - M_mu * c²`\n        We can also find it by noting that the total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies:\n        `KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = (M_pi - M_mu - M_nu) * c²`\n        `KE_mu = (M_pi * c² - M_mu * c²) - KE_nu`\n\n```python\n# Given rest energies in MeV\nM_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest energy of Pi(+)\nM_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest energy of mu(+)\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (p*c), which is equal to the neutrino's kinetic energy\npc = ((M_pi_c2**2) - (M_mu_c2**2)) / (2 * M_pi_c2)\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# Calculate the muon's kinetic energy\n# The total kinetic energy released is the difference in rest masses\nQ_value = M_pi_c2 - M_mu_c2\n# The muon's kinetic energy is the total KE minus the neutrino's KE\nKE_mu = Q_value - KE_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nKinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): 29.78 MeV\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (nu).

Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.

Rearranging to solve for `p*c` (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy):\n    `p*c = KE_nu = [ (M_pi * c²)² - (M_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (M_pi * c²) ]`\n\n    The kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) is the total energy released (the Q-value) minus the kinetic energy carried away by the neutrino:\n    `KE_total = M_pi * c² - M_mu * c²`\n    `KE_mu = KE_total - KE_nu = (M_pi * c² - M_mu * c²) - KE_nu`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Let's use the provided values: `M_pi * c² = 139.6` MeV and `M_mu * c² = 105.7` MeV.\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu):**\n        `KE_nu = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)`\n        `KE_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n        `KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n        `KE_nu ≈ 29.78` MeV\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu):**\n        `KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78`\n        `KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78`\n        `KE_mu ≈ 4.12` MeV\n\n    The calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon (mu+) and **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (nu).\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated values `(KE_mu = 4.12 MeV, KE_nu = 29.8 MeV)` match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
