    "In quantum mechanics, when coupling angular momenta, the total magnetic quantum number *m* must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, *m* = *m*<sub>l1</sub> + *m*<sub>l2</sub>. This is a fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the expansion coefficients used to express a coupled angular momentum state in terms of the uncoupled states. If this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by |*l*<sub>1</sub>, *l*<sub>2</sub>, *l*, *m*> = |1, 1, 2, -1>.\n*   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both L<sub>1z</sub> and L<sub>2z</sub> as -ħ.\n\nThe eigenvalue of the L<sub>z</sub> operator is *m*<sub>l</sub>ħ. Therefore, measuring the eigenvalues of L<sub>1z</sub> and L<sub>2z</sub> as -ħ corresponds to finding the system in a state where *m*<sub>l1</sub> = -1 and *m*<sub>l2</sub> = -1.\n\nLet's check the selection rule:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the given state is *m* = -1.\n*   The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome is *m*<sub>l1</sub> + *m*<sub>l2</sub> = (-1) + (-1) = -2.\n\nSince *m* ≠ *m*<sub>l1</sub> + *m*<sub>l2</sub> (-1 ≠ -2), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states is zero. The probability of a measurement is the square of the absolute value of this coefficient. Consequently, the probability of measuring *m*<sub>l1</sub> = -1 and *m*<sub>l2</sub> = -1 is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
