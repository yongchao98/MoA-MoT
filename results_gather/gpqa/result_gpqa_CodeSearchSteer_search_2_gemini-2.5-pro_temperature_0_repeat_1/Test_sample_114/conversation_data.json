    "The problem describes a collision between an electron and a positron, resulting in their annihilation and the production of two photons. To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Initial State:\n\n*   **Electron:** Moving from the left with a Lorentz factor (γe) of 4.\n*   **Positron:** Moving from the right with a Lorentz factor (γp) of 2.\n*   The rest mass of an electron and a positron are identical (me).\n\n### Final State:\n\n*   **Two photons:** They have equal energy (Eγ) and move away from the collision point. One moves in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right direction, forming an angle θ with the horizontal axis.\n\n### Applying Conservation Laws:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Initial Energy (Ei) = Energy of electron + Energy of positron = γe*me*c² + γp*me*c²\n    *   Final Energy (Ef) = Energy of photon 1 + Energy of photon 2 = Eγ + Eγ = 2Eγ\n    *   Therefore: (γe + γp) * me*c² = 2Eγ\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Momentum is a vector, so we analyze its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components separately.\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle is p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n    *   **Initial Momentum (pi):**\n        *   The electron moves in the positive x-direction, and the positron in the negative x-direction.\n        *   pi,x = pe,x + pp,x = √(γe² - 1) * me*c - √(γp² - 1) * me*c\n        *   pi,y = 0, as both particles move along the horizontal axis.\n    *   **Final Momentum (pf):**\n        *   The momentum of a photon is pγ = Eγ / c.\n        *   The two photons move at angles +θ and -θ to the horizontal.\n        *   pf,x = pγ1,x + pγ2,x = (Eγ / c) * cos(θ) + (Eγ / c) * cos(θ) = 2 * (Eγ / c) * cos(θ)\n        *   pf,y = pγ1,y + pγ2,y = (Eγ / c) * sin(θ) - (Eγ / c) * sin(θ) = 0. The vertical components cancel out, which is consistent with the initial conditions.\n\n### Calculation:\n\nBy equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\nme*c * (√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1)) = 2 * (Eγ / c) * cos(θ)\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express the energy of a single photon as:\nEγ = (γe + γp) * me*c² / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for Eγ into the momentum equation:\nme*c * (√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1)) = 2 * [((γe + γp) * me*c² / 2) / c] * cos(θ)\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling out terms (me*c):\n√(γe² - 1) - √(γp² - 1) = (γe + γp) * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for the angle θ by plugging in the given Lorentz factors (γe = 4, γp = 2):\ncos(θ) = (√(4² - 1) - √(2² - 1)) / (4 + 2)\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ 2.141 / 6\ncos(θ) ≈ 0.3568\n\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\nTotal Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
