    "B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\n\nThe essential additional reaction step required to introduce regular branches from only ethylene is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to form short-chain alpha-olefins (like 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene). These alpha-olefins then act as comonomers and are incorporated into the polymer backbone by a second catalyst.\n\nStatement B is correct because catalysts based on chromium, a Group VIa transition metal, are widely used for the selective trimerization and tetramerization of ethylene. For instance, the Chevron Phillips chemical company employs a chromium-based catalyst system for the commercial production of 1-hexene through ethylene trimerization. Similarly, Sasol uses chromium-based catalysts for the selective production of 1-octene. These processes require the use of specific activators, often aluminum-based compounds, to initiate the catalytic cycle.\n\nThe other statements are incorrect:\nA) Aluminum-based activators, such as alkylaluminums and aluminoxanes (e.g., MMAO), are in fact essential co-catalysts for the chromium-catalyzed oligomerization of ethylene and are widely used in these systems.\nC) While various late transition metals are used for ethylene oligomerization, noble metals are not the primary choice for this specific industrial application, which is dominated by catalysts based on more abundant metals like chromium, nickel, and iron.\nD) The individual processes (ethylene polymerization and ethylene oligomerization) are implemented on an industrial scale in the US. However, a combined system where both reactions occur simultaneously in a single reactor to produce branched polyethylene is a subject of ongoing research and development, not a widely implemented industrial-scale process.\n\n<<<B>>>"
