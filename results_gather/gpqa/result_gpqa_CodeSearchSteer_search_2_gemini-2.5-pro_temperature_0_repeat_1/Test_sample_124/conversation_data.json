    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers for the three Cartesian directions.\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground state:** $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the same value of $n$. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. The energy is:\n\n$E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThe degeneracy for $n=3$ is:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$\n\nThe combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3 are:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - (3 states)\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - (6 states)\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1) - (1 state)\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these states: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
