    "The core principle to solving this problem is the memoryless nature of radioactive decay. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability.\n\nFirst, we must determine the decay constant (λ) from the information provided. The probability of an atom decaying within a certain time `t` is given by the formula:\n\nP(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) in terms of our known value, e^(-λ * 100):\n\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nSubstituting the value we found earlier:\n\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nThis is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. To find the decay probability, we subtract this from 1:\n\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
