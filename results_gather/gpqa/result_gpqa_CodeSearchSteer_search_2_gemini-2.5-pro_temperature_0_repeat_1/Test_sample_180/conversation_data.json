    "To determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch affects them.\n\n### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several reactions in the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The key reactions relevant to the 700-900 keV energy range are:\n\n1.  **The pp-II Branch**: This branch includes the reaction `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`. This process produces mono-energetic, or \"line\", neutrinos. The vast majority (about 90%) of these neutrinos are emitted at a distinct energy of approximately 862 keV (0.862 MeV), with a smaller 10% portion at 384 keV. The dominant 862 keV line falls squarely into **band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n\n2.  **The pp-III Branch**: This branch features the beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe`). This reaction produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with very high energies, up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to the flux in **both band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n\n3.  **Other Sources**: Other reactions like the initial `p-p` reaction produce neutrinos with energies too low to fall into either band (up to 420 keV). The CNO cycle also produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum, but their flux is significantly lower than the main pp-chain neutrinos and are not a dominant contributor in this specific energy range compared to `⁷Be` and `⁸B`.\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. The light-travel time of about 8.5 minutes means we are observing the immediate consequence of this shutdown on Earth.\n\n*   **Effect on Flux**: The cessation of the pp-III branch means the flux of neutrinos from Boron-8 (`⁸B`) decay drops to zero across its entire energy spectrum.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Flux in Each Band\n\nWith the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, let's assess the remaining sources for each band:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV)**:\n    *   The primary contributor to this band was the continuous spectrum of `⁸B` neutrinos. With this source eliminated, the remaining flux is negligible.\n    *   The dominant `⁷Be` line is at 862 keV, outside this band.\n    *   The contribution from CNO cycle neutrinos in this narrow window is very small.\n    *   Therefore, the flux in band 1 becomes approximately zero.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV)**:\n    *   The contribution from `⁸B` neutrinos has disappeared.\n    *   However, the pp-II branch is explicitly stated to be unaffected. This means the strong neutrino line from `⁷Be` decay at 862 keV continues to be produced.\n    *   This single, strong line source now completely dominates the flux in this band.\n\n### Calculating the Final Ratio\n\nWe are asked for the ratio: Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2).\n\n*   **Numerator (Flux in band 1)**: Is now effectively zero.\n*   **Denominator (Flux in band 2)**: Is a significant, non-zero value dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrinos.\n\nThe ratio of a near-zero number to a large, non-zero number is a value very close to zero. Looking at the given options:\n\nA) 1.\nB) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nC) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\nD) 10.\n\nThe value that best approximates a near-zero ratio is 0.01. The flux in band 1 is not perfectly zero due to minor contributions from other continuous spectra, but it is orders of magnitude smaller than the powerful `⁷Be` line flux in band 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
