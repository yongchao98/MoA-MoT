    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of `4π` that appear in the final expression for the amplitude, which is a result of the integration over loop momenta.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations using dimensional regularization, each loop integral in four-dimensional spacetime typically contributes a factor of `1/(16π²)`, which can be written as `1/(4π)²`.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The overall factor from the loop integrations will be:\n\n`(1 / (4π)²)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nBy examining the expression, we can identify the loop factor as `1/(4π)⁶`. We can now set up an equation to solve for `L`:\n\n`1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)⁶`\n\nEquating the exponents in the denominator gives:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`, we find:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with this finding:\n*   `alpha³ * g²`: These are coupling constants. The powers indicate the number and type of vertices in the diagram.\n*   `(Q/M)²`: This is a ratio of energy scales, a common feature in the results of loop calculations.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors resulting from symmetries and specific details of the diagram's calculation.\n\nBased on the loop factor, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
