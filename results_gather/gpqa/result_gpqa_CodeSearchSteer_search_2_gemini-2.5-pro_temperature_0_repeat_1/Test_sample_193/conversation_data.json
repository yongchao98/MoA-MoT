    "To find the partition function Z of the system, we need to sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system. The system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each of which can take a value of +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates:\n\n**Case 1: All three spins are aligned.**\n*   **State 1:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E₁ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State 2:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThere are 2 states that have an energy of -3J.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are aligned, and one is anti-aligned.**\n*   **Two spins are +1, and one is -1.**\n    *   **State 3:** S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n        E₃ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   **State 4:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n        E₄ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   **State 5:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n        E₅ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n*   **Two spins are -1, and one is +1.**\n    *   **State 6:** S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n        E₆ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   **State 7:** S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n        E₇ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   **State 8:** S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n        E₈ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n\nThere are 6 states that have an energy of J.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all microstates, which can be grouped by their energy levels:\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\nZ = (Number of states with energy -3J) * e^(-β(-3J)) + (Number of states with energy J) * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
