    "When an N-sided polygonal aperture has an infinitely large number of sides (N → ∞), it becomes a circular aperture. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. The diffraction pattern created by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) in a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture are given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / d\n\nGiven that the angles are small, the approximation tan(θ) ≈ θ is valid. In this formula:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   d is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   m represents the coefficients corresponding to the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nIn this problem, the apothem 'a' is the radius of the circular aperture, so the diameter 'd' is 2a.\n\nThe angular positions of the first two minima are determined by the first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nFor the first minimum (θ₁), the coefficient m₁ is approximately 1.220.\nTherefore, the angular position of the first minimum is:\nθ₁ = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\nFor the second minimum (θ₂), the coefficient m₂ is approximately 2.233.\nTherefore, the angular position of the second minimum is:\nθ₂ = 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis result is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
