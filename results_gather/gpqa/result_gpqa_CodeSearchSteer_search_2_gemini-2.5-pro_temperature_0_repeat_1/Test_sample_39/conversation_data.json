    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, the phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common way to describe a purification problem encountered during chromatography. This issue, technically known as co-elution, occurs when two or more compounds in a mixture fail to separate during techniques like thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography.\n\nChromatographic separation relies on the differential partitioning of compounds between a stationary phase (a solid adsorbent like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). The speed at which each compound moves is primarily determined by its polarity. Compounds with similar polarities will have similar affinities for the stationary and mobile phases, causing them to travel at nearly the same rate. Consequently, they appear as a single, overlapping spot on a TLC plate or are collected in the same fraction during column chromatography, hence the expression \"on top of each other.\"\n\nWhile other properties can be similar between compounds, they are less relevant to this specific phrasing in the context of chromatographic separation:\n\n*   **A) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these forces are fundamental to how compounds interact with the chromatography medium, saying compounds are \"on top of each other\" is a direct reference to their position after a separation attempt, not the interactions themselves.\n*   **B) Similar boiling points:** This property is relevant for separation by distillation, not typically for the chromatographic methods used for routine purification in a synthetic organic chemistry lab where this phrase is common.\n*   **C) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral compounds and is used to determine their stereochemistry, not for separation in standard laboratory chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the most probable reason for the chemist's lament is that the compounds they are trying to separate have very similar polarities, leading to poor separation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
