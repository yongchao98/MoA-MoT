    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, `-q`, on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the spherical conductor was initially uncharged, a positive charge `+q` must appear on its outer surface to maintain its overall electrical neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that the electric field inside the bulk of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero. This means that the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely independent of the position of the charge inside the cavity. The conductor effectively shields the outside from the inside.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. This is because, for an isolated spherical conductor, a uniform charge distribution is the only arrangement that results in a constant electric potential on the surface, a condition for electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor. The magnitude of this electric field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe location of the cavity (given by `s`), the location of the charge within the cavity, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n*   B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n*   C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n*   D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nThe correct expression is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
