    "An analysis of the compounds leads to the following conclusions:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it generally requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen). In benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond and do not have alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has hydrogen atoms on the carbons located between the carbonyl groups. These alpha-hydrogens are readily removed, allowing the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃), the second carbon atom is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since these four groups are different, the molecule has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
