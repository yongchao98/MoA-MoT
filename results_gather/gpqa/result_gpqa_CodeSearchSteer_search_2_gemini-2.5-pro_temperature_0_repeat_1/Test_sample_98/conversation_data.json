    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signal for the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This signal is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch in a carboxylic acid.\n\nThis information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data is consistent with all of them but does not help differentiate between them.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is true for all four candidate structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (causes the **d**oublet)\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (causes the **t**riplet)\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (causes the **q**uartet)\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (causes the **d**oublet)\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (causes one **t**riplet)\n    *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (causes the second **t**riplet)\n\n### **3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the chiral centers (the -CH- groups) for each molecule, as these are the most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C2-H (doublet), the C4-CH₂ (triplet), and its own C3-CH₃ (quartet). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to the C3-H (doublet) and its own C2-CH₃ (quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   This structure provides a `dtq` signal but **lacks a `dtt` signal**.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C4-H (doublet), the C2-CH₂ (triplet), and its own C3-CH₃ (quartet). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the C3-H (doublet), the C5-CH₃ (quartet), and its own C4-CH₃ (quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq).\n    *   This structure provides a `dtq` signal but **lacks a `dtt` signal**.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the C2-H (doublet), the C4-CH₂ (triplet), and the ethyl-CH₂ at C3 (triplet). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to the C3-H (doublet) and the ethyl-CH₂ at C2 (triplet). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure provides a `dtt` signal but **lacks a `dtq` signal**.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    Let's analyze the two central -CH- protons (at C3 and C4 of the pentanoic acid chain).\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to the C5-CH₃ group (3 protons, giving a **quartet**), the proton at C3 (1 proton, giving a **doublet**), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C4 (2 protons, giving a **triplet**). This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C4 (1 proton, giving a **doublet**), the C2-CH₂ group in the main chain (2 protons, giving a **triplet**), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C3 (2 protons, giving another **triplet**). This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThis is the only structure that produces both of the complex signals described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
