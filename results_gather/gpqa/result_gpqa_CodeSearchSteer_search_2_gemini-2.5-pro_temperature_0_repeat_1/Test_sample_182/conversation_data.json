    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula and Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n    *   **Structure:** It consists of a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4.\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is at position 1.\n        *   A formyl group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure. A cyclohexene ring has the base formula C6H10. Attaching four substituents (at C1, C2, C3, C5) removes four hydrogens, leaving C6H6 on the ring skeleton. The substituents are -H (at C3), -COOH, -CHO, and -CH=CH2. A more precise count based on the drawn structure (assuming standard valencies) gives C10H12O3.\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n        *   The molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n    *   **IHD of Starting Material:** The IHD formula is `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`. For C10H12O3, the IHD is `10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   This IHD of 5 corresponds to: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group. This confirms the structural interpretation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds are reduced to saturated hydrocarbons.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:** The reaction will reduce all reducible groups in the starting molecule.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The vinyl group at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton remains, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane).\n    *   The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CnH2n**.\n    *   Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) can be calculated from the molecular formula: `IHD = C - H/2 + 1`.\n    *   IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   Alternatively, the IHD can be determined by counting the number of rings and pi bonds in the final structure. The product is a cyclohexane ring with alkyl substituents. It has one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI results in the complete reduction of all functional groups and double bonds, yielding a substituted cyclohexane. A saturated monocyclic compound always has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1, which accounts for the ring structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
