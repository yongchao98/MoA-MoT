    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state occurs via the emission of photons. In the non-relativistic theory, the most probable transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state of the hydrogen atom is given as |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩, and the final state is the ground state |1, 0, 0⟩. The decay is stated to occur via two dipole transitions, which implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n**First Transition: |3, 0, 0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n\nApplying the selection rules to the initial state:\n*   Since l = 0, the change in the orbital quantum number must be Δl = +1. Therefore, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   Since m = 0, the change in the magnetic quantum number can be Δm = 0, ±1. This means the possible values for m' are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nFor a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease (n' < n). Given the options, the intermediate state has n'=2. Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2, 1, 0⟩, |2, 1, 1⟩, and |2, 1, -1⟩.\n\n**Second Transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩**\n\nNow, we consider the transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩:\n*   The change in the orbital quantum number is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', depends on the intermediate state:\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 0⟩, then Δm = 0, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, 1⟩, then Δm = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   If the intermediate state is |2, 1, -1⟩, then Δm = +1, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules:\n1.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 0⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n2.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, 1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n3.  |3, 0, 0⟩ → |2, 1, -1⟩ → |1, 0, 0⟩\n\n**Transition Probabilities**\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial |3, 0, 0⟩ state, the probabilities of transitioning to any of the |2, 1, m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. This means that each of the three possible decay paths has an equal probability. Since there are three possible routes, the probability for any single route is 1/3.\n\nThe transition route mentioned in options A and B is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe probability for this specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) suggests a probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is incorrect.\n*   B) suggests a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, which is correct.\n*   C) and D) suggest a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ for other valid routes, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct transition route and corresponding probability are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
