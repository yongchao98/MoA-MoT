    "The reaction sequence described is a classic multi-step synthesis in organic chemistry. Let's break it down step-by-step to identify the final product and determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1**\nThis is the acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed alpha-bromination of a ketone. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**\nWhen a cyclic α-halo ketone is treated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a ring contraction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\nThionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Thus, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is converted to cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at that stage without proceeding to the alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\nDue to this symmetry, we can identify the following sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (1H):** This hydrogen is unique.\n2.  **The proton on C1 (1H):** This hydrogen is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group and is also unique.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5 (4H total):** The plane of symmetry makes the two protons on C2 equivalent to the two on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter (prochiral center). This means they are in different chemical environments. Thus, they represent two distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4 (4H total):** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic, creating two more distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nCounting these up:\n*   1 type from the aldehyde proton.\n*   1 type from the C1 proton.\n*   2 types from the C2/C5 protons.\n*   2 types from the C3/C4 protons.\n\nThis gives a total of **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
