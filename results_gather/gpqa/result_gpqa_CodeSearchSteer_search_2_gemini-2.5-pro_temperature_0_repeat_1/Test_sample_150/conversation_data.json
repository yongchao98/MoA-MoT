    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for measuring an observable.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe goal is to find the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` on the system in state `ψ` will yield the value 0. This value (0) must be one of the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. The probability is then calculated by projecting the state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\n**2. The State and the Operator**\n\n*   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step a: Find the eigenvalues of the operator P.**\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n`det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = 0`\n\n` -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) = 0`\n` -λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0`\n` -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n` -λ³ + λ = 0`\n` λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n\nThis gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. Since 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible result of the measurement.\n\n**Step b: Find the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.**\nWe need to find the vector `|v₀⟩` such that `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]`ᵀ.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]`ᵀ = `[0, 0, 0]`ᵀ\n\nThis gives us a system of equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `(c, 0, -c)`. To normalize it, its length must be 1:\n`c² + 0² + (-c)² = 1`\n`2c² = 1`\n`c = 1/√2`\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector for `λ = 0` is `|v₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`ᵀ.\n\n**Step c: Normalize the state vector |ψ⟩.**\nThe norm squared of `|ψ⟩` is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n`||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`.\nThe normalized state vector is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ.\n\n**Step d: Calculate the probability.**\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] · (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n`= (1/√6) * [(1/√2)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1)]`\n`= (1/√6) * [-1/√2 - 1/√2]`\n`= (1/√6) * [-2/√2]`\n`= (1/√6) * [-√2]`\n`= -√2/√6 = -√(1/3) = -1/√3`\n\nNow, square the magnitude:\n`Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
