    "To find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (M_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (M_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The π⁺ is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n\nWe assume the neutrino (ν) is massless (M_ν = 0), which is a standard approximation in this context.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum (let's call it 'p').\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, which is M_πc². This energy is converted into the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n\nTotal Initial Energy = Total Final Energy\nM_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy for a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   For the massive muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (M_μc²)²)\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nFirst, we solve for the momentum 'p'. Substitute the energy expressions into the energy conservation equation:\nM_πc² = √((pc)² + (M_μc²)²) + pc\n\nRearranging to solve for 'p':\nM_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (M_μc²)²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(M_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (M_μc²)²\n(M_πc²)² - 2(M_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (M_μc²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n(M_πc²)² - (M_μc²)² = 2(M_πc²)(pc)\n\nNow, we can find the value of pc, which is the energy of the neutrino:\npc = [(M_πc²)² - (M_μc²)²] / [2(M_πc²)]\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν)**\nSince the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, E_ν = pc.\nKE_ν = [(139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)²] / [2 * 139.6 MeV]\nKE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\nKE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ)**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy (KE_μ = E_μ - M_μc²). From energy conservation, we know E_μ = M_πc² - E_ν.\nKE_μ = (M_πc² - E_ν) - M_μc²\nKE_μ = (139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV) - 105.7 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nA more direct formula for the kinetic energy of the massive particle (muon) in a two-body decay from rest is:\nKE_μ = (M_π - M_μ)²c⁴ / (2M_πc²)\nKE_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6)\nKE_μ = (33.9)² / 279.2\nKE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This result is consistent with established experimental measurements.\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
