    "All the provided statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are accurate, with the exception of one. After a thorough review of the current scientific literature, the incorrect statement has been identified.\n\n**A) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex does indeed function as a heterodimer with 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity, playing a crucial role in proofreading and mismatch repair during RNA synthesis. The nsp10 protein acts as a cofactor, enhancing the nsp14-ExoN activity. However, the complex does not prevent the breakdown of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). On the contrary, studies have shown that the nsp14/nsp10 complex is capable of degrading dsRNA substrates. This activity is thought to contribute to the virus's ability to evade the host's innate immune response, which is often triggered by the presence of viral dsRNA.\n\n**B) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Research has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF3a can induce apoptosis. It achieves this by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, without changing the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is central to the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. This specific mechanism of action strongly indicates that ORF3a triggers apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic pathway.\n\n**C) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The efficiency of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting, a critical process for the synthesis of viral proteins, has been shown to have a linear correlation with the conformational plasticity of the RNA pseudoknot that stimulates it. Studies using optical tweezers have revealed that the programmed -1 frameshift signals of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 adopt two distinct conformations when subjected to tension. This is consistent with their similar frameshifting efficiencies.\n\n**D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is a translational mechanism where the ribosome shifts its reading frame backward by one nucleotide. [4, 13] This event occurs at a specific \"slippery sequence\" and is stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. [12, 14] In SARS-CoV-2, this process takes place within the 5' end of the genome, allowing for the synthesis of two large, overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, from ORF1a and ORF1b. [8, 26] The RNA pseudoknot structure that facilitates this frameshift is highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a very similar conformation and function. [15, 19]\n\n<<<A>>>"
