    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the reaction produces two products that are diastereomers of each other: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric and achiral Î²-diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketones creates new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Analysis of Products:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Products for HPLC Analysis**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound from Reaction II)\n\n### **Chromatogram Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will produce **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will produce **one peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the pair and will produce a separate, **second peak**.\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral and will produce **one peak**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
