    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\nThe six substances are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3** (Toluene)\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring are classified based on how they influence the rate and regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n**Meta-Directing Groups (Deactivating):**\nThese groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group is a very strong deactivating, meta-directing group. It produces almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of ortho and para products. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often cited as less than 1%.\n*   **-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It directs bromination primarily to the meta position.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group is also a deactivating, meta-directing group, similar in effect to the carboxylic acid group. For the related nitration reaction, ethyl benzoate yields about 5% of the para-isomer.\n\nAmong these meta-directors, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5. A stronger deactivating group leads to a lower proportion of the para product. Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate.\n\n**Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:**\nThese groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are deactivating but ortho-, para-directing. Due to the combination of inductive withdrawal and resonance donation, along with steric factors, halobenzenes often give a high yield of the para-isomer. For the bromination of bromobenzene, the para-isomer is formed in 85% yield. For the nitration of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer yield is about 70%. Chlorobenzene is highly selective for the para position.\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. In the bromination of toluene, the para-isomer is the major product, with a reported yield of 66.8%.\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is also an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. It is slightly bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions would be expected to favor the para-isomer even more than in toluene. However, experimental data for various electrophilic substitutions can be complex. For bromination, the para position in ethylbenzene has been found to be less reactive than the ortho positions under certain conditions, which is an exception to the general trend. In general, for alkylbenzenes, increasing the steric bulk of the alkyl group increases the para/ortho ratio. For example, in nitration, tert-butylbenzene gives a 75% para yield compared to 37% for toluene. While specific data for bromination of ethylbenzene can vary, it is an activating group and will produce a significant amount of para product, likely comparable to or slightly more than toluene.\n\n**Arranging all substances:**\n\nThe meta-directing compounds will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho-, para-directing compounds.\n\n1.  **Lowest para-yields (meta-directors):**\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) will have the lowest yield (<1%).\n    *   Benzoic acid (6) and Ethyl benzoate (2) will have slightly higher, but still very low, yields. Comparing -COOH and -COOC2H5, their deactivating effects are similar. Data for nitration shows ethyl benzoate gives ~5% para product. We can place them in the order 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n2.  **Highest para-yields (ortho-, para-directors):**\n    *   Toluene (1) gives a 66.8% para yield in bromination.\n    *   Ethylbenzene (5) is expected to have a para yield similar to or slightly higher than toluene due to sterics.\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3) is known to be highly para-selective, with para yields often exceeding those of simple alkylbenzenes in halogenation reactions (e.g., 85% for bromination of bromobenzene).\n\nCombining these observations, the overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
