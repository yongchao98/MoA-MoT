    "The proper starting materials for the two reactions are determined by the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3), and the stereochemistry of the products.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe starting material in the options is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid monoester. It has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The final products are lactones (cyclic esters).\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and lactones to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The resulting molecule, a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid, will then undergo intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) under acidic workup (H+) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and subsequent cyclization do not affect the chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the (R)-product, `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reducing Agent:** Borane (BH3) is known for its \"exquisite selectivity\" in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving ester groups unaffected.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. This intermediate, a hydroxy-ester, will then undergo acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not involve the chiral center, so the original stereochemistry is preserved. To yield the (S)-product, `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
