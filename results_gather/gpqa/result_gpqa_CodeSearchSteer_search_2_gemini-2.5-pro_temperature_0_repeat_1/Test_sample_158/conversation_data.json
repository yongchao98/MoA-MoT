    "The observation of a significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than a peak in a quasar's spectrum is a hallmark of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) forest. This phenomenon occurs when the light from the quasar is absorbed by neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts between the quasar and Earth. The peak at 790 nm is therefore the redshifted Lyα emission line of the quasar itself.\n\nTo determine the comoving distance to the quasar, we first need to calculate its redshift. The rest-frame wavelength of the hydrogen Lyα spectral line is approximately 121.567 nanometers. The redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.567 nm) - 1 ≈ 5.5\n\nWith the redshift determined, we can now calculate the comoving distance using the provided cosmological parameters of the Lambda-CDM model: a Hubble constant (H₀) of 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, a matter density parameter (Ω_m) of 0.3, and a dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) of 0.7 in a flat universe.\n\nThe comoving distance is calculated by integrating the Friedmann equation. Using a cosmological calculator with these parameters for a redshift of 5.5, the comoving distance is found to be approximately 9 Gpc.\n\nTherefore, the value that can be assumed for the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth is 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<C>>>"
