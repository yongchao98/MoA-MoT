    "The problem requires us to find the relationship between the temperatures of two stars, T_1 and T_2, given the relative excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The population of different energy levels in a star's photosphere, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), is described by the Boltzmann equation. The equation relates the number of atoms in an excited state (N_excited) to the number of atoms in the ground state (N_ground).\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:**\n    N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n    *   g_excited and g_ground are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels, which are constant for a given transition.\n\n3.  **Apply to Both Stars:**\n    Let's write the equation for each star. Let C = (g_excited / g_ground) be the constant ratio of statistical weights.\n\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T_1):\n        (N_excited / N_ground)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T_2):\n        (N_excited / N_ground)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means:\n    (N_excited / N_ground)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4:\n    C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    The constant C cancels out:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperatures:**\n    To isolate the temperatures, we can use logarithms. First, rearrange the equation:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\n    Using the exponent rule e^a / e^b = e^(a-b):\n    exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\n    exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Numerical Values:**\n    The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n    The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\n    Calculate the ratio ΔE / k:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    The fact that this ratio is approximately 1 is a key piece of information intended to simplify the final expression. Substituting this value (and treating it as a dimensionless 1 as implied by the answer choices):\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    This simplifies to:\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
