    "To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we can calculate the energy gained per revolution and divide the final kinetic energy by this value.\n\n### Key Principles and Formulas\n\n1.  **Energy Gain per Acceleration:** A charged particle gains energy when it crosses the electric field in the gap between the accelerator's \"dees\". The energy gained is given by the product of the particle's charge (q) and the voltage (U) at the instant of crossing.\n2.  **Synchronous Phase (Φs):** In a synchrocyclotron, for stable acceleration, the particle must cross the gap at a consistent phase of the alternating voltage, known as the synchronous phase. The problem provides an initial phase Φ₀ = π/4, which is this synchronous phase.\n3.  **Voltage at Crossing:** The accelerating voltage is given by U(t) = U₀cos(2πν(α)t + Φ₀). The effective voltage during acceleration is U₀cos(Φs).\n4.  **Energy Gain per Revolution:** A standard cyclotron design features two gaps, meaning the particle is accelerated twice per revolution. Therefore, the total energy gained in one complete turn is twice the energy gained in a single gap crossing.\n5.  **Number of Revolutions (N):** This is the total kinetic energy achieved (T) divided by the energy gained per revolution (ΔE_rev).\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Identify the given data:**\n    *   Final Kinetic Energy (T): 950 MeV\n    *   Peak Voltage (U₀): 190 kV = 0.190 MV\n    *   Synchronous Phase (Φ₀): π/4 radians\n    *   Charge of a proton (q): This is the elementary charge, *e*.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy gained in one acceleration (in eV):**\n    The energy gain (ΔE_accel) when a particle with charge *e* passes through a potential difference U is simply U in electron-volts (eV).\n    ΔE_accel = U₀ * cos(Φ₀)\n    ΔE_accel = 190,000 V * cos(π/4)\n    ΔE_accel = 190,000 * (√2 / 2) eV\n    ΔE_accel ≈ 134,350 eV or 0.13435 MeV\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy gained per revolution:**\n    Since the proton is accelerated twice per revolution, the energy gain per revolution (ΔE_rev) is:\n    ΔE_rev = 2 * ΔE_accel\n    ΔE_rev = 2 * 0.13435 MeV\n    ΔE_rev ≈ 0.2687 MeV\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of revolutions (N):**\n    Divide the final kinetic energy by the energy gained per revolution.\n    N = T / ΔE_rev\n    N = 950 MeV / (2 * 190 kV * cos(π/4))\n    N = 950,000,000 eV / (2 * 190,000 V * (√2 / 2))\n    N = 950,000,000 / (190,000 * √2)\n    N = 5000 / √2\n    N = 2500 * √2\n    N ≈ 2500 * 1.41421\n    N ≈ 3535.53\n\nSince the number of revolutions must be a whole number, and the proton must reach *at least* 950 MeV, we round up to the nearest integer.\n\nN ≈ 3536\n\nTherefore, the proton makes approximately 3536 revolutions to reach the specified kinetic energy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
