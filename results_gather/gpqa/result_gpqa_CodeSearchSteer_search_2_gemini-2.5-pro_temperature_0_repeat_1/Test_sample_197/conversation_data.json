    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we must calculate the fraction of this specific complex relative to the total concentration of all cobalt species.\n\nThe relevant species in the solution are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free metal ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the complex concentrations, the [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leading to the following formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction and convert it to a percentage:\nPercentage = (0.4 / 2.3646) × 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
