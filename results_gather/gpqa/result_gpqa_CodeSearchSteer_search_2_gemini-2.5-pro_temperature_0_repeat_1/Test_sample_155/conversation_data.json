    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *trans*-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is a syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to the same face of the double bond. This process occurs with equal probability from either face of the alkene, resulting in the formation of a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides. The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, which are enantiomers of each other.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid workup (hydrolysis).** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide by water is an anti-addition. This means the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is attacked by water, the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at one of the two carbons, leading to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, when the (4S,5S)-epoxide is hydrolyzed, it also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The syn-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene results in a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting material is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is a meso compound.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid workup (hydrolysis).** The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide ring.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the meso-epoxide results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity, but they cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In this case, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will co-elute as one peak. The meso-(4R,5S)-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will have different properties and will elute at a different time, producing a second peak.\n    *   **Observation: 2 peaks.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer to the other two compounds. It will not be resolved further and will appear as a single, separate peak.\n    *   **Observation: 3 peaks.**\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
