    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of quasars so that their Lyman-alpha absorption lines can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range accessible to these instruments.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen occurs at a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation, effectively blocking light with wavelengths shorter than about 3500 Å. This atmospheric cutoff defines the lower limit of the \"optical window\" for ground-based telescopes. For a Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be detectable from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than this cutoff.\n\nThe relationship between redshift (z), the rest wavelength (λ_rest), and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is given by the formula:\n\n1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we set the observed wavelength (λ_obs) to the approximate atmospheric cutoff of 3500 Å.\n\n1 + z = 3500 Å / 1216 Å\n1 + z ≈ 2.88\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.88 is the minimum value required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into the visible range for ground-based telescopes. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3\n*   B) 1.9\n*   C) 1.2\n*   D) 2.4\n\nThe value of 1.9 is the closest to the calculated lower limit. A redshift of 1.2 would only shift the line to about 2675 Å, which is still in the UV and would be blocked by the atmosphere. Redshifts of 2.4 and 3 would be detectable, but they are not the *lower limit*. Therefore, a redshift of approximately 1.9 is the minimum required.\n\n<<<B>>>"
