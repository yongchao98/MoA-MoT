    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the provided chemical problem.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the weight changes in these tubes to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, indicating that no CO₂ was produced in the reaction.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in weight is due to the mass of oxygen.\n    *   Mass of O₂ reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Salts and Their Decomposition**\n\nThe initial substance is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, which decompose completely into gases upon heating. The products contain hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) in Gas C. The presence of hydrogen suggests the salts contain the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺), as it is a common cation in salts that decompose into gaseous products.\n\nLet's assume the salts are ammonium salts. The decomposition reactions for common ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen are:\n1.  **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** This salt is unstable and decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition can vary with temperature.\n    *   At temperatures around 200°C, the primary reaction produces nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   At higher temperatures or in the presence of catalysts, another reaction can occur: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nThe production of O₂ (0.025 mol) in the experiment indicates that the second decomposition pathway for ammonium nitrate is occurring. The remaining gas, C, is therefore nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **3. Stoichiometric Calculation**\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture consists of **x** moles of salt A and **x** moles of salt B.\n\nFrom the amount of O₂ produced, we can determine the moles of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) that decomposed.\n*   Based on the reaction `2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O`, the molar ratio of NH₄NO₃ to O₂ is 2:1.\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₃ = 2 × Moles of O₂ = 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, if one salt is NH₄NO₃ with x = 0.05 mol, then the other salt must also be present in the amount of x = 0.05 mol. Let's verify this by checking the other products.\n\n*   **Products from 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol (from the 2:2 or 1:1 ratio with NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol (from the 2:4 or 1:2 ratio with NH₄NO₃).\n\nNow, let's determine the products from the decomposition of 0.05 mol of the second salt, Salt A.\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 0.2 mol.\n    *   H₂O from Salt A = Total H₂O - H₂O from NH₄NO₃ = 0.2 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   **Total Moles of N₂ (Gas C):** 0.1 mol.\n    *   N₂ from Salt A = Total N₂ - N₂ from NH₄NO₃ = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the decomposition of 0.05 mol of Salt A produces 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.1 mol of H₂O. This corresponds to a reaction stoichiometry of `1A → 1N₂ + 2H₂O`. This is the exact decomposition reaction for ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n### **4. Verification of Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 mol of each salt matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol) = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g.\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **5. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
