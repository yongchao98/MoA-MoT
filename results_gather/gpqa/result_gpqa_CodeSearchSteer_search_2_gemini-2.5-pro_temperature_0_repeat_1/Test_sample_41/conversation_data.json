    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, orbital distance, and orbital period. The information regarding the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is not necessary for this calculation.\n\n### Key Formulas:\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital distance (a), assuming the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo.\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which for a circular orbit is the orbital distance.\n    *   P² ∝ a³ or P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Relate Temperature Ratios to Orbital Distance Ratios:**\n    From the equilibrium temperature formula, we can establish a relationship between the temperature ratios and the orbital distance ratios:\n    *   (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = √(a2 / a1)\n    *   (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = √(a3 / a2)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Distances:**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\n    Now, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances by squaring the temperature ratios:\n    *   a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n    *   a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\n3.  **Determine the Overall Orbital Distance Ratio (a3 / a1):**\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1, we multiply the individual ratios:\n    *   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law to Find the Orbital Period Ratio:**\n    Using Kepler's Third Law, we can relate the orbital period ratio to the orbital distance ratio.\n    *   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n    Now, substitute the value of a3 / a1:\n    *   P3 / P1 ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    *   P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 3.2\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
