    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Normalize the spin state:**\nThe given unnormalized spin state is represented by the vector:\n|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]\n\nFirst, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector |ψ⟩, so ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4].\n\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9(i²) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nTo normalize the state, we divide the vector by the square root of this value, which is √25 = 5. The normalization constant is 1/5.\n\nThe normalized state vector is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [3i, 4]\n\n**2. Define the S_y operator:**\nThe spin operator S_y is defined in terms of the Pauli matrix σ_y and the reduced Planck constant ħ:\nS_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\n\nGiven the matrix for σ_y:\nσ_y =\n```\n[ 0  -i ]\n[ i   0 ]\n```\nThe S_y operator is:\nS_y = (ħ/2) *\n```\n[ 0  -i ]\n[ i   0 ]\n```\n\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩:**\nThe expectation value is calculated as ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩.\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) *\n```\n[ 0  -i ]\n[ i   0 ]\n```\n* (1/5) *\n```\n[ 3i ]\n[ 4  ]\n```\n\nFirst, let's apply the S_y operator to the unnormalized state vector:\nS_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) *\n```\n[ 0  -i ]\n[ i   0 ]\n```\n*\n```\n[ 3i ]\n[ 4  ]\n```\n= (ħ/2) *\n```\n[ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ]\n[ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]\n```\n= (ħ/2) *\n```\n[ -4i ]\n[ -3  ]\n```\n\nNext, we multiply this result by the bra vector ⟨ψ|:\n⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) *\n```\n[ -4i ]\n[ -3  ]\n```\n= (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n= (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n= (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]\n= (ħ/2) * [-24]\n= -12ħ\n\nFinally, we divide by the normalization factor ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25:\n⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<A>>>"
