    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing activator. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Typically, the para isomer is the major product due to less steric hindrance and is carried forward in such multi-step synthesis problems.\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis is an oxidation reaction. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is a milder and more specific oxidizing agent, often used for the oxidation of benzylic methyl groups to aldehydes. Therefore, the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group.\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, also known as a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The sodium hydroxide acts as a base to remove an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone, forming an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens). The initial aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nThe structure of product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, is a largely planar molecule due to the extensive conjugation between the benzene ring and the enone system. To determine its point group, we look for its symmetry elements:\n*   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n*   **Proper axis of rotation (Cₙ):** There are no C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotation axes. The molecule is not symmetrical enough for such rotations.\n*   **Plane of symmetry (σ):** Assuming the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the atoms is a plane of symmetry. There are no other mirror planes (e.g., perpendicular to the molecular plane).\n*   **Center of inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Improper axis of rotation (Sₙ):** The molecule does not possess an improper rotation axis.\n\nSince the only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ), the molecular symmetry group is **Cₛ**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
