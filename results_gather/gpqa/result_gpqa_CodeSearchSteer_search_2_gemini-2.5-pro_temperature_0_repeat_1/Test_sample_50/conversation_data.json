    "To determine the net potential energy of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the method of images is employed.\n\nIn this method, the grounded conducting sphere is replaced by an \"image charge\" that, along with the original charge `q`, reproduces the zero potential on the spherical surface.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, the image charge `q'` is located along the same line at a distance `b` from the center.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -qR/d`.\n    *   Its position is `b = R²/d`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is equal to the potential energy of the interaction between the charge `q` and the fields created by the induced charges on the sphere. In the image method, this is equivalent to the interaction between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    However, a crucial point is that the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy of the real charge with the image charge. This factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed entity; it is created and maintained by the presence of the charge `q`.\n\n    The interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is calculated as:\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` = `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   Interaction Energy `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance) = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`.\n    *   `U_interaction = -k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`.\n\n    The net potential energy of the system is half of this value:\n    *   `U_system = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * [-k * q² * R / (d² - R²)]`.\n    *   `U_system = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
