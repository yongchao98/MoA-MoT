    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Synthesis of Product A**\n\n**Starting Material:** 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol\n**Reagents:** Tetrahydrofuran (THF), Potassium Hydride (KH), and acid (H+)\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of a tandem sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically an **anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement** followed by a **transannular ene reaction**.\n\n1.  **Alkoxide Formation:** Potassium hydride (KH) is a strong base that deprotonates the tertiary alcohol (-OH) to form a potassium alkoxide. This is the \"anionic\" part of the reaction name and it dramatically accelerates the subsequent rearrangement (by a factor of 10¹⁰ to 10¹⁷).\n\n2.  **Anionic Oxy-Cope Rearrangement:** The starting material is a 1,5-diene system, which is the requirement for a Cope rearrangement. The alkoxide undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement. This concerted reaction proceeds through a cyclic, chair-like transition state.\n    *   The bond between the spiro carbon and the adjacent carbon in the cyclohexene ring breaks.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the terminal carbon of the vinyl group and the other end of the double bond in the six-membered ring.\n    *   This rearrangement opens the spirocyclic system to form a single, ten-membered ring containing an enolate.\n\n3.  **Transannular Ene Reaction:** The resulting 10-membered ring intermediate is conformationally flexible. It can adopt a geometry that allows for a second intramolecular reaction. A transannular ene reaction occurs, where a hydrogen atom is transferred from a carbon adjacent to the enolate to the double bond within the ring, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n4.  **Tautomerization/Protonation:** The acidic workup (H+) protonates the enolate, which then tautomerizes to the final, stable ketone product.\n\nThe overall transformation converts the spiro[3.5]nonane skeleton into a bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane system. The final product, **A**, is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Synthesis of Product B**\n\n**Starting Material:** (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol\n**Reagents:** Acetyl bromide, Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA)\n\nThis reaction is a variation of the **Claisen rearrangement**, specifically the **Ireland-Claisen rearrangement**.\n\n1.  **Ester Formation:** The allylic alcohol, (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol, first reacts with acetyl bromide. While this could happen under various conditions, in the context of the subsequent step with LDA, it's understood that an ester, (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate, is the key intermediate.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It deprotonates the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group of the ester, forming a lithium enolate.\n\n3.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** The lithium enolate undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n    *   The carbon-oxygen single bond of the allylic portion of the molecule breaks.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the enolate carbon and the terminal carbon of the allyl group.\n    *   The double bonds shift accordingly.\n\n4.  **Product Formation:** The rearrangement results in the lithium salt of a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The starting material, (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol, has a propyl group and a hydrogen on the double bond. The rearrangement leads to the formation of a new stereocenter. The final product, **B**, is the lithium salt of 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid, which is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n*   Product **B** is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
