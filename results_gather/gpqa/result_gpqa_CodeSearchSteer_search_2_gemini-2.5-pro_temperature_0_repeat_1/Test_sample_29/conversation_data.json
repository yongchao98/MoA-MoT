    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first identify the color of the light it emits.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light using the given energy value. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. A convenient formula for this calculation when energy is in electron volts (eV) is:\n\nλ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n\nGiven the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV:\n\nλ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm\n\nNext, we determine the color corresponding to this wavelength. A wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green portion of the visible light spectrum.\n\nThe phenomenon described is fluorescence, where a substance absorbs light at one wavelength and emits it at a longer, lower-energy wavelength. This difference in wavelength between the absorption and emission peaks is known as the Stokes shift. Consequently, the energy of the absorbed light must be higher than the energy of the emitted light.\n\nThe emitted light has an energy of 2.3393 eV (green). Therefore, the absorbed light must have an energy greater than 2.3393 eV. Let's examine the approximate energy levels for the colors listed in the options:\n*   **Red:** ~1.8 eV\n*   **Yellow:** ~2.1 eV\n*   **Blue:** ~2.7 eV\n*   **Violet:** ~3.1 eV\n\nBoth blue and violet light have energies higher than the emitted green light. In fluorescent dyes, the absorption peak is typically at a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emission peak. For a dye that emits green light (~530 nm), the most probable absorption occurs in the blue region of the spectrum (~440-490 nm). Absorbing blue light provides the necessary energy for the subsequent emission of lower-energy green light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
