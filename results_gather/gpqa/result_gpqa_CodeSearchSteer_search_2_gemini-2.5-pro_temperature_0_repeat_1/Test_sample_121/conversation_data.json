    "The step-by-step synthesis leads to the final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination. The combination of bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride, while not the standard Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction, can achieve this transformation. Pyridine acts as a base, and acetic anhydride can form a more reactive intermediate. The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is esterified with ethanol using an acid catalyst (sulfuric acid). This is a classic Fischer esterification, yielding ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) has acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano and ester groups. In the presence of excess sodium hydride (a strong base), this carbon is deprotonated. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base then removes the remaining acidic proton, and the newly formed carbanion performs an intramolecular cyclization, displacing the second bromine atom to form a stable six-membered ring. The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane):**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals, which requires careful consideration of the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Chirality and Symmetry:** The central carbon of the cyclohexane ring (C1) is attached to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), and two different paths around the ring (C2 and C6). This makes C1 a chiral center. Due to this chirality and the two different substituents on C1, the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **one signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to a chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, they will produce **two distinct signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the ethyl group: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   At room temperature, cyclohexane and its simple derivatives undergo rapid chair-flipping. This conformational change averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon.\n    *   Because the molecule lacks any symmetry, the five methylene (CH₂) groups of the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all chemically distinct from one another.\n    *   Due to the rapid chair-flipping, the two protons on each of these carbons become equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n    *   This results in **five distinct signals** for the ring protons, one for each of the five non-equivalent CH₂ groups.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\n3 (from ethyl group) + 5 (from ring) = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
