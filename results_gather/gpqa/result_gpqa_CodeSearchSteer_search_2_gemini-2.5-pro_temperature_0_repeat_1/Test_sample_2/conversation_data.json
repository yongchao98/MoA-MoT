    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we can calculate the expectation values of σz and σx separately and then combine them.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator A for a system in a normalized state |ψ⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expectation value of σz. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.\n\nThe expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is calculated as:\n⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * σz * (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)\nSince σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩, we get:\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)\nUsing the orthogonality of the states (⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1, ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0, ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0), the calculation simplifies to:\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)(0.5) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ - ((√3)/2)((√3)/2) * ⟨↓|↓⟩\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) - (3/4)(1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of σx. The Pauli matrix σx acts on the basis states as follows: σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.\n\nThe expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is:\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * σx * (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) * (0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩)\nAgain, using orthogonality:\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)((√3)/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + ((√3)/2)(0.5) * ⟨↓|↓⟩\n⟨σx⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nNow, we can find the expectation value of the full operator, ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩:\n⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2)\n⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
