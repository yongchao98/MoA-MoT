    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both 25% titration and the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Molarity (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nThe starting concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) for the titration is **0.025 M**.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt any point before the equivalence point, the solution contains a mixture of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer. The pH of this buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **pKa Calculation:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    pH = pKa + log(\\[CH₃COO⁻] / \\[CH₃COOH])\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is therefore 25/75, or 1/3.\n\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to Reach Equivalence:**\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Concentration of Acetate at Equivalence Point:**\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    The acetate ion reacts with water to produce hydroxide ions:\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n*   **Kb Calculation:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:**\n    We can set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming 'x' is very small, we can simplify this to:\n    x² ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   **pH at 25% titration:** 4.26\n*   **pH at the equivalence point:** 8.52\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
