    "To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (4), we must first deduce the structure of product 4 by analyzing the given reaction sequence.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Formation of Product 1:** The first step involves the reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. The combination of a bis(dihalomethyl) precursor with sodium iodide is a method for generating a highly reactive diene, in this case, an *o*-xylylene derivative (5,6-dimethylene-1,3-cyclohexadiene). This reactive diene then participates in a Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornadiene derivative, which acts as a dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, one on each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene core. This results in a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Formation of Product 2:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) at the 7-position of the norbornane framework is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming the alcohol **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Formation of Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with the sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex in DMSO. This is known as the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The hydroxyl group of Product 2 is thus oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O), yielding the ketone **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Formation of Product 4:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C. Polycyclic ketones with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one (norbornan-7-one) core are known to undergo thermal decomposition. The most plausible pathway for Product 3, which lacks the original double bonds in the norbornane core, is a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This is the reverse of the initial reaction, favored at higher temperatures due to entropic factors. The reaction would break down Product 3 into its constituent parts:\n    *   Two molecules of the reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylene-1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   One molecule of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n\n    The bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one intermediate is known to be thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n\n    The other product, 5,6-dimethylene-1,3-cyclohexadiene, is a highly reactive isomer of o-xylene. Under thermal conditions, it will rearrange to the thermodynamically stable aromatic compound, o-xylene.\n\n**Final Products and Analysis:**\n\nThe final stable organic products of the reaction sequence are **benzene** and **o-xylene**. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"product 4\". This phrasing likely refers to the collection of stable organic products formed in the final step. We must therefore count the number of unique hydrogen environments in both benzene and o-xylene.\n\n*   **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high symmetry (D₆h point group), all six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. This gives **1** type of hydrogen signal in an NMR spectrum.\n*   **o-Xylene (1,2-dimethylbenzene, C₈H₁₀):** This molecule has a C₂ᵥ symmetry plane.\n    1.  The six hydrogens on the two equivalent methyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n    2.  The two aromatic hydrogens adjacent to the methyl groups (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent to each other.\n    3.  The two aromatic hydrogens further from the methyl groups (at positions 4 and 5) are equivalent to each other.\n    This results in **3** distinct types of hydrogen atoms for o-xylene.\n\nCombining the distinct hydrogen types from the products, we have 1 type from benzene and 3 types from o-xylene. Since these are two different molecules, all four types are chemically distinct from one another.\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 (from benzene) + 3 (from o-xylene) = 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
