    "To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful sequence of reactions is required to ensure the substituents are placed at the correct positions (1, 3, and 5). This involves considering the directing effects of each group added to the benzene ring. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) all in a meta relationship to each other.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the most effective synthesis strategy, which aligns with the steps presented in one of the options:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring. This is achieved by reacting benzene with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director and deactivates the ring for subsequent electrophilic substitutions.\n\n2.  **Bromination:** The second step is the bromination of acetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, it will direct the incoming bromine atom to the meta (position 3) position. This reaction is carried out using bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst such as iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** The final step is to introduce the nitro group. At this stage, the benzene ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 (meta-director) and a bromine atom at position 3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   When directing effects are in conflict, the position that is least sterically hindered and electronically favored will be the major product. In this case, both existing groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. The acetyl group strongly directs meta to itself, and the bromo group directs ortho/para. Position 5 is ortho to the bromine and meta to the acetyl group. More importantly, in a 1,3-disubstituted ring, substitution at the 5-position is strongly favored as both groups direct the incoming electrophile to this position. This reaction, using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), yields the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is the most direct and high-yield pathway. However, the options provided are more complex, suggesting a misunderstanding in the premise of the question options. Based on the most chemically sound principles for achieving the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern, a sequence starting with acylation, followed by the introduction of the other two groups, is the correct approach. The other options fail because they either perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on a heavily deactivated ring (which is not feasible), or they follow a sequence of directing effects that would not lead to the 1,3,5-product.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided options based on this correct three-step synthesis: `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4`. This sequence is a truncated version of option D. The additional steps in option D (reduction, nitration, diazotization, deamination) are nonsensical and incorrect in that order. However, since the initial three steps of option D are the only chemically logical start to forming a 1,3,5-substituted acetophenone derivative, it is the most plausible choice despite its flawed later steps.\n\n<<<D>>>"
