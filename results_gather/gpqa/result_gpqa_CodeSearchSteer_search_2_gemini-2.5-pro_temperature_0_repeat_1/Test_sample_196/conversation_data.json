    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Compound X from IR and NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is for protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the carboxylic acid), while the signal at 7.2 ppm is for protons next to an electron-donating group (an alkyl chain).\n    *   **Alkyl Region Signals:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to both a methyl and a methine group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton is likely a methine group (-CH) attached to the aromatic ring and also coupled to the neighboring methyl and methylene groups.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments -CH₂CH₃ (from the triplet and multiplet) and -CH(CH₃) (from the doublet and multiplet) connect at the methine and methylene carbons to form a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] which is attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n### **Step 2: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**\n\nThe second step is to determine the product of the reaction between 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and the reagents red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n*   **The Reagents:** Red phosphorus and HI form a powerful reducing system in organic chemistry.\n*   **The Reaction:** This combination is strong enough to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is: R-COOH + 6HI → R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) produced, allowing the reaction to proceed.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nApplying this reaction to our starting material:\n\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n*   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This matches our derived product.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This has incorrect alkyl and carboxylic acid groups.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group instead of a sec-butyl group.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
