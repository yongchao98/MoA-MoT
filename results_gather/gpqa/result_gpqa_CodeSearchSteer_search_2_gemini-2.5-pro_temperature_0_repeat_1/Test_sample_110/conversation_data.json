    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from the C6 position, leading to a single, specific enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), in a conjugate addition.\n4.  **Product Structure**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n5.  **Product Naming (IUPAC)**: To name the resulting product, the principal functional group is the ester.\n    *   The parent chain is an ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To number the cyclohexyl ring substituent, the point of attachment is designated as C1. The ketone group (=O) should receive the lowest possible number, which is C2. Following this, the ethyl and methyl groups are on C3, and the original methyl group from the ring is on C1.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) has two acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon). KOH removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which is the nucleophile.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n4.  **Product Structure**: A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. The structure is NO₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n5.  **Product Naming (IUPAC)**: The nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group.\n    *   The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon. This chain is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   There is a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
