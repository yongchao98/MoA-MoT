    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties\nThe nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 protons and 3 neutrons. This corresponds to the isotope Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}Li$). The total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) is A = 6.\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Mass of the Nucleus\nFor this calculation, we will approximate the mass of the nucleus by multiplying the number of nucleons (A=6) by the mass of a neutron. This is a common approximation in some contexts, although it neglects the mass difference between protons and neutrons and the nuclear binding energy.\n\n*   The mass of a neutron (mₙ) is approximately 939.565 MeV/c².\n*   The approximate rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus (m₀) is:\n    m₀ ≈ 6 * 939.565 MeV/c² = 5637.39 MeV/c²\n*   Converting this to GeV/c²:\n    m₀ ≈ 5.63739 GeV/c²\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe speed of the nucleus (v) is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n*   Substitute v = 0.96c:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total energy is given by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula for a moving object:\n\nE = γ * m₀c²\n\n*   Substitute the values for γ and m₀:\n    E ≈ 3.5714 * (5.63739 GeV/c²) * c²\n*   E ≈ 20.1335 GeV\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nThe calculated energy is approximately 20.1335 GeV. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 21.419 GeV\nC) 23.069 GeV\nD) 20.132 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.1335 GeV is closest to option D, 20.132 GeV. The slight difference falls within the acceptable range for the precision of the physical constants used.\n\n<<<D>>>"
