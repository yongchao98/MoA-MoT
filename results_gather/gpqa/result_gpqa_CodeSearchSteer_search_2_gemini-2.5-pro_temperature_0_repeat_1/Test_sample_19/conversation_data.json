    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear physics is a simplifying assumption that allows for the complex interaction between a probe (like a lepton in an electroweak interaction) and a nucleus to be treated as a collection of independent interactions with individual nucleons. This approximation is valid under specific conditions, primarily when the interaction time is very short and the momentum transfer is high.\n\nThe core assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the fundamental basis of the approximation. It assumes that the probe interacts with a single nucleon at a time, rather than with multiple nucleons simultaneously (which would be a \"two-body current\" or many-body current effect). This reduces the complex many-body problem to a more manageable single-body problem.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption means that neither the incoming probe nor the outgoing particles interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. This neglects what are known as \"final-state interactions\" (FSI), where the struck nucleon or other products of the interaction could re-interact with the remaining (A-1) nucleons.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** During the very brief moment of the high-energy interaction, the force of the interaction is assumed to be much greater than the nuclear forces that bind the nucleon within the nucleus. Therefore, the nucleon can be treated as a free particle, ignoring its binding energy.\n\nThe statement regarding the quarks (Assumption 3) is related to the internal structure of the nucleon itself and the models used to describe the nucleon's response (its form factors). While the nucleon's behavior can be treated relativistically or non-relativistically within the impulse approximation framework, the internal dynamics of the quarks are not a foundational assumption of the impulse approximation itself, which treats the nucleon as the fundamental entity.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
