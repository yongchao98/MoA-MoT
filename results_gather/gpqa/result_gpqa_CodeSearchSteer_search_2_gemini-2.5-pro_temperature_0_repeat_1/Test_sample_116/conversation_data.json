    "Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, known as enantiomers. A key feature that often leads to optical isomerism is the presence of a chiral center or an element of axial or planar chirality in a molecule, making it asymmetric.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. As a result, it can exist as two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and is therefore optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl (-OH) group, a hydrogen (-H) atom, a methyl (-CH3) group, and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) group. A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule asymmetric and thus optically active, existing as (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule, with the formula (C6H5)2CO, has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. While it can form chiral crystals, the individual molecule is achiral in solution because of this symmetry and free rotation of the phenyl groups. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Consequently, it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
