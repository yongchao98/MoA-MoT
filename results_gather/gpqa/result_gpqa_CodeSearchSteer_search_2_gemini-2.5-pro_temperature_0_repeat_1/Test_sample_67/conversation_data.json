    "When a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it undergoes a phenomenon known as Larmor precession. The magnetic moment of the particle experiences a torque from the magnetic field, causing the spin vector to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, often referred to as the \"spin up\" state.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment μ in a magnetic field B is given by H = -μ ⋅ B. Since the magnetic moment μ is proportional to the spin operator S (μ = γS), the new Hamiltonian is H = -γB * S_y, where S_y is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\nThe spin, which was initially pointing in the +Z direction, will begin to precess around the new magnetic field direction, which is the +Y axis. This precession occurs in the X-Z plane. As the spin vector rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate.\n\nThe angular frequency of this Larmor precession is given by the Larmor equation: ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field. The oscillation of the z-component of the magnetic moment occurs at this same frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<B>>>"
