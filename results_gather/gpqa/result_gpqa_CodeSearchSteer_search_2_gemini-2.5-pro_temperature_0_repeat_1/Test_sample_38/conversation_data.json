    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. This is calculated by integrating the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density, |ψ(x)|², is the square of the modulus of the wave function. For a complex number of the form (Re + i*Im), the square of the modulus is Re² + Im².\nIn this case:\n*   The real part is Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   The imaginary part is Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\nTherefore, the probability density is:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nWe are told that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. This means we must integrate the probability density function from 1 to 3, and the result must be equal to 1.\n\nThe normalization equation is:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\nThe integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), and the integral of 0.25 is 0.25x.\n\nSo, we evaluate the definite integral:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3\n\nEvaluate at the upper limit (x=3):\na² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a² * ln(4) + 0.75\n\nEvaluate at the lower limit (x=1):\na² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a² * ln(2) + 0.25\n\nSubtract the lower limit from the upper limit:\n(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nNow, we set this result equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
