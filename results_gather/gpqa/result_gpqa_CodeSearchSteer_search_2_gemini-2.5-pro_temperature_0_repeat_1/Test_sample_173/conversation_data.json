    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy, E_M = M * c² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, m1 and m2.\n    *   The more massive fragment is m1, and the less massive is m2.\n    *   Mass relationship: m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\nFrom the given relationships:\n*   Substitute m1 = 2 * m2 into the sum: 2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M, which gives 3*m2 = 0.99 * M.\n*   Solve for m2: m2 = 0.33 * M.\n*   Solve for m1: m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M.\n\nNow, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of m1: E_m1 = m1 * c² = 0.66 * (M * c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of m2: E_m2 = m2 * c² = 0.33 * (M * c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 3. Determine the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n*   |p1| = |p2|\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\nThe relationship between total relativistic energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)².\nKinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy: T = E - m*c², so E = T + m*c².\n\nFrom the momentum and energy equations:\n*   (p1*c)² = E1² - (m1*c²)² = (T1 + m1*c²)² - (m1*c²)²\n*   (p2*c)² = E2² - (m2*c²)² = (T2 + m2*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n\nSince |p1| = |p2|, we have (p1*c)² = (p2*c)².\n*   (T1 + m1*c²)² - (m1*c²)² = (T2 + m2*c²)² - (m2*c²)²\n*   T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)\n\nWe know T2 = 3 - T1, m1*c² = 198 GeV, and m2*c² = 99 GeV. Substitute these values:\n*   T1² + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)² + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)\n*   T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)\n*   396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n*   600*T1 = 603\n*   **T1 = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 6. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, p1 = p2. We can find the ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = [p1² / (2*m1)] / [p2² / (2*m2)] = m2 / m1\n\nSince m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2  =>  T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy, T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV:\n*   T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nConvert this value to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
