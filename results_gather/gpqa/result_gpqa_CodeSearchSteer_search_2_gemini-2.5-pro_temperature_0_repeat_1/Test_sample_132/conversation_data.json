    "The search results confirm the methodology used. The solution is a phosphate buffer containing the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. The pH of this buffer is governed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2. The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is then determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which depends on Ka3 and the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] established by the buffer.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components, H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n2.  Use the Ka2 expression to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+].\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n3.  Use the Ka3 expression and the calculated [H+] to find the orthophosphate concentration, [PO4^3-].\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nThe calculations performed in the thought process were:\n*   [H2PO4-] = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M\n*   [H+] = 8.109 x 10^-8 M\n*   [PO4^3-] = 6.235 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis result matches option C. The logic is sound and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and the resulting hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] of the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), the weak acid in the primary buffer system.\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), the conjugate base.\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution is a buffer formed by the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\n    We can find the [H⁺] using the expression for Ka₂:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) concentration:**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\n    We use the expression for Ka₃ to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
