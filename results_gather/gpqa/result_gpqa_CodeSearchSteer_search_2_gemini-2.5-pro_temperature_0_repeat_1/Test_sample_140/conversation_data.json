    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), abstracts a proton or a deuteron from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon.\n\nTwo distinct pathways are possible, leading to different intermediates:\n\n**Pathway 1: Abstraction of a proton (H)**\n*   The amide ion removes a proton from the carbon at position 6 (C6) of the benzene ring. This is the kinetically favored step because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a principle known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n*   This elimination leads to the formation of a **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium atom remains at C2.\n*   The nucleophile (NH2- or NH3) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 results in the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 results in the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n**Pathway 2: Abstraction of a deuteron (D)**\n*   The amide ion removes the deuteron from the carbon at position 2 (C2). This step is slower due to the stronger C-D bond.\n*   This elimination results in the formation of a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, as the deuterium atom is removed in this process. The triple bond forms between C1 and C2.\n*   Nucleophilic attack on this symmetrical benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, yields only one product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
