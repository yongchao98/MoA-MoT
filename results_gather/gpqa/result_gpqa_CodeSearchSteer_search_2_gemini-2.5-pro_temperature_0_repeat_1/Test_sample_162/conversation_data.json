    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n*   O: 15.999 g/mol × 3 = 47.997 g/mol\n*   H: 1.008 g/mol × 3 = 3.024 g/mol\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.845 + 47.997 + 3.024 = **106.866 g/mol**\n\nNext, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = **0.00093575 mol**\n\n### Step 2: Determine the volume of strong acid needed\n\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide by a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or HNO₃, represented by H⁺) follows this reaction:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ needed:** 3 × 0.00093575 mol = **0.00280725 mol**\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid that contains this amount of H⁺:\n*   **Volume of acid:** Moles / Concentration = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L\n*   Converting to cm³: 0.0280725 L × 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis volume is very close to the 28.05 cm³ listed in option B.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter dissolution, the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution contains the Fe³⁺ ions produced. These ions hydrolyze in water, acting as a weak acid and lowering the pH. The primary hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n**[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)**\n\nFor simplicity, this is often written as:\n\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)**\n\nTo find the pH, we need:\n1.  The initial concentration of Fe³⁺.\n2.  The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction.\n\n**1. Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n*   **[Fe³⁺]:** Moles / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L = **0.0093575 M**\n\n**2. Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka):**\nThe pKa for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion is approximately 2.2.\n*   **pKa ≈ 2.2**\n*   **Ka = 10⁻²·² ≈ 6.31 × 10⁻³**\n\nNow, we set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the hydrolysis:\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| **Fe³⁺**     | 0.0093575   | -x         | 0.0093575 - x   |\n| **Fe(OH)²⁺** | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| **H⁺**       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n6.31 × 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.0093575 - x)\n\nBecause Ka is relatively large compared to the initial concentration, we cannot use the approximation that 'x' is negligible. We must solve the full quadratic equation:\nx² = (6.31 × 10⁻³)(0.0093575 - x)\nx² = 5.904 × 10⁻⁵ - (6.31 × 10⁻³)x\n**x² + (6.31 × 10⁻³)x - 5.904 × 10⁻⁵ = 0**\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\nx = [-(6.31 × 10⁻³) ± √((6.31 × 10⁻³)² - 4(1)(-5.904 × 10⁻⁵))] / 2(1)\nx = [-0.00631 ± √(3.98 × 10⁻⁵ + 2.36 × 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.00631 ± √(2.758 × 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.00631 ± 0.0166] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\nx = (-0.00631 + 0.0166) / 2\nx = 0.01029 / 2\n**x = 0.005145 M**\n\nThis value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n\nFinally, calculate the pH:\n*   **pH:** -log₁₀[H⁺] = -log₁₀(0.005145) ≈ **2.29**\n\nThe calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm³) and the pH (2.29) are closest to the values in option B (28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04). The discrepancy in pH may arise from using a slightly different pKa value or considering further hydrolysis steps, but it is significantly closer to 2.04 than to the other options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
