    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n### Relative Speed\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v₁ = 0.6c and v₂ = 0.5c in the same direction. The relative velocity (v_rel) of the second astronaut with respect to the first is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### Total Energy\n\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**1. Energy of the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁) for the first astronaut:\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₁) of the first astronaut:\nE₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**2. Energy of the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n\nNext, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂) for the second astronaut:\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₂) of the second astronaut:\nE₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**3. Total energy of the system:**\n\nFinally, add the energies of the two astronauts to find the total energy (E_total):\nE_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n**E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing our calculated values (v_rel ≈ 0.14c and E ≈ 5.96 mc²) with the given options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
