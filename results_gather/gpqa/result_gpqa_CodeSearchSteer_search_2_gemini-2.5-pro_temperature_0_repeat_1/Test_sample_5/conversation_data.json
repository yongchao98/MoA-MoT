    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass *m* in the given potential, we first express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe use the standard transformations to Cartesian coordinates:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nFrom these, we have r² = x² + y² and x² = r² cos²(θ).\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The problem is therefore separable. We can write the total potential as V(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y), where:\nVₓ(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x²\nVᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 k'z² is given by Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω is √(k'/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is kₓ = 4k. The corresponding angular frequency is:\nωₓ = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the spring constant is kᵧ = k. The corresponding angular frequency is:\nωᵧ = √(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for each independent oscillator are:\nEₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m)\nEₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThe total energy of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the two independent one-dimensional oscillators.\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (nₓ + 1/2) * 2ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 1 + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
