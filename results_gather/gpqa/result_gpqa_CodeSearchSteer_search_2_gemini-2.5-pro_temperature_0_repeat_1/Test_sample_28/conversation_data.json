    "To determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze how each change in the DNA sequence affects the resulting protein. The goal is to disrupt the protein's function completely. The most effective way to do this is to stop its synthesis prematurely or alter its structure so drastically that it becomes non-functional.\n\nThe process of creating a protein from a gene involves reading the DNA sequence in groups of three, called codons. This process starts at the `ATG` codon and ends at a stop codon, in this case, `TGA`.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence Analysis:**\nThe gene begins with the following codons:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n- `ATG` is the start codon, initiating protein synthesis.\n- `TTT` codes for the amino acid Phenylalanine.\n- `CTC` codes for the amino acid Leucine.\n- `GCT` codes for the amino acid Alanine, and so on.\n\n**Analysis of the Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   The codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine, so this is a *silent mutation*.\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a *missense mutation*, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a *stop codon*.\n    *   This is a *nonsense mutation* because it introduces a premature stop signal. As a result, the synthesis of the protein will halt at this point, creating a very short, truncated, and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is highly likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’`\n    *   The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   These are two separate *missense mutations*. While changing two amino acids increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to changing only one, it does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact sequence, the codon `GGT` has been removed entirely.\n    *   This is an *in-frame deletion* because a full codon (three base pairs) is removed. This results in a protein that is missing one amino acid (Glycine). Additionally, there is a missense mutation changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). While this will alter the protein, it is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most definitive way to eliminate the function of the protein is to stop its production almost immediately after it starts. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence. This will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutations result in full-length (or near full-length) proteins with one or more amino acid changes, which are less certain to cause a complete loss of function.\n\n<<<A>>>"
