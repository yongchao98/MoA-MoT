    "To find the maximum speed of the 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the system remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n1.  **Total energy at maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is v = 0. The total energy (E) is the sum of its rest energy (mc²) and its potential energy (U). The potential energy stored in the spring at this point is given by Hooke's law as U = (1/2)kA².\n    Therefore, the total energy is:\n    E = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\n2.  **Total energy at the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero (U = 0). The speed of the mass is at its maximum, v = v_max. The total energy is given by the relativistic energy formula:\n    E = γmc²\n    where γ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). At maximum speed, this becomes:\n    E = (1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)) * mc²\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    By equating the total energy at the two positions, we get:\n    mc² + (1/2)kA² = (1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)) * mc²\n\n4.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    First, divide both sides by mc²:\n    1 + (kA² / (2mc²)) = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n\n    Next, we want to isolate v_max. Let's take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA² / (2mc²)))\n\n    Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA² / (2mc²)))²\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA² / (2mc²)))²\n\n    Finally, multiply by c² and take the square root to find v_max:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA² / (2mc²)))²]\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
