    "To determine the energy at which high-energy Î³-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for electron-positron pair production ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$).\n\nThis process is governed by the principles of special relativity and energy conservation. For an electron-positron pair to be created, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two interacting photons must be at least equal to the combined rest mass energy of an electron and a positron.\n\nThe condition for this threshold energy in a head-on collision between a high-energy gamma-ray (with energy $E_\\gamma$) and a low-energy CMB photon (with energy $E_{CMB}$) is given by the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $E_\\gamma$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the Cosmic Microwave Background photon.\n\nFrom established physical constants, the rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV. The problem states that the average energy of a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) is $10^{-3}$ eV.\n\nFirst, we need to express the electron's rest mass energy in electron volts (eV):\n$m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the threshold energy formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare this result with the given options, we convert the energy to Giga-electron volts (GeV), where 1 GeV = $10^9$ eV:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated threshold energy of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV corresponds to the energy at which gamma-ray lifetimes become limited by pair production with CMB photons. Comparing this value to the given choices:\n\nA) 2.6*1e5 GeV\nB) 1.8*1e5 GeV\nC) 3.9*1e5 GeV\nD) 9.5*1e4 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
