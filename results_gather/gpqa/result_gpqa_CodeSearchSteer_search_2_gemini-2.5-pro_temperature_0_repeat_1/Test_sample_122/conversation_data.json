    "To solve this problem, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Reference Frames:**\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame, which is known as the proper time (Δt₀) because it's measured by an observer moving along with the ejecta.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   Relative velocity (v) = 60,000 km/s\n*   Proper time (Δt₀) = 50 s\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n**3. Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Reference Frame (Δt):**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation and is described by the formula:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nwhere:\n*   Δt is the time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   Δt₀ is the proper time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor equation:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\nThe value of √0.96 is approximately 0.9798.\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n**5. Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt):**\nNow we can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame:\nΔt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Reference Frame:**\nThe distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame is its velocity (relative to the Galaxy) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nDistance (d) = v * Δt\n\nUsing the more precise calculation:\nd = v * (γ * Δt₀) = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\nd = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\nd ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\nd ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThis calculated distance is extremely close to option A. The classical, non-relativistic calculation would simply be velocity × time (60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km), which is option B. However, due to time dilation, more time passes in the Galaxy's frame, so the ejecta travels a greater distance.\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km rounds to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
