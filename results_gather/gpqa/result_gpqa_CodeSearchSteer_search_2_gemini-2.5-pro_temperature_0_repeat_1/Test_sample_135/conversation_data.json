    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can use the Divergence Theorem. The Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a closed volume is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. The volume is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n**1. Calculating the Divergence:**\n\nFirst, let's find the divergence of **f**(r) using spherical coordinates. The formula for the divergence of a vector field **F** = F_r **r̂** + F_θ **θ̂** + F_φ **φ̂** is:\n∇ ⋅ **F** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(sinθ * F_θ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ/∂φ\n\nFor the given field **f**(r), the radial component is F_r = 1/r², and the other components F_θ and F_φ are zero. Therefore, the divergence is:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r\n∇ ⋅ **f** = 0 (for r ≠ 0)\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence of the field is zero everywhere except at the origin (r=0), where the field and its divergence are undefined.\n\n**2. Applying the Divergence Theorem:**\n\nBecause of the singularity at the origin, directly integrating the divergence (which is zero almost everywhere) over the volume would misleadingly suggest the answer is 0. The Divergence Theorem provides a way to handle this singularity.\n\nThe theorem states:\n∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∬_S (**f** ⋅ **n**) dS\n\nWhere:\n*   V is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   S is the surface of the sphere.\n*   **n** is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface. On the surface of a sphere, the outward normal vector is simply the radial unit vector, **r̂**.\n*   dS is the differential surface area element. In spherical coordinates, dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n\nNow, we compute the flux of the field through the spherical surface of radius R:\n∬_S (**f** ⋅ **n**) dS = ∬_S ( (1/R²) **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** ) (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ)\n\nSince **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the expression simplifies to:\n= ∬_S (1/R²) (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ)\n= ∬_S sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nWe integrate over the entire surface of the sphere, with θ ranging from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π:\n= ∫[from 0 to 2π] dφ * ∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ\n= [φ] (from 0 to 2π) * [-cos(θ)] (from 0 to π)\n= (2π - 0) * [-cos(π) - (-cos(0))]\n= 2π * [-(-1) - (-1)]\n= 2π * (1 + 1)\n= 4π\n\nThus, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π.\n\n<<<C>>>"
