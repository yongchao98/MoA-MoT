    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance:\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star (`r`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). This is a fundamental concept in astronomy used for measuring stellar distances. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n    `r ∝ 1/plx` or `plx ∝ 1/r`\n\n2.  **Given Star Count Variation:** The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) in the observed region varies with parallax as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    This is typically interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`, which corresponds to all stars within a certain distance `r`.\n\n3.  **Express Star Count in Terms of Distance:** We can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into the given expression for the number of stars.\n    Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have `plx^5 ∝ (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5`.\n    Therefore, `N ∝ 1/(1/r^5)`, which simplifies to:\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This means the total number of stars observed up to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is equivalent to finding the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of `N` with respect to `r` (`dN/dr`).\n\n    If we express the proportionality as an equation with a constant `k`:\n    `N = k * r^5`\n\n    We can differentiate this equation with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r^4`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r^2\nB) ~ r^5\nC) ~ r^4\nD) ~ r^3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
