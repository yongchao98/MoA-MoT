    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. This concept is rooted in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that for a quantum state with a lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. The energy uncertainty, ΔE, represents the \"width\" of the energy level; it's not a perfectly sharp line.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n1.  **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has a much broader energy uncertainty and is the primary factor determining the required separation.\n\nThe total uncertainty is approximately the width of the first level, which is on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV. Let's compare this to the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than the calculated energy uncertainty of ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is significantly smaller than the energy uncertainties of both states.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is the only option large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>"
