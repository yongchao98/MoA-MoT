    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond, and the atoms involved in the double bond lie in a plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and, therefore, optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS), which specify a particular three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. This indicates that the molecule is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer, not a mixture. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This compound has two chiral centers (at carbons 2 and 3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds, and they are achiral and optically inactive despite having chiral centers.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. The (2R, 3R) configuration is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S). This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. As it is specified as a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The (R) designation indicates a specific configuration at the chiral center (carbon 1), which is bonded to four different groups. Since a single enantiomer is specified, the compound is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** An examination of this molecule's structure reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
