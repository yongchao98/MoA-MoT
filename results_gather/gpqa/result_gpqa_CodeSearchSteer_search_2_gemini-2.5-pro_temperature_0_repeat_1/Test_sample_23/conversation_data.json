    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:** The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of cycloalkanes (general formula CnH2n), as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is 2n:12n, which simplifies to 1:6. The mass fraction of hydrogen is therefore approximately 1/(1+6) = 1/7 â‰ˆ 14.3%. A search confirms that for cyclohexane (C6H12), the mass percent of hydrogen is 14.37%, which aligns with the given data. Z is also described as a widely used solvent, which is true for cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is formed from a disproportionation reaction of mixture X. Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z (cyclohexane). Since Z itself is a component of Y and is already saturated, the other component of Y must also be a saturated compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This is only possible if the other component is an isomer of cyclohexane that can be converted to it, which is unlikely under these conditions, or if the reaction products are cyclohexane and a compound that is stable to bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. A classic example of such a disproportionation is the catalytic reaction of unsaturated six-membered rings to form cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene does not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated. The reaction of mixture X produces an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). This is a hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction. The overall atomic balance must be maintained.\n    *   Products: C6H12 + C6H6 = C12H18\n    *   Reactants (Mixture X): X1 + X2 = C12H18\n    Since both components of X are hydrogenated to cyclohexane, they must both be C6 cyclic compounds. Let X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. Thus, a + b = 18.\n\n4.  **Apply Constraints to Mixture X:** The components of X are unsaturated but do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   There are two common cyclohexadiene isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) has its double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n    *   Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X must be cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n\n5.  **Verify the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The proposed reaction is: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene).\n    *   This reaction is a known catalytic disproportionation where hydrogen is transferred from one molecule to another.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
