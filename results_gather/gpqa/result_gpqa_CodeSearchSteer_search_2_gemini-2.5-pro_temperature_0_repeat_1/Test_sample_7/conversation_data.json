  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\nFirst, we examine the effect of each individual gene knockout on the plant's resistance to anthracnose:\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function leads to a partial loss of resistance (25% reduction). This indicates that G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype, but is not absolutely essential on its own.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function results in a more significant loss of resistance (50% reduction) than the g1 mutant. This suggests G3 plays a more critical role in the resistance pathway than G1.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely eliminates the plant's resistance to the pathogen. This severe phenotype suggests that G2 is a crucial component of the resistance mechanism.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants\nNext, we analyze the double mutants to understand how the genes interact with each other.\n\n*   **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants:** Both of these double mutants show 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to that of the `g2` single mutant. When the phenotype of a double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, this demonstrates **epistasis**. Specifically, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`. This means the `g2` mutation masks the effects of the `g1` and `g3` mutations. A common biological explanation for this is that G2 is an upstream regulator, such as a **transcription factor**, that is required to activate both G1 and G3. If G2 is inactive, then it doesn't matter whether G1 or G3 are functional, as they are not being \"turned on.\" This strongly supports the conclusion that **G2 is a transcription factor** acting upstream of G1 and G3.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** This double mutant has 10% resistance. Let's compare this to the single mutants:\n    *   Loss of resistance in `g1`: 25%\n    *   Loss of resistance in `g3`: 50%\n    *   If the effects were simply additive, we would expect a total loss of 75%, leaving 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the observed resistance is only 10%, meaning a 90% loss. This effect is much greater than the sum of the individual effects. This synergistic interaction is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**. This means that G1 and G3 have partially overlapping functions. While each contributes to resistance, they can also partially compensate for the loss of the other. When both are knocked out, the function they share is almost completely lost, leading to a much more severe phenotype.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\nNow let's evaluate the given conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The data strongly supports G2 being a transcription factor. However, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Since this experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), we cannot conclude that pleiotropy is occurring. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies that G2 is a transcription factor and that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy based on our analysis. The statement that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is incorrect, as the double mutant phenotype is more severe than either single mutant's phenotype. However, the first two points are strongly supported by the data, making this the most plausible option.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. The evidence points to G2, not G1, being the primary transcription factor due to its severe and epistatic phenotype. It also incorrectly suggests pleiotropy.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** While it's possible that G1 and G3 share a promoter if they are both regulated by G2, this cannot be concluded from the given data. Also, G3 is not epistatic towards G1. This option is not fully supported.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the data most strongly supports the conclusions that G2 is a transcription factor and that G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy. Option B is the only one that contains both of these correct statements, despite an inaccuracy in its third statement regarding epistasis between G1 and G3. It remains the best possible choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
