    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction from its ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data.\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in a **ketone**.\n    *   Signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** correspond to two different methyl (CH₃) carbons.\n    *   The remaining eight signals are in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 126-145 ppm), indicating the presence of double bonds and an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   Two sharp singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)** confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. One of these likely corresponds to the methyl group next to the ketone (an acetyl group, -COCH₃), and the other is likely attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 6.7-7.8 ppm) account for a total of 6 protons. The pattern of two doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H)** and **δ 7.71 (2H)** is a classic indicator of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**.\n    *   The remaining two doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H)** and **δ 7.68 (1H)** suggest a disubstituted carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  The data points to a **p-tolyl group** (a methyl group on a para-substituted benzene ring), which accounts for the CH₃ singlet at δ 2.31, the two aromatic doublets, and the corresponding carbons.\n    2.  The data also indicates an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃), accounting for the other CH₃ singlet at δ 2.28 and the ketone carbon.\n    3.  The remaining fragments are a -CH=CH- group and a p-tolyl group.\n    4.  Connecting these pieces gives the structure of an α,β-unsaturated ketone: **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    **Product Structure:**\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n    CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C-CH₃\n    ```\n    This structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O and all the provided NMR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction involves converting Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) into (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one using 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as a reagent.\n\n*   **Reactant and Product:** Compound X and the product have the same molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O), which means the reaction is an **isomerization** (a rearrangement).\n*   **Reagent and Conditions:** DABCO is a non-nucleophilic organic base. The reaction is carried out at an elevated temperature (403 K or 130 °C).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The transformation of an epoxide into a ketone is known as the **Meinwald rearrangement**. Research shows that DABCO can effectively catalyze the rearrangement of terminal epoxides (those with a -CH(O)CH₂ group) into methyl ketones (-COCH₃). The reaction conditions described in the problem are consistent with those reported for DABCO-mediated Meinwald rearrangements.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Compound X**\n\nThe reaction converts a starting material (Compound X) into a methyl ketone with the structure R-CO-CH₃, where R is the `p-tolylvinyl` group (CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-). According to the mechanism of the DABCO-mediated Meinwald rearrangement, the starting material must be the corresponding terminal epoxide, R-CH(O)CH₂.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Substituting the R group gives the structure:\n    ```\n       H   H\n        \\ /\n    CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C---C-H\n                      \\ /\n                       O\n    ```\n    This structure is **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-styrylepoxide: Incorrect molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O).\n    *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** Correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and the correct structure to yield the identified product via a Meinwald rearrangement.\n    *   C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: While it is a terminal epoxide, it would rearrange to a different ketone and lacks the p-tolyl group.\n    *   D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: This is an internal, not a terminal, epoxide and lacks the p-tolyl group. It would not form a methyl ketone.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
