    "The reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Epoxide:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic structure where an epoxide ring is fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, and a methyl group), while C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1 and C5).\n    *   **Nucleophile:** Me2CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate or Gilman reagent). This reagent acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH3‚Åª).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles that react with epoxides under basic conditions. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the given substrate, C6 is less hindered than the tertiary C1. Therefore, the methyl group from the cuprate will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction follows an SN2 pathway, which involves a backside attack by the nucleophile relative to the C-O bond being broken. This results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The starting material has an (S) configuration at C6.\n    *   The SN2 attack by the methyl nucleophile will invert this center to an (R) configuration.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide breaks, and upon acidic workup, this oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configuration of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) that are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps remains unchanged.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** A new methyl group is added to C6.\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The configuration at C6 changes from (S) to (R).\n*   **Formation of Alcohol at C1:** An -OH group is formed at C1, and its configuration remains (R).\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at C3 and C4 remain (R) and (R), respectively.\n\n**Product Structure and Nomenclature:**\n\nThe resulting product is a cyclohexanol derivative. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is designated as C1.\n\n*   **New C1:** The original C1, now with an -OH group and a methyl group. Its configuration is (R).\n*   **New C2:** The original C6, now with the newly added methyl group. Its configuration is (R) due to inversion.\n*   **New C4:** The original C4, with its methyl group. Its configuration is (R).\n*   **New C5:** The original C3, with its methyl group. Its configuration is (R).\n\nTherefore, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect structure and stereochemistry.\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention of configuration).\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect structure and stereochemistry.\n*   D) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Correct structure and stereochemistry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
