    "Based on the spectral data provided, the compound is identified as follows:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C9H11NO2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the typical range for a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. Its position suggests it is part of a conjugated ester.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This is the typical upfield part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). Together, the signals at 1.20 and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group is donating, and the ethyl ester group is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. This corresponds to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR would show a propionyl group, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (different IR and NMR signals) and is 1,3-disubstituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide (would show only one N-H band in IR) and has a formyl proton signal in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
