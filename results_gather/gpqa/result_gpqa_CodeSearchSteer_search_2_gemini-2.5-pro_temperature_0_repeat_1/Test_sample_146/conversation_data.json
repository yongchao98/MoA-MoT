    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Process and Conservation Laws\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). In particle physics, such processes are governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation (including rest mass energy and kinetic energy) must equal the total energy of the products after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial Energy\n\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. For the total momentum of the initial system to be zero (a common assumption in such problems, treating it in the center-of-mass frame), the proton would also be nearly at rest. Therefore, the initial energy is dominated by the rest mass energy of the two particles.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n*   An antiparticle has the same mass as its corresponding particle, so the antiproton's rest mass energy ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938.3 MeV.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies:\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Set Up the Final Energy Equation\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of type A (two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$), each with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since these particles are the result of the annihilation, they will be moving at high velocity.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nSince there are four such particles and energy is conserved, the total final energy ($E_f$) is:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Î³\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\nNow, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Velocity\n\nThe final step is to calculate the velocity ($v$) from the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n\nThe formula for $\\gamma$ is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe rearrange this to solve for $v/c$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light (c).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
