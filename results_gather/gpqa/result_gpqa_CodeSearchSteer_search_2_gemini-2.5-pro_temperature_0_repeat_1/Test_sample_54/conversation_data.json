    "To identify the unknown organic compound, we must analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it with the structures of the possible options.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons that are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This is characteristic of the methyl group (CH₃) in an acetate functional group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d). This indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This pattern fits a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=) but not a butenyl group (CH₃-CH₂-CH=), which would show more complex splitting for its ethyl fragment. Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (C and D).\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These signals are in the vinyl region, corresponding to the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The key piece of information here is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz for the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n\n### Distinguishing Between Cis and Trans Isomers:\n\nThe geometric arrangement of protons across a double bond significantly affects their coupling constant.\n*   For protons in a **trans** configuration, the coupling constant (³J) is typically in the range of 11-18 Hz.\n*   For protons in a **cis** configuration, the coupling constant (³J) is smaller, generally between 6-15 Hz.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a trans-alkene. This large J value is a definitive indicator of the trans relationship between the two vinyl protons.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  The signals at 2.1 ppm (acetate) and 1.6 ppm (methyl doublet) point towards a propenyl acetate structure.\n2.  The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) for the vinyl protons confirms a trans configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's assign all the peaks to the Trans-propenyl acetate structure:\n*   **H(a)**: CH₃-C=O at 2.1 ppm (singlet)\n*   **H(b)**: CH₃-CH= at 1.6 ppm (doublet, coupled to H(d))\n*   **H(c)**: =CH-O at 7.0 ppm (doublet, coupled to H(d) with J=16.0 Hz)\n*   **H(d)**: CH₃-CH= at 5.5 ppm (doublet of quartets, coupled to H(c) and the CH₃ group H(b))\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
