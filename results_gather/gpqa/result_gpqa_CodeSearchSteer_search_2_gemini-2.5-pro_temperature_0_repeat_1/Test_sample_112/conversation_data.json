    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which typically appears as a very broad band from 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. This broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak is typically observed between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. If the carbonyl group is conjugated with a C=C double bond, this absorption can shift to a slightly lower wavenumber (1680-1715 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group. These peaks typically appear in the 4.6-5.9 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion from 1H NMR:** This confirms the FTIR data, indicating the molecule contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** In the mass spectrum of a carboxylic acid, a common fragmentation pattern is the cleavage of the bond next to the carbonyl group, which can result in a [COOH]⁺ fragment. The mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of this fragment is 45. This provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Molecular Formulas\n\nTo have both a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C), a molecule must contain:\n*   At least two oxygen atoms.\n*   At least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond).\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** 1 oxygen atom. Degrees of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula lacks the second oxygen required for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** 2 oxygen atoms. Degrees of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct number of oxygens for a carboxylic acid and the correct degrees of unsaturation for one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This is a perfect match for the spectral data.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** 1 oxygen atom. Degrees of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and is missing an oxygen.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** 2 oxygen atoms. Degrees of Unsaturation = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. While it has two oxygens, it only has one degree of unsaturation, which would account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond but not the additional C=C bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The combined spectral evidence points unambiguously to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only molecular formula that fits all the data—the presence of two oxygens, and two degrees of unsaturation—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
