    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to establish the mass dimensions of the fields and the Lagrangian density in 4-dimensional spacetime.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimensions of Fields and Lagrangian:**\n    *   In natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action S is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density L over spacetime: S = ∫d⁴x L.\n    *   The spacetime differential d⁴x has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴.\n    *   For the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴.\n    *   The mass dimension of a fermion field ψ in 4D is [M]^(3/2).\n    *   The field strength tensor F<sup>μν</sup> is derived from the gauge field A<sup>μ</sup> (F<sup>μν</sup> = ∂<sup>μ</sup>A<sup>ν</sup> - ∂<sup>ν</sup>A<sup>μ</sup>). The gauge field A<sup>μ</sup> has a mass dimension of [M]¹, and the derivative ∂<sup>μ</sup> also has a mass dimension of [M]¹. Therefore, the mass dimension of F<sup>μν</sup> is [M]².\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of κ:**\n    The interaction Lagrangian is given by:\n    L<sub>int</sub> = κψ̄σ<sub>μν</sub>ψF<sup>μν</sup>\n\n    The mass dimension of the entire term must be 4. The term σ<sub>μν</sub> is composed of gamma matrices and is dimensionless. We can now write the dimensional equation:\n    [L<sub>int</sub>] = [κ] [ψ̄] [ψ] [F<sup>μν</sup>]\n    [M]⁴ = [κ] * [M]^(3/2) * [M]^(3/2) * [M]²\n    [M]⁴ = [κ] * [M]³ * [M]²\n    [M]⁴ = [κ] * [M]⁵\n    [κ] = [M]⁴ / [M]⁵\n    [κ] = [M]⁻¹\n\n    So, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n3.  **Renormalizability of the Theory:**\n    A key criterion for determining the renormalizability of a quantum field theory is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n    *   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant is positive, the interaction is \"super-renormalizable\".\n    *   If the mass dimension is zero, the interaction is \"renormalizable\".\n    *   If the mass dimension is negative, the interaction is \"non-renormalizable\".\n\n    Since the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
