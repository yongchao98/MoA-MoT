    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are interested in the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe problem starts with a stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M [Ca-EDTA]²⁻. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium due to dissociation. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex will be (0.02 - x).\n\nWe can set up the equilibrium expression using the formation constant:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nGiven that K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), the dissociation will be minimal. This means 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex, 0.02 M. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This calculation assumes an ideal pH where the fully deprotonated form of EDTA (Y⁴⁻) is the only one that needs to be considered, as implied by the problem statement.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nC) 2.0x10⁻² M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
