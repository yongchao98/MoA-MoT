    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound**\nThe molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC nomenclature, when a -COOH group is attached to a benzene ring, the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the number 1 position.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\nLet's map out the substituents based on the description:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** C1\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN):** These are \"all meta to one another\" with the carboxylic acid. This indicates a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. So, the -CHO and -CN groups are at positions C3 and C5.\n*   **Methoxy (-OCH₃):** This is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at C4.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂):** These are ortho to the carboxylic acid, meaning they occupy positions C2 and C6.\n*   **Final Placement Constraint:** The methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the cyano group.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. This fits the methoxy group at C4 and requires the hydroxyl group to be at C2.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. This fits the methoxy group at C4 and requires the hydroxyl group to be at C6.\n\n**3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Structure**\nWe have two potential structures. To decide which is correct, we must apply the IUPAC rule for numbering when two or more numbering schemes result in the same set of locants (in this case, {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}). The rule states that the lowest locant is assigned to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nThe substituents are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, and **m**ethoxy.\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Cyano at C3):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n    *   In this structure, the first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano,\" is at position **3**.\n\n*   **Structure 2 (Cyano at C5):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   In this structure, the first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano,\" is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, IUPAC rules dictate that Structure 1 is the correct one.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct structure (Structure 1), we list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers.\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\" gives the final IUPAC name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
