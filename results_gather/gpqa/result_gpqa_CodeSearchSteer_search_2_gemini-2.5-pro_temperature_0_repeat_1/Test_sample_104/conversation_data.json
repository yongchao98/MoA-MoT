    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the described starspots, we must first calculate the brightness drop caused by the spotted hemisphere.\n\n### 1. Brightness Drop from Starspots\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Teff), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T_eff⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature of T_eff = 6000K, is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by cooler spots (filling factor f = 0.20) and the remaining 80% at the normal effective temperature.\n    *   Effective Temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n    *   Spot Temperature (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average: F_min ∝ (0.80 × T_eff⁴) + (0.20 × T_spot⁴).\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nBy substituting the expressions for flux, we get:\n\nAmplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [0.80 × T_eff⁴ + 0.20 × T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = (0.20 × T_eff⁴ - 0.20 × T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the given temperatures:\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (1 - 625/1296)\nAmplitude = 0.20 × (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\n### 2. Equivalent Exoplanet Transit\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star causes a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit is approximately equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This can be expressed as the square of the ratio of their radii (R_pl / R_star).\n\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that mimics the starspot signal, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\n### 3. Solving for the Relative Radius\n\nFinally, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root of the amplitude:\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
