    "The step-by-step synthesis is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n    Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The reaction introduces a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the benzene ring, forming nitrobenzene (Product 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n    Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron powder (Fe). The iron acts as a catalyst. The nitro group is a deactivating and meta-directing group in electrophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the position meta (position 3) to the nitro group. This reaction forms 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n    Product 2 (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene) is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that selectively reduces the nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂) without affecting the bromo-substituent. The resulting compound is 3-bromoaniline (Product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Diazotization**\n    Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF₄). This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The product is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4).\n\n*   **Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Arylation**\n    Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) is heated and then treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). Heating the diazonium salt generates a 3-bromophenyl radical. This is characteristic of a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which is an aryl-aryl coupling reaction involving a diazonium salt. The methoxy group (-OCH₃) on anisole is an ortho-, para-directing group for electrophilic (and radical) substitution. The 3-bromophenyl radical will preferentially attack the para-position of anisole due to less steric hindrance. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the two aromatic rings, resulting in a biphenyl derivative. The final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl (Product 5).\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n*   A) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect bromine position.\n*   B) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect methoxy and bromine positions.\n*   C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Correct.\n*   D) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect, this would imply a Schiemann reaction occurred without the addition of anisole.\n\n<<<C>>>"
