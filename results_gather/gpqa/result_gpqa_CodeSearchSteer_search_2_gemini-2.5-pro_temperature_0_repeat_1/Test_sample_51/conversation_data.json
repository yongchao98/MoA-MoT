    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to apply this equation.\n\nThe ratio (R) of the populations of an upper energy level (n₂) to a lower energy level (n₁) is given by:\n\nR = n₂ / n₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the two levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots, which corresponds to a decrease in temperature. Our formula is consistent with this observation: as T decreases, the exponential term, and thus the ratio R, also decreases.\n\nWe need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This factor is the ratio of R at the \"no spots\" temperature (T_nospots) to R at the \"spots\" temperature (T_spots).\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\nFactor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out, and we can simplify the expression using the properties of exponents:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy difference (ΔE) from the given wavelength (λ) of the transition, which is 1448 Å (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m).\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\nWhere:\n*   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n\nΔE ≈ (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nNow, we can calculate the term ΔE/k, where k (Boltzmann constant) is ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nΔE/k ≈ (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99420 K\n\nNext, we use the given temperatures:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nNow, we can calculate the exponent in our factor equation:\n\nExponent = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)\nExponent ≈ 99420 K * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K)\nExponent ≈ 99420 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) )\nExponent ≈ 99420 * ( 500 / 33,000,000 )\nExponent ≈ 99420 / 66000\nExponent ≈ 1.506\n\nFinally, we calculate the factor:\n\nFactor = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
