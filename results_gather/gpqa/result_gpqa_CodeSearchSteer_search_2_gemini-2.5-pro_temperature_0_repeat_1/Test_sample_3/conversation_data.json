    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations would be different to account for magnetic charges and magnetic currents.\n\nThe standard form of Maxwell's equations in a vacuum is based on the experimental observation that there are no isolated magnetic poles. The existence of a magnetic monopole would introduce a \"magnetic charge density\" and a \"magnetic current density\".\n\nThis would lead to the following changes:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: This law, which describes the divergence of the magnetic field, is normally written as ∇ · **B** = 0. This mathematical statement is equivalent to saying there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles existed, this equation would be modified to include a term for the magnetic charge density (ρm), becoming ∇ · **B** = ρm.\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction**: This law describes the circulation (or curl) of the electric field. In its standard form, it states that a changing magnetic field creates an electric field (∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a moving magnetic charge would constitute a magnetic current (Jm). This magnetic current would also create an electric field, modifying the equation to ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - Jm.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
