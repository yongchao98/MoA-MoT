    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Analysis of the Mean Free Path\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The formula is given by:\n\n**λ = 1 / (n * σ)**\n\n*   **n:** The number density of gas molecules in the sample compartment. This value remains constant in both scenarios as the temperature, pressure, and volume of the compartment do not change.\n*   **σ:** The collision cross-section, which represents the effective area in which a collision can occur. This is the key variable that differs between the two scenarios.\n\n### Scenario 1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1)\n\nIn the first case, λ1 represents the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n\n*   **Collision Type:** Gas molecule – Gas molecule.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1):** When two spherical molecules of the same radius (r) collide, the collision cross-section is the area of a circle with a radius equal to the sum of their radii (r + r = 2r). Therefore, the cross-section is σ1 = π(2r)² = 4πr².\n*   **Formula for λ1:** λ1 = 1 / (n * 4πr²)\n\n### Scenario 2: Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2)\n\nIn the second case, λ2 represents the mean free path of electrons from the beam as they scatter off the residual gas molecules.\n\n*   **Collision Type:** Electron – Gas molecule.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** An electron's physical radius is negligible compared to the radius of a gas molecule. Therefore, the collision is akin to a point-like particle (the electron) hitting a spherical target (the gas molecule). The effective cross-section is simply the area of the gas molecule itself.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** σ2 ≈ πr²\n*   **Formula for λ2:** λ2 = 1 / (n * πr²)\n\n### Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nNow, we can compare the two mean free paths:\n\n*   λ1 = 1 / (n * 4πr²)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n * πr²)\n\nBy comparing the two expressions, we can see that the denominator for λ1 is four times larger than the denominator for λ2. This means that λ2 is four times larger than λ1.\n\n**λ2 ≈ 4 * λ1**\n\nSince λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, this leads to the conclusion that λ2 > λ1. Reviewing the given options, the only one that fits this physical reality is that λ2 is greater than λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
