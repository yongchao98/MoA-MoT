    "To solve this problem, a thorough analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential compounds is necessary. The key information from the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture is the presence of two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (around 2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Analysis of Each Compound's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will result in a single singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce a single singlet in the alkyl region, integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This will lead to two distinct singlets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in three different chemical environments: the methyl at C2 is unique, the methyl at C5 is unique, and the methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent. This results in three singlets in the alkyl region with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, producing a single singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H), and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair (a second signal, 6H). This gives two singlets in the alkyl region with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, resulting in one singlet integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signal from the -CH2- groups will be a quartet, and the signal from the -CH3- groups will be a triplet. The problem states all signals in the alkyl region are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options:\n\nThe observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture has two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One from 1,2,3,4- (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5- (1H each). This would result in three signals, which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for its 2 equivalent protons). 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two non-equivalent protons, but the problem states the mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Let's re-examine the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons in different environments, leading to two singlets. If mixed with 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has one aromatic singlet, we would expect three aromatic signals in total. However, it is possible that two of these signals overlap. A more likely interpretation is that one of the compounds in the mixture has no aromatic protons. But all listed compounds are C10H14 and are tetramethylbenzenes, so they must have two aromatic protons. Let's reconsider the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) and three sets of methyl protons (C1/C3, C2, C5). This compound alone gives two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets. If we have a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n        *   **Aromatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in three signals. This contradicts the data. There must be an error in my initial analysis or the problem description. Let's re-evaluate the number of signals for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons and four methyl groups. Due to its structure, it has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (giving two singlets) and three sets of chemically non-equivalent methyl groups (a 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyls, and two 3H singlets for the other two unique methyls), which gives a 2:1:1 ratio. The spectrum described in the problem (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets) perfectly matches the spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, assuming the two aromatic protons have nearly identical integration. The question, however, specifies a 1:1 mixture. Let's assume there is an overlap of signals in the mixture.\n    *   Let's reconsider the combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-. This is three signals.\n    *   Let's reconsider the combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-. This gives two singlets. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the integrals would be 2H to 2H, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the aromatic region data.\n        *   Alkyl signals: 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, we would have three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio). This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
