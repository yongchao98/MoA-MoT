  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "An analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the reason for the failed protein expression.\n\nThe sequence begins with `ATG`, the correct start codon for Methionine. This is followed by the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`, which correctly codes for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag's amino acid sequence (YPYDVPDYA).\n\nHowever, examining the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence is crucial. The sequence continues:\n\n`...GATTACGCC` **`AAA`** **`TGA`** `...`\n\nWhen this is translated in the correct reading frame:\n*   **GCC** codes for Alanine (the last amino acid of the HA tag).\n*   **AAA** codes for Lysine.\n*   **TGA** is a stop codon.\n\nThe presence of this `TGA` codon immediately after the tag sequence acts as a premature termination signal for the ribosome. This causes translation to halt, resulting in the production of a very short, non-functional peptide (Met-HA-Lys) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein.\n\nTherefore, the other options are incorrect:\n*   B) The lack of a linker is a design choice, but it does not inherently cause a complete failure of expression; the premature stop codon does.\n*   C) The sequence for the HA tag itself is correct.\n*   D) The stop codon in question is TGA, not UAA, and the absence of a tRNA for a stop codon is what allows translation to terminate, which is the normal biological mechanism.\n\nThe correct explanation is the early termination of translation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
