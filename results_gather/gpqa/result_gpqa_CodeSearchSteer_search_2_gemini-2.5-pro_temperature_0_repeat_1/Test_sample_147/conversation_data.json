    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2:**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can determine the identity of Y by testing plausible chemical formulas (YFₙ) against this percentage.\n\n    *   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × Molar Mass of F) / (Molar Mass of Y + n × Molar Mass of F)\n    *   Let's test the formula SbF₃ (Antimony trifluoride).\n        *   Molar Mass of Sb ≈ 121.76 g/mol\n        *   Molar Mass of F ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n        *   ɷF in SbF₃ = (3 × 18.998) / (121.76 + 3 × 18.998) = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    *   This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This strong correlation suggests that **Element Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **Substance A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Possible Binary Compounds of Antimony:**\n    Antimony primarily forms two stable binary fluorides:\n    *   **Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**\n    *   **Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**\n\n3.  **Determine Substance A4 by its Molecular Weight:**\n    The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls. A4 is one of the binary compounds of antimony and fluorine. Let's calculate the molecular weights of the two main candidates:\n\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF₃:** 121.76 + (3 × 18.998) = **178.75 g/mol**.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF₅:** 121.76 + (5 × 18.998) = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n    Now, let's compare these molecular weights to the given ranges:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 140-160\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.75 g/mol) fits perfectly within range **A) 160-180**. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.75 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on A4:**\n    Based on the numerical evidence, substance A4 must be SbF₃. The other descriptive clues in the problem (the color of A1, the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) contain inconsistencies with standard chemical properties but are not needed to solve for the molecular weight of A4. The mass percentage of A2 and the provided molecular weight ranges are sufficient to identify A4.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is approximately 179 g/mol, which falls into the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<A>>>"
