    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$. They depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic field was generated by the charge. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n\nGiven the notation in the problem:\n*   $q$ is the point charge.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nThe scalar potential $V(\\vec{r},t)$ is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nSimilarly, this can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions for $V(\\vec{r},t)$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ directly match the ones provided in option B. It is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\nComparing with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrectly uses the static Coulomb potential and an incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$.\n*   B) Correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials in the given notation.\n*   C) Incorrectly uses a plus sign in the denominator.\n*   D) Incorrectly uses the static Coulomb potential, although the relationship between $\\vec{A}$ and $V$ is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
