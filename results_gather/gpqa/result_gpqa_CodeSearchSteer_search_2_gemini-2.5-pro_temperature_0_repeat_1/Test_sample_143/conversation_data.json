    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n**1. Understand the concepts**\n\n*   **Decay Width (Γ):** This is a measure of the uncertainty in the energy of an unstable particle, related to its lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It is given in units of energy (MeV in this case).\n*   **Mean Lifetime (τ):** This is the average time a particle exists in its own rest frame before decaying. The relationship between decay width and mean lifetime is given by the formula: τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** In special relativity, this factor describes how time, length, and relativistic mass change for a moving object. It is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (mc²).\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the average distance a particle travels in the laboratory frame before decaying. Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer (γτ), and the distance it travels is L = v * (γτ), where v is the particle's velocity. This can be conveniently expressed as L = γβcτ, where β = v/c.\n\n**2. List the given values and constants**\n\n*   Total energy of X, E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass of X, m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Decay width of X, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   A useful combination is ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n\n**3. Perform the calculation**\n\nThe calculation can be done in a single, combined formula for the mean decay distance L:\n\nL = γβ * c * τ\n\nFirst, let's find the terms γβ and τ.\n\n*   **Calculate the mean lifetime (τ):**\n    τ = ħ / Γ_X\n    τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\n    τ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n*   **Calculate the term γβ:**\n    The Lorentz factor is γ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.67.\n    The relativistic velocity factor β can be found from γ using β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n    β = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887.\n    So, γβ ≈ (20/3) * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.\n\n    A more direct way to find γβ is using the relativistic momentum (p): E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    (pc)² = E_X² - m_X² = (8000 MeV)² - (1200 MeV)² = 64,000,000 - 1,440,000 = 62,560,000 MeV²\n    pc = √62,560,000 ≈ 7909.5 MeV.\n    The relation γβ = pc / mc² gives:\n    γβ = 7909.5 MeV / 1200 MeV ≈ 6.591\n\n*   **Calculate the mean decay distance (L):**\n    L = γβ * c * τ\n    L ≈ 6.591 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    L ≈ 4.066 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n**Alternative calculation using ħc:**\n\nA more precise method combines the steps, using the value of ħc:\nL = (pc / m_X) * τ = (pc / m_X) * (ħ / Γ_X) = (pc / (m_X * c²)) * (ħc / Γ_X)\nL = (√[E_X² - m_X²] / m_X) * (ħc / Γ_X)\nL = (√[8000² - 1200²] / 1200) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nL = (√62,560,000 / 1200) * (0.61656 fm)\nL = (7909.5 / 1200) * 0.61656 fm\nL ≈ 6.591 * 0.61656 fm\nL ≈ 4.064 fm\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n**4. Compare with the options**\n\n*   A) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n*   B) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n*   C) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n*   D) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n\nOur calculated value of ~4.065 x 10⁻¹⁵ m matches option C. The minor difference between the calculated value and the option is due to the precision of the physical constants used.\n\n<<<C>>>"
