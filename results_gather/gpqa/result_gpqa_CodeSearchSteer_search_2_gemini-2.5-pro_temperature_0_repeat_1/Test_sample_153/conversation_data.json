    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at **m/z = 156**. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at **m/z = 158** (the M+2 peak) with an intensity that is 32% of the M+ peak. This ~3:1 ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is a definitive indicator of the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule, due to the natural isotopic abundance of ³⁵Cl (75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (24.2%).\n    *   All the proposed options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak is observed in the range of **3500-2700 cm⁻¹**. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak appears at **1720 cm⁻¹**. This frequency is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This makes options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates. Phenyl chloroformate (A) would lack the broad O-H peak, and its C=O peak would be at a higher frequency. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C) would have an O-H peak, but typically less broad than a carboxylic acid, and an aldehyde C=O peak.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in only two types of aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly more shielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Inconsistent with IR (no broad O-H) and NMR (would not have a para-substitution pattern or a peak at 11.0 ppm).\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring containing a carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom. It perfectly matches all the spectral data:\n    *   **MS:** Correct molecular weight and isotopic pattern for chlorine.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid, matching the broad O-H and C=O peaks.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton (~11-13 ppm) and the characteristic two-doublet pattern for a para-substituted ring in the aromatic region.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Inconsistent with NMR. It would have three distinct aromatic protons with a more complex splitting pattern and an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm, not a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Inconsistent with the NMR spectrum. As a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) compound, it lacks symmetry and would show four distinct, complex signals in the aromatic region, not two doublets of 2H each.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral data—the chlorine isotope pattern in the mass spectrum, the carboxylic acid signals in the IR spectrum, and the specific para-substitution pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum—unambiguously point to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
