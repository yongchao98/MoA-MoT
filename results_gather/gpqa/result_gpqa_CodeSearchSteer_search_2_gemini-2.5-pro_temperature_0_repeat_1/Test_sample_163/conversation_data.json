    "The search results confirm the formula and the reasoning. Specifically, result states, \"In an eclipsing binary, then the shape and depth of the eclipses can be uniquely solved to give the inclination and hence the masses of the individual stars.\" It also provides the mass function which relates the masses to the period and radial velocity. The key is that for eclipsing binaries, the inclination `i` is known to be close to 90 degrees, which makes sin(i) close to 1.\n\nThe formula for the total mass (M1 + M2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is:\nM1 + M2 = [P / (2πG)] * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)\n\nSince both systems are eclipsing, we can assume sin³(i) ≈ 1 for both.\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system 1 to system 2 is:\nMass_Ratio = (M_total1) / (M_total2)\nMass_Ratio = { [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / (2πG) } / { [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³] / (2πG) }\nMass_Ratio = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2) ]³\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nMass_Ratio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\nMass_Ratio = 2 * (3/5)³\nMass_Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nMass_Ratio = 54 / 125\nMass_Ratio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nThe question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The result of 0.432 means that system 1 is *less* massive than system 2. The wording of the question might be slightly tricky, but the factor is the calculated ratio.\n\nLet's re-read the question: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\". This is asking for the ratio M1/M2. My calculation is correct. The factor is ~0.4.\n\nThe options are:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nMy calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n2 * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (0.6)^3 = 2 * 0.216 = 0.432. The calculation is correct.\nThe physics principles applied are correct for the given scenario (double-lined, eclipsing binaries).\nThe assumption that sin(i) is approximately 1 is justified because the systems are eclipsing.\nThe final answer is robust.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (M₁ + M₂) can be determined using the orbital period (P), the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The formula is:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that the inclination of the orbits (i) is close to 90 degrees. When i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\nLet's denote the total mass of system_1 as M_sys1 and the total mass of system_2 as M_sys2.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sys1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\nM_sys1 ≈ [P₁ * (K_sys1)³] / (2πG)\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sys2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nM_sys2 ≈ [P₂ * (K_sys2)³] / (2πG)\n\nNow, we can find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 by calculating the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2:\n\nFactor = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = { [P₁ * (K_sys1)³] / (2πG) } / { [P₂ * (K_sys2)³] / (2πG) }\n\nThe term (2πG) cancels out, leaving:\n\nFactor = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_sys1 / K_sys2)³\n\nNow, we plug in the values for the periods and the sums of the velocity amplitudes. We can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s since we are calculating a ratio.\n\n*   P₁ / P₂ = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   K_sys1 / K_sys2 = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nFactor = 2 * (0.6)³\nFactor = 2 * 0.216\nFactor = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.4. This means that system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that exhibits eclipses, we can calculate the total mass using the following relationship derived from Kepler's third law:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   M₁ and M₂ are the masses of the two stars.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the sky.\n\nSince both systems are described as having eclipses, their orbital inclination `i` must be close to 90°. For an inclination of 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass equation for both systems.\n\nLet's calculate the total mass for each system in terms of the constant (2πG).\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   Total mass (M_sys1) ∝ P₁ * (K_total1)³\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   Total mass (M_sys2) ∝ P₂ * (K_total2)³\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2:\n\nFactor = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K_total1)³] / [P₂ * (K_total2)³]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFactor = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\nFactor = 2 * (3/5)³\nFactor = 2 * (27 / 125)\nFactor = 54 / 125\nFactor = 0.432\n\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.432. This indicates that system_1 is actually less massive than system_2.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.2\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
