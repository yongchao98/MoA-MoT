    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), incorporating higher-dimensional operators to describe the effects of new physics at energy scales beyond the electroweak scale. The construction of these operators relies on certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n**1. Lorentz Symmetry:** The SMEFT is built upon the principles of quantum field theory and special relativity. A core assumption is that the underlying physics is described by a manifestly Poincaré-invariant local quantum theory, which inherently includes Lorentz invariance. The operators in the SMEFT are constructed from the Standard Model fields in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry.\n\n**2. Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry encompasses both Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. It is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity and a foundational assumption in the construction of the SMEFT. The SMEFT Lagrangian is required to be invariant under the Poincaré group.\n\n**3. CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry, the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations, is known to be violated in the Standard Model. The SMEFT framework allows for additional sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the SM. In fact, studying potential new CP-violating operators is a significant area of research within SMEFT. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n**4. CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any Lorentz-invariant local quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT symmetric. Since the SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Any violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance, which contradicts the foundational assumptions of SMEFT.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
