    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the minimum energy of the system:\n\n**1. Understanding the System and the Problem**\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles, each with a positive charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`1.602 x 10^-19` C).\n*   One particle is fixed at a point P, which we can consider the origin of our coordinate system.\n*   The other 12 particles are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2` m, centered at P.\nThe problem asks for the *minimum energy* of this system. The total electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges. For the total energy to be at a minimum, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion. This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem.\n\n**2. The Thomson Problem and the Icosahedron**\n\nFor 12 point charges on the surface of a sphere, the configuration that minimizes the electrostatic potential energy is one where the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in the sphere. An icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 triangular faces.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Electrostatic Potential Energy**\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of two components:\n1.  `U_sphere`: The potential energy of the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere interacting with each other.\n2.  `U_interaction`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**4. Calculating the Interaction Energy (`U_interaction`)**\n\nThe central charge (`q_center = 2e`) is at a distance `R = 2` m from each of the 12 charges on the sphere (`q_sphere = 2e`). The potential energy of interaction for each sphere charge with the central charge is:\n\n`U_single_interaction = k * (q_center * q_sphere) / R`\n\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant (`8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`).\n\nSince there are 12 such charges, the total interaction energy is:\n\n`U_interaction = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e) / R) = 12 * (4 * k * e² / R) = 48 * k * e² / R`\n\nGiven `R = 2` m:\n\n`U_interaction = 48 * k * e² / 2 = 24 * k * e²`\n\n**5. Calculating the Sphere Energy (`U_sphere`)**\n\nTo calculate the potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere, we need the distances between all pairs of vertices of the icosahedron. For any given vertex of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R:\n*   There are 5 adjacent vertices at a distance `a` (the edge length of the icosahedron).\n*   There are 5 other vertices at a distance of `aφ`, where `φ` is the golden ratio (`(1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618`).\n*   There is 1 antipodal vertex at a distance of `2R` (the diameter of the sphere).\n\nThe total number of pairs is `(12 * 11) / 2 = 66`. These pairs are distributed as:\n*   30 pairs at distance `a`.\n*   30 pairs at distance `aφ`.\n*   6 pairs at distance `2R`.\n\nThe edge length `a` of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R` is given by the formula:\n`a = 2R / sqrt(1 + φ²)`\n\nThe total potential energy of the sphere charges is the sum of the energies of all these pairs:\n\n`U_sphere = k * (2e)² * [30/a + 30/(aφ) + 6/(2R)]`\n`U_sphere = 4 * k * e² * [ (30/a) * (1 + 1/φ) + 3/R ]`\n\nUsing the property `1 + 1/φ = φ`:\n\n`U_sphere = 4 * k * e² * [ 30φ/a + 3/R ]`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `a`:\n\n`U_sphere = 4 * k * e² * [ (30φ / (2R/sqrt(1+φ²))) + 3/R ]`\n`U_sphere = (4 * k * e² / R) * [ 15φ * sqrt(1+φ²) + 3 ]`\n\n**6. Combining and Simplifying the Total Energy**\n\n`U_total = U_sphere + U_interaction`\n`U_total = ( (4 * k * e² / R) * [ 15φ * sqrt(1+φ²) + 3 ] ) + ( 48 * k * e² / R )`\n`U_total = (4 * k * e² / R) * [ 15φ * sqrt(1+φ²) + 3 + 12 ]`\n`U_total = (4 * k * e² / R) * [ 15φ * sqrt(1+φ²) + 15 ]`\n\nA known mathematical identity for the golden ratio is `φ * sqrt(1+φ²) = sqrt(5 + 2√5)`. Substituting this and `R=2`:\n\n`U_total = (4 * k * e² / 2) * [ 15 * sqrt(5 + 2√5) + 15 ]`\n`U_total = 2 * k * e² * 15 * [ sqrt(5 + 2√5) + 1 ]`\n`U_total = 30 * k * e² * [ sqrt(5 + 2√5) + 1 ]`\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the physical constants:\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`\n*   `e ≈ 1.602177 x 10^-19 C`\n*   `k * e² ≈ (8.98755 x 10^9) * (1.602177 x 10^-19)² ≈ 2.307077 x 10^-28 J·m`\n\nAnd the mathematical constants:\n*   `√5 ≈ 2.236068`\n*   `sqrt(5 + 2√5) ≈ sqrt(5 + 4.472136) = sqrt(9.472136) ≈ 3.07768`\n\n`U_total = 30 * (2.307077 x 10^-28) * [ 3.07768 + 1 ]`\n`U_total = 30 * (2.307077 x 10^-28) * [ 4.07768 ]`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82216 x 10^-26` J\n\nRounding to three decimal places, we get `2.822 x 10^-26` J.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.056 x 10^-27\nB) 122.330\nC) 5.645 x 10^-26\nD) 2.822 x 10^-26\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
