    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The laboratory frame (let's call it S), where the observer is at rest.\n    *   The moving frame (let's call it S'), which is the glass block. This frame moves with velocity `v` relative to the lab frame S.\n\n2.  **Determine the velocity of light in each frame:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass block relative to the lab is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass (in the S' frame, where the glass is at rest) is given by `u' = c/n`. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula to find the velocity `u` in the lab frame S when the velocities are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
