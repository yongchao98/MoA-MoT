    "The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. This reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN-) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. When using sodium cyanide (NaCN) as the source of the cyanide ion, an acid is required to protonate the intermediate alkoxide ion to form the final hydroxyl group of the cyanohydrin. A hydronium ion (H3O+), typically generated from a strong acid, serves as the necessary proton source for this step. Therefore, reagent A is H3O+.\n\nThe second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The starting material is a cyanohydrin, and the product is an Î±-hydroxy carboxylic acid. This transformation is a standard reaction in organic chemistry, achieved by heating the nitrile with a strong acid or base in the presence of water. The use of a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) with water is a common method for the acidic hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Therefore, reagent B is HCl.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
