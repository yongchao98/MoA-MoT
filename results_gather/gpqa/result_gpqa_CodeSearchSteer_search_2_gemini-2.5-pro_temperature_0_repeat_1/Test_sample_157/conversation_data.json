    "A dominant-negative mutation, also known as an antimorphic mutation, results in a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein when co-expressed. This is particularly common for proteins that function as dimers or multimers.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the scenario:\n\n1.  **The Transcription Factor's Function:** The transcription factor must form a dimer to enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription. This dimerization is mediated by the dimerization domain.\n2.  **Mutation Y:** This is a heterozygous missense mutation in the dimerization domain. It is described as a dominant-negative mutation.\n3.  **The Molecular Interaction:** In a heterozygous individual, both wild-type and mutant protein subunits are produced. The mutant subunit, despite the mutation in the dimerization domain, can still interact and form a dimer with a wild-type subunit. However, this resulting heterodimer (one wild-type subunit + one mutant subunit) is non-functional.\n4.  **The Outcome:** The mutant protein effectively \"poisons\" the wild-type protein by sequestering it into inactive dimers. This significantly reduces the number of functional wild-type/wild-type homodimers, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even though a normal allele is present. This interference with the product of the wild-type allele is the key feature. The non-functional heterodimeric complex may also be unstable and targeted for degradation by the cell's quality control machinery. This would lead to the degradation of both the mutant and the wild-type protein that is trapped in the complex.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a mutant phenotype, not a wild-type one. If the mutation prevented dimerization altogether, it would likely be a recessive loss-of-function, not dominant-negative.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While some mutations cause aggregation, the specific mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation is interference with the wild-type protein, which is a more precise description than general aggregation.\n*   **C) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation causes a loss of function.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely molecular phenotype. The mutant protein's interference renders the wild-type protein in the dimer non-functional, which is a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\" The resulting abnormal protein complex is a likely target for cellular protein degradation pathways. This option best describes the \"poison pill\" mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
