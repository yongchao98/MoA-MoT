    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation using the provided information.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on its distance from the host star (the semi-major axis, 'a'). Specifically, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (T_eq ∝ 1/√a).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 is:\n\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)**\n\nTo find this ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nThe problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by each planet, which allows us to find the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) induced by each planet. The Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the radial velocity (v_r) by the formula Δλ/λ = v_r/c, where λ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light. The maximum shift corresponds to the radial velocity amplitude, K.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude (K) for a star in a circular orbit due to a planet is given by:\n\n**K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)**\n\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n\n**a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)**\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1:\n\n**a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (K2² * M_star) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (K1² * M_star) ]**\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\n**a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²**\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 / K2). Since K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ), the ratio is:\n\n*   K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nNext, we use the given masses of the planets:\n\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\nNow, we can substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\n*   a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n*   a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n*   a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Final Temperature Ratio\n\nFinally, we substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our initial temperature ratio equation:\n\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1) = √(225 / 784)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
