    "The problem asks for the joint probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements. The steps to solve this are well-established in quantum mechanics.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the initial state vector.**\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\nTo be a valid quantum state, the vector must be normalized. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is obtained by dividing `|ψ⟩` by its norm, `√6`:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n\n**Step 2: Find the eigenvector of operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.**\nThe first measurement is of the observable P, and the desired outcome is the eigenvalue 0. The matrix for P is:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|p₀⟩` that satisfies `P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩`. Let `|p₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\nThis leads to the system of equations:\n1.  `y/√2 = 0` ⇒ `y = 0`\n2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]ᵀ`. We normalize it by setting its length to 1:\n`x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1` ⇒ `2x² = 1` ⇒ `x = 1/√2`\nSo, the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is `|p₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability of measuring P=0.**\nAccording to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n`⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] . (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n`= (1/√12) * [(-1) + 0 + (-1)] = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n`Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the state of the system after the first measurement.**\nWhen a measurement yields a specific eigenvalue, the state of the system \"collapses\" to the corresponding eigenvector. In this case, after measuring P=0, the new state of the system `|ψ'⟩` is the eigenvector `|p₀⟩`:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ`\n\n**Step 5: Find the eigenvector of operator Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1.**\nThe second measurement is of the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The desired outcome is the eigenvalue -1. The matrix for Q is:\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩` for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n`|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]ᵀ`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1.**\nThis probability is calculated on the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`.\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n`⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] . [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ`\n`= 0*(1/√2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the total probability.**\nThe probability of a sequence of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is:\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<A>>>"
