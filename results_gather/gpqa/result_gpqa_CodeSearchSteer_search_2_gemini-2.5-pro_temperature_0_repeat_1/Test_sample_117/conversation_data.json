    "The reaction between an enol and bromine is a classic example of an α-substitution reaction of a carbonyl compound. Enols, which are isomers of ketones or aldehydes, possess a carbon-carbon double bond and are electron-rich, making them reactive towards electrophiles like bromine.\n\nThe mechanism involves the following steps:\n1.  The reactant, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is the enol tautomer of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n2.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks a molecule of bromine (Br₂).\n3.  This electrophilic addition results in the formation of a new carbon-bromine bond at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). In this specific molecule, the double bond is between C1 (bearing the -OH group) and C2. The bromine will add to C2.\n4.  The intermediate then loses a proton from the oxygen atom to regenerate the carbonyl group (a ketone in this case).\n\nThe final product is a ketone with a bromine atom on the alpha-carbon. For 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the reaction yields a ketone at the C1 position and a bromine atom at the C2 position, with the two methyl groups remaining at C4. This corresponds to the structure of 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The other options, (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol and (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, would be the result of a simple addition across the double bond without the characteristic rearrangement of the enol, which is not the major pathway. 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone is incorrect as the reaction occurs at the α-carbon, not the C4 position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
