    "The analysis of the provided spectroscopic data leads to the identification of the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C6H4. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals in the aromatic region, is characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring with two different substituents.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** This corresponds to the four protons on the para-substituted benzene ring, which are split into two distinct signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The description of one doublet and one doublet of quartets is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The two vinyl protons are coupled to each other. One of them is further split by the adjacent methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One methyl signal arises from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The other methyl signal, combined with the ester information from FTIR and the constraint of having no -CH2 groups, points to a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates other possible structures, such as those containing an ethyl ester or an allyl group.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectral data, the molecule consists of:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)\n*   A methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nBy summing the atoms from each fragment, we can determine the overall chemical formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 1 (from the C=O) + 1 (from the -OCH3) + 3 (from the propenyl group) = 11\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 3 (from the -OCH3) + 5 (from the propenyl group) = 12\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This corresponds to a structure such as methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\nComparing this calculated formula with the given options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
