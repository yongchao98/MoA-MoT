    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction series to determine the final product E and its corresponding number of 13C-NMR signals.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\nThis reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (propanal, CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The aldehyde is converted into a cyclic thioacetal, specifically a 1,3-dithiolane.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\nButyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the original carbonyl carbon) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfur atoms. This deprotonation creates a carbanion.\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane anion. This species is a nucleophile.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\nThe nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond, adding an ethyl group to the carbon atom at position 2 of the dithiolane ring.\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\nThis step is the deprotection of the thioacetal. The dithiolane group is hydrolyzed in the presence of mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) and acid, which regenerates the carbonyl group. The carbon that was part of the dithiolane ring, and is bonded to two ethyl groups, becomes the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Product D:** 3-Pentanone (diethyl ketone, CH₃CH₂COCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\nThis is a Wittig reaction. First, a Wittig reagent (an ylide) is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane, using BuLi as the base. Then, this ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone).\n*   **Ylide Formation:**\n    1.  PPh₃ + CH₃CH₂CH(Br)CH₂CH₃ (3-bromopentane) → [PPh₃⁺-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂]Br⁻ (a phosphonium salt).\n    2.  [PPh₃⁺-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂]Br⁻ + BuLi → PPh₃=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ (the Wittig reagent/ylide).\n*   **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone D.\n    *   (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O (D) + PPh₃=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ (E) + PPh₃=O.\n*   **Product E:** The final product is tetraethylethene. Its IUPAC name is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene)**\n\nThe structure of E is:\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n```\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses several symmetry elements, including three perpendicular C₂ axes (a D₂ point group), which makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n1.  All four methyl (-CH₃) carbons are equivalent and will produce a single signal.\n2.  All four methylene (-CH₂) carbons are equivalent and will produce a second, distinct signal.\n3.  The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are equivalent and will produce a third, distinct signal.\n\nTherefore, the 13C-NMR spectrum of the final product E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, will show a total of 3 signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
