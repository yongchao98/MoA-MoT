    "The Mott-Gurney equation is a fundamental model used to describe the current-voltage characteristics of a semiconductor device operating in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The validity of this equation rests on several key assumptions about the device and the charge transport mechanism.\n\nThe equation is derived for a **single-carrier device**, meaning that the current is carried predominantly by either electrons or holes, but not both. Furthermore, the model assumes the semiconductor is an insulator or is intrinsically pure, and is **trap-free**, meaning there are no localized states within the band gap that can immobilize charge carriers. The presence of traps alters the relationship between current and voltage.\n\nA critical requirement for the Mott-Gurney law is the nature of the electrical contacts. The model assumes **Ohmic contacts**, which means there is no energy barrier for the injection of charge carriers from the electrodes into the semiconductor. This condition of \"no carrier injection barrier\" ensures that the current is limited by the buildup of space charge within the device, rather than by the injection process itself. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would violate this assumption.\n\nFinally, the Mott-Gurney equation considers that the dominant charge transport mechanism is **drift**, which is the movement of charge carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution of **diffusion current**, which arises from gradients in the charge carrier concentration, is assumed to be negligible. This assumption is generally valid at sufficiently high applied voltages. The model specifically describes a drift-dominated current, so a negligible drift current would be incorrect.\n\nBased on these conditions, the correct statement is:\n\nD) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.\n\n<<<D>>>"
