    "The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) are due to a process called X-chromosome inactivation. In mammals with more than one X chromosome, the genes on all but one X are largely silenced to ensure a proper gene dosage. This process occurs in individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome, just as it does in typical XX females.\n\nThis epigenetic mechanism, which happens early in embryonic development after fertilization (post-zygote), involves compacting the extra X chromosome into a dense structure called a Barr body. A key part of this process is the methylation of chromatin, a modification carried out by enzymes like histone methyltransferases. These enzymes add methyl groups to the histone proteins that package the DNA, leading to gene silencing across most of the extra X chromosome.\n\nIn contrast, there is no equivalent mechanism to inactivate an entire extra autosome, such as chromosome 21 in Down's syndrome. The presence of a third copy of chromosome 21 leads to the overexpression of many genes, which disrupts normal development and causes the more severe and wide-ranging symptoms associated with Down's syndrome.\n\nWhile X-inactivation silences most genes on the extra X chromosome in Klinefelter's syndrome, some genes do \"escape\" inactivation. The expression of these few genes from the second X chromosome is thought to contribute to the specific features of the syndrome, such as tall stature and infertility.\n\n<<<A>>>"
