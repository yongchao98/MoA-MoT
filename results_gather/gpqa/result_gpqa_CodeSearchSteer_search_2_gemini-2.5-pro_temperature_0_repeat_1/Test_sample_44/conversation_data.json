    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then apply the Pauli exclusion principle for the four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\nThe energy for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), *m* is the mass of the particle, and *ħ* is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E as:\nE = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nTherefore, the energy of the n-th level can be expressed as:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\n### System of Four Spin-1/2 Particles\nThe particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by the quantum numbers *n* (energy level) and *m_s* (spin, which can be +1/2 or -1/2). This implies that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\nFor the ground state, the four particles must occupy the lowest possible energy levels.\n*   Two particles will fill the n=1 energy level. Their combined energy is 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles will fill the n=2 energy level. Their combined energy is 2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n### First Excited State Energy\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we need to move one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3). This represents the smallest possible increase in total energy from the ground state.\nThe particle configuration for the first excited state is:\n*   Two particles in the n=1 level, with energy 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E.\n*   One particle in the n=2 level, with energy 1 * E_2 = 1 * (2^2 * E) = 4E.\n*   One particle in the n=3 level, with energy 1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We need to consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n1.  **Move one particle from n=1 to n=3:** The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. This is not possible because the n=2 level is already full. A particle from n=1 would have to go to a level higher than n=2. Let's re-evaluate the configuration: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The total energy would be (1^2*E) + 2*(2^2*E) + (3^2*E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n2.  **Move two particles from n=2 to n=3:** The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3. The total energy would be 2*(1^2*E) + 2*(3^2*E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  **Move one particle from n=2 to n=4:** The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The total energy would be 2*(1^2*E) + 1*(2^2*E) + 1*(4^2*E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
