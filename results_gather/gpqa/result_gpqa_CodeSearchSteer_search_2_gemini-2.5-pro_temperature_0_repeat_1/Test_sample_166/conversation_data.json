    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Define the State**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\nwhere N is the normalization constant:\nN = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) * exp(-2α²))\n\nWe are asked to calculate the non-Gaussianity for φ = -π/4 and α = 0.5.\n\nFirst, let's substitute φ = -π/4 into the equations:\n*   cos(-π/4) = 1/√2\n*   sin(-π/4) = -1/√2\n*   sin(2 * -π/4) = sin(-π/2) = -1\n\nNow, we find the normalization constant N:\nN = sqrt(1 - exp(-2α²))\n\nSubstituting these into the state vector |ψ⟩, we get:\n|ψ⟩ = ( (1/√2)|α⟩ - (1/√2)|-α⟩ ) / sqrt(1 - exp(-2α²))\n|ψ⟩ = ( |α⟩ - |-α⟩ ) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-2α²)))\n\nThis specific state is known as the \"odd cat state\".\n\n**2. Define the Non-Gaussianity Measure**\n\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity (nG), denoted as δ\\_b, is given by:\nδ\\_b = S(ρ || τ) = trace(ρ ln ρ) - trace(ρ ln τ)\n\nThe problem statement provides a slightly different formula: `del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]`. This is actually the difference in von Neumann entropies, `S(τ) - S(ρ)`. For a pure state `ρ`, its von Neumann entropy `S(ρ) = -trace(ρ ln ρ) = 0`. The reference Gaussian state `τ` is chosen to have the same first and second moments as `ρ`. The standard definition of non-Gaussianity as the relative entropy between `ρ` and `τ` is `nG = S(τ) - S(ρ)`. Since our state `ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|` is a pure state, its entropy `S(ρ)` is 0.\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `τ`:\nnG = δ\\_b = S(τ)\n\n**3. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference Gaussian State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `τ` is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, ν:\nS(τ) = (ν + 1/2) * ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2) * ln(ν - 1/2)\n\nTo find ν, we need to calculate the second moments of our cat state `ρ`. The reference state `τ` will have the same moments. For the odd cat state, the first moment (displacement) is zero. The relevant second moments are the average photon number `<n>` and the squeezing term `<a²>`.\n\nThe moments for the odd cat state are:\n*   `<n>` = α² * coth(α²)\n*   `<a²>` = α²\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue ν can be calculated from these moments using the formula:\nν = sqrt( (α² * coth(α²) + 1/2)² - (α²)² )\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation for α = 0.5**\n\nNow, we substitute α = 0.5 into the equations:\n*   α² = (0.5)² = 0.25\n\nNext, we calculate coth(α²) = coth(0.25):\n*   coth(0.25) = (e^(0.25) + e^(-0.25)) / (e^(0.25) - e^(-0.25)) ≈ 1.0314 / 0.2526 ≈ 4.0831\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of ν:\n*   ν = sqrt( (0.25 * 4.0831 + 1/2)² - (0.25)² )\n*   ν = sqrt( (1.020775 + 0.5)² - 0.0625 )\n*   ν = sqrt( (1.520775)² - 0.0625 )\n*   ν = sqrt( 2.31275 - 0.0625 )\n*   ν = sqrt( 2.25025 ) ≈ 1.5\n\n**5. Calculate the Non-Gaussianity (nG)**\n\nWith ν = 1.5, we can now calculate the entropy S(τ), which gives us the non-Gaussianity:\n*   nG = S(τ) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)\n*   nG = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)\n*   Since ln(1) = 0:\n*   nG = 2 * ln(2)\n*   Using ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\n*   nG ≈ 2 * 0.693 = 1.386\n\nThis value is very close to 1.38.\n\n<<<B>>>"
