    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate is a classic Michael donor. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the acidic α-carbon located between the two ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic and will be attacked by the nucleophile.\n3.  **Reaction:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation of the resulting enolate intermediate yields the final product.\n4.  **Product A:** The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The resulting structure is (MeOOC)₂CH–CH(p-tolyl)–CH₂(COOMe). Systematically naming this structure leads to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles in Michael additions, a reaction known as the Stork enamine synthesis. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the original ketone, which is C2 of the cyclohexene ring.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the site of nucleophilic attack.\n3.  **Reaction:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This is followed by hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), which converts the intermediate iminium ion back into a ketone.\n4.  **Product B:** The overall process results in the addition of a butanenitrile group to the α-carbon of cyclohexanone. The final product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analysis (Retrosynthesis):** This is a Michael addition where the product and one of the reactants (the Michael acceptor) are known. We need to identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), is a classic Michael acceptor.\n3.  **Product Analysis:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The \"3-oxobutyl\" group (-CH₂CH₂COCH₃) is the fragment that comes from the MVK after the addition.\n4.  **Michael Donor (C):** This 3-oxobutyl group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring system. This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The proton on the carbon between the two carbonyl groups (C2) is very acidic and is readily removed by a base like KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
