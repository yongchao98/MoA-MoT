    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the distance to the destination.**\nThe destination is Earth, and the starting point is the Large Magellanic Cloud. The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n**2. Calculate the travel time from Earth's frame of reference.**\nThe spacecraft travels at a constant speed of 0.99999987 *c*. From Earth's perspective, the time (t) it takes to travel is the distance divided by the speed:\n*   t = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 *c*\n*   t ≈ 163,000.0208 years\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor is used to calculate the effect of time dilation. The formula is:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven the velocity (v) is 0.99999987 *c*:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987*c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\n*   γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n**4. Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut.**\nThe time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, t') is the time measured on Earth divided by the Lorentz factor:\n*   t' = t / γ\n*   t' ≈ 163,000.0208 years / 1961.16\n*   t' ≈ 83.11 years\n\n**5. Determine if the astronaut survives the journey.**\nThe astronaut is 22 years old and has a lifespan of 150 solar years, meaning they have 128 years of life remaining (150 - 22). Since the journey will take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's perspective, they will be about 105 years old (22 + 83.11) upon arrival. This is well within their lifespan.\n\nComparing the calculated time of approximately 83 years to the given options:\nA) 72 years\nB) 81 years\nC) 77 years\nD) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n\nThe calculated time of roughly 83 years is closest to 81 years. The minor discrepancy can be attributed to slight variations in the exact distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and rounding during calculations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
