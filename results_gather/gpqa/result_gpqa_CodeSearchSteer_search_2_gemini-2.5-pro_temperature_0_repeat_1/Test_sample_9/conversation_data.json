    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we must analyze the properties of each option.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This planet, by definition, has the same average density as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is about the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will experience stronger gravitational compression. This force squeezes the planet's material, causing it to become more dense. Therefore, a planet with 5 times the mass of Earth but the same raw materials will be significantly denser than Earth. Models of super-Earths show that a 5-Earth-mass planet with an Earth-like composition would have a higher density due to this compression.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will have weaker gravity and therefore less gravitational compression. This results in a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) will have a density significantly greater than 5.51 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n*   Planet (d) will have a density less than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\nTherefore, the planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
