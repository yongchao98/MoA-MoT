    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which is in excess after neutralization.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions:**\n    *   Total moles of H+ come from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH). For the purpose of neutralization with a strong base, we consider all available protons.\n        Total H+ = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH = 0.08 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.13 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions for each formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻).\n        Total OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n3.  **Determine the excess reactant:**\n    The neutralization reaction will consume the limiting reactant.\n    *   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = 0.18 mol\n    *   Total moles of acid (H⁺) = 0.13 mol\n    *   Since the moles of OH⁻ are greater than the moles of H⁺, the base is in excess.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total OH⁻ - Total H⁺ = 0.18 mol - 0.13 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻:**\n    The pH of the final solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base.\n    *   First, find the total volume of the mixed solution:\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Next, calculate the molarity of the excess OH⁻ ions:\n        [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   The pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration.\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   The pH and pOH are related by the equation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final solution is basic, with a pH of 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
