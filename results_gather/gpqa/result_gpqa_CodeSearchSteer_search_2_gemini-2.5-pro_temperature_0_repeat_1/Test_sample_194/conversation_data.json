    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet.\n\n1.  **Define the Transit Impact Parameter:** The impact parameter (*b*) is the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center during transit, normalized by the star's radius. For a circular orbit, it is given by the formula:\n    *b = (a * cos(i)) / Rₛ*\n    where *a* is the semi-major axis, *i* is the orbital inclination, and *Rₛ* is the stellar radius.\n\n2.  **Use Planet 1's Data:** We are given that for the first planet, the impact parameter *b₁* is 0.2. Since both planets share the same orbital plane, the inclination *i* is the same for both. We can express the constant term *cos(i)/Rₛ* in terms of Planet 1's known parameters:\n    *cos(i) / Rₛ = b₁ / a₁ = 0.2 / a₁*\n\n3.  **Condition for Transit/Occultation of Planet 2:** For the second planet to exhibit a transit or an occultation, its closest projected distance to the star's center must be less than or equal to the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius (*Rₛ + Rₚ₂*). The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis (*a₂*), which occurs at the grazing limit:\n    *a₂ * cos(i) = Rₛ + Rₚ₂*\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** We can now substitute the expression for *cos(i)* from Planet 1's data into the equation for Planet 2:\n    *a₂ * (0.2 * Rₛ / a₁) = Rₛ + Rₚ₂*\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Rearranging the equation gives the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    *a₂ / a₁ = (Rₛ + Rₚ₂) / (0.2 * Rₛ) = (1 / 0.2) * (1 + Rₚ₂ / Rₛ)*\n    *a₂ / a₁ = 5 * (1 + Rₚ₂ / Rₛ)*\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (*a*). This can be written as a ratio:\n    *(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁ )³*\n    Therefore, *P₂ = P₁ * (a₂ / a₁)¹·⁵*\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:** For an approximate answer, it is common in such problems to consider the planet's radius negligible compared to the star's radius (*Rₚ₂ << Rₛ*). This simplifies the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    *a₂ / a₁ ≈ 5*\n    Now, we can calculate the maximum period for Planet 2:\n    *P₂ ≈ P₁ * (5)¹·⁵*\n    *P₂ ≈ 3 days * 11.18*\n    *P₂ ≈ 33.54 days*\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days. A more precise calculation that includes the planet's radius yields a result of approximately 34.2 days, but given the options, the approximation is the intended method. The Sun's radius is about 109 times that of Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
