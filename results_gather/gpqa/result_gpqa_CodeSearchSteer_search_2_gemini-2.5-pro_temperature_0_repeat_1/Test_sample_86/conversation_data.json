    "### Analysis of the Compound\n\n1.  **Molecular Composition**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring and a total of 8 carbon atoms. The aromatic ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents.\n2.  **Functional Groups**: FTIR data confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n3.  **Plausible Structure**: A structure that fits all these criteria is a halo-acetophenone. This consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The total carbon count is 6 (from the ring) + 2 (from the acetyl group) = 8 carbons. The substitution pattern is likely *para*, as this often results in a simpler, more distinct NMR spectrum, which is common in such problems. The proposed structure is therefore *p*-halo-acetophenone.\n\n### Predicted ¹H NMR Spectrum for *p*-Halo-acetophenone\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons**: In a *para*-substituted ring, the four protons are divided into two chemically equivalent sets. This arrangement typically produces two doublets in the aromatic region of the spectrum (around 7.0-8.5 ppm), with each doublet integrating to 2 protons. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are expected to be further downfield (higher ppm) compared to those adjacent to the halogen.\n*   **Methyl Protons**: The methyl group (-CH₃) of the acetyl substituent is adjacent to a carbonyl group with no protons, so it will appear as a singlet. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). The shifts are too low. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. The signal at 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2 protons, which does not match the 3-proton singlet expected for a methyl ketone. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is a perfect match for the predicted spectrum of *p*-halo-acetophenone.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a *para*-substituted aromatic ring. For example, the ¹H NMR spectrum for 4'-Chloroacetophenone shows doublets at approximately 7.91 ppm and 7.45 ppm. Similarly, 4'-Bromoacetophenone shows signals around 7.83 ppm and 7.61 ppm. The values in the option are consistent with these examples.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is the singlet for the 3 protons of the methyl group. The chemical shift for the methyl protons in acetophenone and its halogenated derivatives is around 2.6 ppm, so 2.3 ppm is a reasonable value.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals and their integrations do not correspond to any plausible structure derived from the initial information. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the ¹H NMR data in option C accurately represents the described compound, which is identified as a *p*-halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
