    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: To find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L1) and Star_2 (L2), we can set up the following equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which states that the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n    λ_max = b / T  =>  T = b / λ_max\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = (b / λ_rest₁) / (b / λ_rest₂) = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n    Here, λ_rest is the intrinsic peak wavelength of the star in its own reference frame.\n\n5.  **Doppler Shift**: The problem states that the *appeared* (observed) peak wavelengths are the same. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect. The non-relativistic formula for the Doppler shift of light is:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Applying Doppler Shift to the Stars**:\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity (v₁) is 0 km/s. Therefore, its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs₁) is equal to its rest-frame peak wavelength (λ_rest₁).\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity (v₂) is 700 km/s. Its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs₂) is given by λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Connecting the Wavelengths**: Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂), we have:\n    λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n8.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio**: Now we can substitute this back into our temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n9.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 2.\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + (700,000 m/s) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s))⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 / 1.00936\n    L1 / L2 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
