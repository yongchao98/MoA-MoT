    "The final product is identified through a three-step analysis:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material:**\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, which has five degrees of unsaturation, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring. The 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is coupled to a neighboring methylene (-CH2-) group, resulting in a triplet.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region strongly suggests a primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to the aldehyde's CH group, causing the splitting.\n\nBased on this data, the starting compound is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence:**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2 (NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O):** This is a standard two-step procedure for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine followed by hydrolysis. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) upon reaction with water. This transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HOC₆H₄CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Step 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This step involves an aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), making it susceptible to a self-condensation reaction in the presence of a strong base like KOH.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde forms an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option D).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in the formation of a double bond that is conjugated with both the aromatic ring and the aldehyde's carbonyl group, creating a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product of this condensation is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The application of heat ensures that the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
