    "Magnons, phonons, and pions are all examples of Goldstone bosons (or, in the case of pions, pseudo-Goldstone bosons), which are a direct consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry.\n\n*   **A) Magnon:** A magnon is the quasiparticle representation of a spin wave. In a ferromagnet, the ground state has all spins aligned in a particular direction, spontaneously breaking the rotational symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian. The magnon is the Goldstone boson associated with this broken symmetry.\n\n*   **C) Phonon:** A phonon is a quantized mode of vibration occurring in a rigid crystal lattice. The regular, ordered arrangement of atoms in a crystal breaks the continuous translational and rotational symmetry of free space. The phonon is the Goldstone boson that arises from this spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n*   **D) Pion:** In the theory of the strong nuclear force (quantum chromodynamics), the pion is identified as the pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The symmetry is only approximate, which is why the pion has a small mass.\n\n*   **B) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like excitation in a continuous field. While skyrmions can arise in a phase of matter where a symmetry is spontaneously broken (for instance, in certain magnetic materials), the skyrmion itself is a topological soliton, not a Goldstone boson. Its stability is due to its topological properties, which prevent it from easily decaying. A crystal formed of skyrmions can have its own Goldstone modes associated with the breaking of translational symmetry, but the individual skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not directly the Goldstone boson associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
