    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines. The maximum shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K)\n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength shift and the star's velocity is given by the Doppler effect. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum observed wavelength shifts:\n\n*   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n$K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4$\n\n### 3. The Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude (K) of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n\n$K = (2\\pi G / T)^{1/3} * (M_p \\sin(i) / M_{star}^{2/3})$\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Apply the Given Information\n\nThe problem provides the following crucial pieces of information:\n*   The stars have identical masses: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n*   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, this typically refers to the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin(i)$), which is the quantity that can be directly constrained by the measurement. This is a key assumption for solving the problem. Therefore, we assume $M_{p1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx M_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nLet's set up a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n\n$K_2 / K_1 = [(2\\pi G / T_2)^{1/3} * (M_{p2} \\sin(i_2) / M_{star2}^{2/3})] / [(2\\pi G / T_1)^{1/3} * (M_{p1} \\sin(i_1) / M_{star1}^{2/3})]$\n\nGiven our assumptions that the stellar masses and the minimum planet masses are equal, most terms cancel out:\n\n$K_2 / K_1 = (1 / T_2^{1/3}) / (1 / T_1^{1/3}) = (T_1 / T_2)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the known value of $K_2 / K_1$:\n\n$1.4 = (T_1 / T_2)^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods ($T_2 / T_1$), we first solve for $T_1 / T_2$ by cubing both sides of the equation:\n\n$1.4^3 = T_1 / T_2$\n$2.744 = T_1 / T_2$\n\nFinally, we invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n\n$T_2 / T_1 = 1 / 2.744 \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
