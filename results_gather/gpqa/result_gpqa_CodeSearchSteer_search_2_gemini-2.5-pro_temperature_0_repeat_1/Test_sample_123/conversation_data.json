    "To solve this problem, we will use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation as it applies to particle decay.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics of Particle Decay\n\nThe number of particles, N, that survive after a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is described by the exponential decay law:\nN(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / T_lab)\n\nHere, T_lab is the average lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame. According to the theory of special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ). This phenomenon is called time dilation and is given by the formula:\nT_lab = γ * τ\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe time 't' it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall is the distance (the radius R) divided by their velocity (v). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c.\nt ≈ R / c\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector:\nN/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = e^(-R / (γcτ))\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the First Scenario\n\nIn the first scenario, we are given:\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁): 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀): 1/3\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n1/3 = e^(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n\nTo solve for the unknown constant part of the exponent, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\nln(3) = 30 / (20 * cτ)\n\nThis equation relates the physical properties of the particle (its proper lifetime τ) and the detector setup.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Second Scenario\n\nIn the second scenario, we want to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that results in a different survival fraction:\n*   Target fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀): 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂): ?\n*   Detector radius (R): 30 m\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n2/3 = e^(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1.  ln(3) = 30 / (20 * cτ)\n2.  ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\nWe can solve this system by creating a ratio of the two equations to eliminate the common term `30 / (cτ)`:\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = [30 / (20 * cτ)] / [30 / (γ₂ * cτ)]\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1/20) / (1/γ₂)\n(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = γ₂ / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
