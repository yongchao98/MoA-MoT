    "Following the reaction sequence:\n*   **Compound A (C3H6)** is identified as **propene** (CH₃-CH=CH₂), as it undergoes an addition reaction with bromine.\n*   Propene reacts with bromine (Br₂) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) to form **Compound B**, which is **1,2-dibromopropane** (CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂(Br)).\n*   Compound B undergoes dehydrohalogenation upon reaction with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH) to form **Compound C**, which is **propyne** (CH₃-C≡CH).\n*   When propyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes cyclic polymerization (trimerization) to form **Compound D**, which is **1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene)**.\n*   Compound D (mesitylene) is nitrated using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid to yield **Compound E**, **2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene**.\n*   Compound E is reduced using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl) to form **Compound F**, which is **2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine)**.\n*   Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (NaNO₂/HCl) at low temperatures in a diazotization reaction to form **Compound G**, the **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**.\n*   Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide (and warming) to form **Compound H**, which is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are well-known intermediates in the production of dyes. Specifically, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is used as a precursor for various dyes. This statement is correct.\n\n**B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct color change to violet, blue, green, or red-brown upon the formation of a ferric phenoxide complex. A yellow color is generally the color of the ferric chloride solution itself and indicates that the characteristic reaction has not occurred or is atypical. Therefore, stating it gives a yellow color is inconsistent with a standard positive test for phenols. This statement is incorrect.\n\n**C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, all three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, and all nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This results in two distinct signals. Since neither set of protons has adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n**D) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne. Propyne has a boiling point of -23.2°C and is a colorless, highly flammable gas at room temperature and standard pressure. This statement is correct.\n\nThe incorrect statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
