    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle and arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Clues\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is an extremely close match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance X and its Properties:**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since B is D₂O, the heavy isotope is deuterium (D).\n    *   Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its deuterated analog, Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits this description perfectly.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms. This supports the identification of X as a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Reaction:**\n    *   The clues describe the reaction: **X + Y → W (gas) + G (precipitate)**.\n    *   We have hypothesized that **X is LiAlD₄**. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water and other protic compounds.\n    *   The gas **W** has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine potential gas molecules:\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   Helium-4 (He): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Fits, but unlikely product.\n        *   Nitrogen-14 (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Fits, but unlikely product.\n    *   For D₂ gas to be produced, LiAlD₄ must react with a deuterium source. Let's assume liquid **Y is D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   The reaction would be: **LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂**\n    *   This reaction produces **gas W = D₂**, which matches the clue.\n    *   It also produces a precipitate. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a precipitate. Its deuterated analog, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**. This fits.\n\n4.  **Confirming the Final Clue:**\n    *   The final clue states that heating the precipitate G releases B.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose. The thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O).\n    *   Therefore, heating aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would produce alumina (Al₂O₃) and heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: **2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O**\n    *   This means the released substance is D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This confirms our deductions.\n\n### Summary of Identified Substances:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O)\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂)\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O)\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), considering that the masses of all instances of these elements must be summed.\n\n1.  **Identify elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, the lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the formula unit:**\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium (²H or D) isotope. The mass number of deuterium is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element = 1 × 27 = 27\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
