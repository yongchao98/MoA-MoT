    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The energy absorbed is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star (r). The energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the planet's temperature (T⁴), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nFor a planet in radiative equilibrium, the power absorbed equals the power radiated. This leads to the relationship:\n\nT_eq⁴ ∝ 1/r²\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/r²)^(1/4) = 1/√r\n\nSince the problem states the planets have circular orbits, the distance 'r' is the semi-major axis 'a'. Therefore, the relationship between the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (T_A and T_B) and their semi-major axes (a_A and a_B) is:\n\nT_A / T_B = √(a_B / a_A)\n\nFor Planet_4 and Planet_2, this becomes:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₄) = (a₄ / a₂)^(-1/2)\n\n**2. Relationship between Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n\n(P_A / P_B)² = (a_A / a_B)³\n\nApplying this to Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\n(P₄ / P₂)² = (a₄ / a₂)³\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we can rearrange this equation:\n\na₄ / a₂ = (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3)\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can determine the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\nP₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\n**4. Combining the Relationships and Calculating the Final Ratio**\n\nNow, we can substitute the ratio of the orbital periods into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na₄ / a₂ = (1.75)^(2/3)\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the equation for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(1.75)^(2/3)]^(-1/2)\n\nBy simplifying the exponents, we get:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1.75)^((2/3) * (-1/2)) = (1.75)^(-1/3)\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = 1 / (1.75)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 1 / 1.205 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.83\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated ratio of approximately 0.83 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
