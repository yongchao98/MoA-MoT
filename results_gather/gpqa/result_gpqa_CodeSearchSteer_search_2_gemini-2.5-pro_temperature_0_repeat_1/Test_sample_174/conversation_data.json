    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined symmetry axis like a spheroid, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, assuming its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. The power radiated by such a dipole is not uniform in all directions.\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ) / λ⁴\n\nwhere:\n*   **θ** is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n*   **λ** is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nFrom this relationship, we can determine both parts of the question.\n\n1.  **Fraction of Maximum Power (A) at θ = 30°:**\n    *   The radiated power is a function of the angle θ, specifically `sin²(θ)`.\n    *   The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). So, `A` is proportional to `sin²(90°) = 1² = 1`.\n    *   At an angle of `θ = 30°`, the power radiated is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n    *   Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, the power at this angle is proportional to `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at 30° is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power: (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n2.  **Possible Form of the Function f:**\n    *   The function `f` represents the radiated power per unit solid angle, which depends on both wavelength (λ) and angle (θ).\n    *   As shown in the formula, the radiated power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation, a phenomenon also responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n    *   Therefore, a possible form for the function `f` includes the term `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of maximum power radiated at 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of the function `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
