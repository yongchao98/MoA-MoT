    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, two main criteria must be met: the star must be visible from both locations, and its brightness must be within the detection limits of both instruments.\n\n**1. Visibility from Both Observatories**\n\n*   The **Paranal Observatory** is in the Southern Hemisphere in Chile (Latitude ~24.6° S).\n*   The **W. M. Keck Observatory** is in the Northern Hemisphere in Hawaii (Latitude ~19.8° N).\n\nFor a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination (DEC) must be within a range accessible from both hemispheres. A star with a declination between approximately -70° and +65° can be observed from both locations.\n\n*   **Star 1 (DEC = -75°):** Too far south to be visible from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Star 2 (DEC = +55°):** Visible from both observatories.\n*   **Star 3 (DEC = +48°):** Visible from both observatories.\n*   **Star 4 (DEC = -48°):** Visible from both observatories.\n*   **Star 5 (DEC = +60°):** Visible from both observatories.\n\nBased on visibility, Star 1 is eliminated.\n\n**2. Brightness Detection Limits**\n\nA star must be bright enough for both spectrographs. The combined requirement is dictated by the stricter limit.\n*   **ESPRESSO limit:** Apparent V magnitude < 17\n*   **HIRES limit:** Apparent V magnitude < 16\n*   **Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (V < 16.0) to be detected by both.**\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5log₁₀(d/10). If there is interstellar dust, an extinction factor (Aᵥ) must also be added.\n\n*   **Star 2:** Has a given apparent V magnitude of 16.5. This is not brighter than 16.0, making it too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Star 3:** Has a given apparent V magnitude of 15.5. This is brighter than 16.0 and is visible from both sites. The information about color excess is not needed as the final apparent magnitude is provided.\n*   **Star 4:** To find the apparent magnitude, we must calculate it from its absolute magnitude (Mᵥ = 15.5), distance (d = 10 pc), and the extinction caused by dust.\n    *   Extinction (Aᵥ) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   Apparent V mag = Mᵥ + 5log₁₀(d/10) + Aᵥ\n    *   Apparent V mag = 15.5 + 5log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This is not brighter than 16.0, making it too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Star 5:** We must calculate its apparent magnitude from its absolute magnitude (Mᵥ = 16.5) and distance (d = 5 pc).\n    *   Apparent V mag = Mᵥ + 5log₁₀(d/10)\n    *   Apparent V mag = 16.5 + 5log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   This is brighter than 16.0 and is visible from both sites.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness requirements for observation with both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<A>>>"
