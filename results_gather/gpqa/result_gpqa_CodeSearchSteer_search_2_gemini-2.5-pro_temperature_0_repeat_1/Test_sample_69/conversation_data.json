    "This is a complex chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown compounds based on their reactions. Let's break down the clues to find the identity of the extremely hazardous product E and its molecular symmetry.\n\n**1. Identifying the Common Reactants (B, D, H, F, G):**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** The reaction of two common gases, B and D, in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) strongly suggests the formation of phosgene. So:\n    *   Gas B is **Chlorine (Cl₂)**.\n    *   Gas D is **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**.\n    *   Solvent H is **Phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product C reacts with water to reform solid A and two acids, F and G.\n    *   Since C is formed from a reaction involving chlorine (B), its hydrolysis will produce a strong acid F, which must be **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**.\n    *   Acid G is described as weak. The hydrolysis of salts or non-metal halides often produces a weak acid alongside a strong one.\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Reaction and Product E:**\n\nThe puzzle's remaining reactions are:\n*   **Reaction 1:** Solid A + 8 Cl₂ (B) → Bright red product C.\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 CO (D) → Extremely hazardous product E.\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A + HCl (F) + G (weak acid).\n\nThe clues, particularly the regeneration of A and the unusual stoichiometry, point to a very specific and somewhat obscure chemical system. While the reaction scheme is difficult to resolve completely without ambiguity, we can deduce the likely identity of E by focusing on Reaction 2 and the nature of hazardous chemical products.\n\nThe reaction `C + 2 CO → E` suggests that E is a carbonyl compound. A plausible, though not definitively proven, candidate for E that fits the description of \"extremely hazardous\" and can be formed from a reaction involving chlorine and carbon monoxide is **Oxalyl Chloride ((COCl)₂)**.\n\n**3. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n\nLet's assume E is Oxalyl Chloride. Its structure is Cl-C(=O)-C(=O)-Cl. This molecule can exist in several conformations. The two most stable are the *trans* and *cis* planar forms. The *cis* conformer, where both C=O bonds and both C-Cl bonds are on the same side of the C-C bond, possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two vertical mirror planes.\n\nThe symmetry elements for cis-Oxalyl Chloride are:\n*   An identity element (E).\n*   A two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that bisects the C-C bond.\n*   Two vertical planes of reflection (σᵥ), one being the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nA molecule with these symmetry elements belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group. This point group is very common for bent or V-shaped molecules like water (H₂O), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and phosgene (COCl₂).\n\nGiven the options, C₂ᵥ is the most chemically plausible symmetry for the hazardous product E.\n\n<<<C>>>"
