    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants\n\n1.  **The Dienophile (Anhydride):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   This strongly suggests maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid) is dehydrated to form **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's verify this with the provided NMR data for the anhydride:\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride has two chemically equivalent protons on the double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these protons appear as a single peak. The chemical shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** Maleic anhydride has two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This results in two distinct peaks. The peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the alkene carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbons.\n    *   The provided spectral data perfectly matches the structure of maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **The Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n### Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products\n\nThe reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction) between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n*   This reaction typically yields two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product** under normal reaction conditions. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable product and is the **minor product**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ for the diene + C₄H₂O₃ for the anhydride).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the *Endo* and *Exo* Products\n\nLet's visualize the two products to understand the spatial relationships between the protons, which is crucial for interpreting the NOESY data.\n\n*   **Protons in the Products:**\n    *   Two bridgehead methyl groups (6H total). Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n    *   Two vinylic methyl groups on the double bond (6H total). Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   Two protons on the succinic anhydride part of the new ring (2H total). Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n\n*   ***Endo* Product (Major):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C=C double bond bridge. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in close spatial proximity to the **Me_vinyl** groups.\n\n*   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is pointing away from the C=C double bond bridge. This places the **H_anhydride** protons far from the **Me_vinyl** groups but close to the **Me_bridgehead** groups.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are spatially near.\n\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but absent or weak in the minor product.\n*   Since the major product is the *endo* isomer, we expect to see a NOE cross-peak resulting from the spatial proximity characteristic of this isomer.\n*   As established in Step 3, in the *endo* isomer, the **H_anhydride** protons are close to the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n*   Therefore, the significant cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum will connect the signals for **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**.\n\n### Step 5: Assign Chemical Shifts and Identify the Correct Option\n\nNow we need to assign the chemical shifts given in the options to the relevant protons.\n\n*   **Me_vinyl (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate around 1.6-1.8 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **H_anhydride (2H singlet):** These protons are on sp³ carbons, but they are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This deshielding effect moves their signal downfield, typically to ~3.5 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Me_bridgehead (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on a saturated carbon bridgehead would be the most shielded, resonating upfield at ~1.0 ppm.\n\nThe cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**. Based on our assignments, this is the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect protons and shifts.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - **This matches our analysis perfectly.**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be a cross-peak between bridgehead and vinyl methyls.\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect protons.\n\nThe cross-peak connecting the vinyl methyl protons (6H at ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H at ~3.5 ppm) is uniquely characteristic of the major *endo* product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
