    "Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, we can determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself.\n\nFirst, let's consider a sphere of radius *d* centered on the observer. If the stars are distributed uniformly, the number of stars (*N*) within this sphere is proportional to its volume. The volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)π*d*³, so the number of stars up to a distance *d* is:\n\n*N* ∝ *d*³\n\nNext, we need to relate the distance to a star to its parallax (*plx*). The parallax is inversely proportional to the distance. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\n*d* = 1/*plx*\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for distance into our equation for the number of stars to express *N* as a function of parallax:\n\n*N* ∝ (1/*plx*)³\n*N* ∝ 1/*plx*³\n\nThe question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to parallax, or d*N*/d(*plx*). To find this, we differentiate the expression for *N* with respect to *plx*.\n\nLet *N* = *k* ⋅ *plx*⁻³, where *k* is a constant of proportionality.\n\nd*N*/d(*plx*) = -3*k* ⋅ *plx*⁻⁴\n\nThe magnitude of this derivative tells us how the density of stars per unit parallax interval changes:\n\n|d*N*/d(*plx*)| ∝ 1/*plx*⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as approximately 1/*plx*⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
