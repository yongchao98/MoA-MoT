    "The analytical data presented—two NMR peaks for a single alpha-proton and two LC-MS peaks of identical mass—strongly indicates the presence of two distinct but isomeric compounds. Let's evaluate the given options to find the most plausible explanation.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They arise when a compound has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration differs at only some, but not all, of these centers. In peptide synthesis, this can happen if one of the amino acid starting materials is not enantiomerically pure or if racemization occurs at an alpha-carbon during the coupling reaction.\n    *   **NMR Spectroscopy:** In a standard achiral solvent, diastereomers are chemically non-equivalent. This means their corresponding protons will exist in slightly different chemical environments and will therefore have different chemical shifts in the 1H NMR spectrum. The observation of two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and a combined integral of one proton, is a classic sign of a diastereomeric mixture.\n    *   **LC-MS Analysis:** Because diastereomers have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like reverse-phase HPLC. The LC-MS data showing two clearly defined peaks with identical mass spectra is consistent with the separation of two diastereomers. The elevated temperature used in the analysis can often improve the resolution between such closely related compounds. The equal intensities suggest the two diastereomers are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Double coupling is a technique used in solid-phase peptide synthesis to ensure a difficult coupling reaction goes to completion. It is a procedural step intended to *increase* the purity of the final product by minimizing deletion sequences. It does not generate a stable, isomeric byproduct and therefore would not result in two distinct peaks in either NMR or LC-MS.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be an incompletely synthesized peptide, meaning it would have a different, lower molecular weight. The LC-MS analysis shows that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the *expected* final product. This observation directly refutes the possibility of contamination with a lower-mass precursor.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   **NMR Spectroscopy:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical spectra. One would only observe a single set of peaks. Resolving them would require the use of a chiral solvent or a chiral derivatizing agent, which was not mentioned.\n    *   **LC-MS Analysis:** Similarly, enantiomers cannot be separated on a standard (achiral) chromatography column; they would co-elute as a single peak. Separation requires a chiral stationary phase or a chiral mobile phase additive. The presence of two distinct peaks in the LC trace makes it highly unlikely that the mixture consists of enantiomers, assuming a standard achiral LC method was used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined evidence from both NMR and LC-MS analyses points unequivocally to the presence of diastereomers. The two species are separable by chromatography and distinguishable by NMR, and they share the same molecular mass, all of which are characteristic properties of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>"
