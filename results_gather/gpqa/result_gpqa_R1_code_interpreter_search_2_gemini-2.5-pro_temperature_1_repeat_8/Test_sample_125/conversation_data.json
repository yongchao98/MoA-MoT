    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let's draw its structure. The numbering starts from the right side to give the ketone the lowest number (3).\n    ```\n        OCH3\n        |\n    CH3-CH-CH2-C-CH2-CH3\n              ||\n              O\n    6   5    4   3  2   1\n    ```\n    The chiral center is at carbon 5 (C5). The configuration is given as (S).\n\n2.  **Reagent and Reaction:** The reagent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol group (-CHOH).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Product(s):**\n    *   The original chiral center at C5, (S)-5-methoxy, is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The reduction of the planar ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H-) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This non-stereospecific attack on the achiral ketone center will produce both possible configurations at C3, i.e., (R) and (S).\n    *   Therefore, the products are a mixture of two compounds:\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of multiple chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    ```\n      O        O\n      ||       ||\n    CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3\n    1   2  3   4  5\n    ```\n    This molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry passing through C3.\n\n2.  **Reagent and Reaction:** The reagent is excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. \"Excess\" implies that both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to secondary alcohol groups. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Product(s):**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's examine the (2R, 4S) structure. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, it has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This makes it an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction produces three stereoisomers:\n        *   A racemic pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   One meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, for a total of **five different stereoisomers**:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol } Diastereomers\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol }\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol } Enantiomers\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol }\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol  } Meso compound (diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair)\n\nNow, let's predict the number of peaks in each HPLC experiment.\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation):**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus **cannot** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have different properties and elute separately. This gives another **1 peak**.\n    4.  The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2, one ether, one alcohol) are structurally distinct and have different molecular weights and polarities compared to the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2, two alcohols). Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will not co-elute with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation):**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n*   It can separate **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   We simply need to count the total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   As determined above, there are five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n*   Assuming the chiral column is effective, it will resolve all five compounds.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
