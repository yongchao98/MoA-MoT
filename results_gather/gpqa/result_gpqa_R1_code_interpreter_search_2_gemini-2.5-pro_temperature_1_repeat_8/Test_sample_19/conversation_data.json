    "This question asks for the assumptions that constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe impulse approximation simplifies a complex interaction with a multi-particle nucleus by treating it as a much simpler interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. The \"impulse\" refers to the idea that the interaction happens over a very short time scale, so the nucleon that is struck doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the binding potential of the nucleus.\n\nLet's analyze each statement in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is the fundamental starting point of the impulse approximation. We are simplifying a many-body problem to a one-body problem. If the interaction could involve multiple nucleons at once (e.g., through meson-exchange currents), the approximation of a single, isolated interaction would fail. Therefore, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This deals with what happens *before* and *after* the primary interaction. If the projectile (e.g., an electron) or the ejected nucleon re-scatters off other nucleons (known as final-state interactions or FSI), the picture is no longer simple. The assumption of a \"transparent\" nucleus is the most basic form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA). It ensures that we are only seeing the result of the single, primary interaction, just as we would with a free nucleon in empty space. Thus, this assumption is essential to the simplest form of the approximation.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is about how the nucleon behaves within the *nucleus*, not about its internal composition. Whether the quarks are relativistic or not is a separate question addressed by models of the nucleon's structure (like the quark model or QCD). The impulse approximation can be used with both relativistic and non-relativistic descriptions of the nucleon itself. Therefore, this is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very core of the \"impulse\" idea. A nucleon in a nucleus is bound by the strong force from its neighbors. A free nucleon is not. The approximation assumes that the energy and momentum transferred during the interaction are so large and happen so quickly that the binding forces are negligible *at the moment of interaction*. The nucleon is essentially \"knocked out\" before the rest of the nucleus can react. This is a crucial assumption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. They ensure that the interaction is treated as a clean, one-on-one event with a single nucleon, which behaves as if it were free and isolated from the rest of the nucleus during the interaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
