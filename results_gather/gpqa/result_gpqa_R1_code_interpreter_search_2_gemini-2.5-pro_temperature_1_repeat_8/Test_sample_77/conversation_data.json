    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **Retarded Potentials:** For time-varying charge and current distributions, the electromagnetic potentials at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are not determined by the source distributions at time $t$, but at an earlier time called the **retarded time**, $t_r$. The delay, $t - t_r$, accounts for the finite speed of light, $c$. The general formulas for these retarded potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be represented using Dirac delta functions:\n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integrals:** We substitute these densities into the potential integrals. The key challenge is that the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$.\n    Let's use the notation from the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: the distance from the charge's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n    The retarded time condition becomes $t_r = t - d/c$.\n\n    The evaluation of the integrals with the delta function is a standard but non-trivial procedure in electromagnetism. The result of the integration is:\n    $\\int \\frac{f(\\vec{r}') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{f(\\vec{r}')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}} \\right]_{\\vec{r}'=\\vec{s}(t_r)}$\n\n    The factor $(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})$ in the denominator arises from the fact that the volume of integration appears different due to the motion of the source.\n\n    Applying this to our potential integrals:\n    *   For the scalar potential V, $f(\\vec{r}') = q$.\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    *   For the vector potential A, $f(\\vec{r}') = q\\vec{v}$.\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** Let's simplify the denominator:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{cd}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Now, substitute this simplified denominator back into the expressions for V and A:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{\\left(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\left(\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match option D exactly.\n\n    *   Option A and B use the static potential form, which is incorrect for a moving charge where retardation effects are important.\n    *   Option C has the wrong sign in the denominator ($+$ instead of $-$). The negative sign is crucial; it shows that the potential is stronger if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n    *   Option D matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. It also correctly uses $\\mu_o$ for the permeability of free space.\n\nAdditionally, we can check the relationship between V and A.\n$\\vec{A} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, this becomes $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. The expressions in option D satisfy this relationship.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
