    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are part of a conjugated system or attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride. A peak around 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C). The presence of only two peaks indicates a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest structure that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons), which matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n    *Structure of Maleic Anhydride:*\n    ```\n      O=C--CH=CH--C=O\n         \\      /\n           O\n    ```\n\n*   **The Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene) with two conjugated double bonds (at positions 1,3).\n    *   Methyl groups are attached to all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n    *   The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n    *Structure of the Diene:*\n    ```\n          C5H₂\n         /    \\\n    C4(Me)=C3(Me)\n      |      |\n    C1(Me)--C2(Me)\n    ```\n    (Note: The double bonds are between C1=C2 and C3=C4, with a single bond between C2-C3, forming a conjugated system C1=C2-C3=C4. The C1 and C4 carbons are linked by the C5H₂ bridge).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and the products.**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   **The Products:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   The **endo adduct** is typically the kinetically favored product, formed faster at lower temperatures. It is usually the **major product**.\n    *   The **exo adduct** is typically the thermodynamically more stable product (due to less steric hindrance). It is usually the **minor product**.\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is **1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride**. The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry and spatial relationships in the *endo* and *exo* products.**\n\nLet's visualize the two isomers. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework has a C7-CH₂ bridge. The anhydride is fused to C2 and C3. The double bond is between C5 and C6. Methyl groups are at C1, C4, C5, and C6.\n\n*   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the protons on C2 and C3 (let's call them H_anhydride) very close to the *anti*-proton of the C7 bridge (the proton pointing away from the C5=C6 double bond). The H_anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups on C5 and C6.\n\n*   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. In this arrangement, the H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. Instead, they are now close to the vinylic methyl groups on C5 and C6.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the NOESY NMR data.**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** (*endo*) but **absent or weak in the minor product** (*exo*).\n*   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Based on our analysis in Step 3, the key interaction is between the **H_anhydride protons (on C2, C3)** and one of the **C7-CH₂ bridge protons**. This interaction is strong in the *endo* isomer and very weak or absent in the *exo* isomer.\n*   Conversely, the interaction between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl groups (on C5, C6)** would be strong in the *exo* isomer but absent in the *endo* isomer.\n\n**Step 5: Assign NMR signals and evaluate the options.**\n\nLet's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the product:\n*   **H_anhydride (on C2, C3):** These two protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **2H singlet**. Being alpha to carbonyl groups, their chemical shift will be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **C7-CH₂ protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent) and geminally coupled. They will appear as two separate signals, each a **1H doublet**. Their chemical shift is typically in the range of **~1-2 ppm**. The question specifies one of them is a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls (on C1, C4):** Two equivalent methyl groups. This will be a **6H singlet**, likely around **~1 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyls (on C5, C6):** Two equivalent methyl groups. This will be a **6H singlet**, at a slightly higher shift than the other methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on the finding that the specific NOE in the major (*endo*) product is between H_anhydride and a C7 proton:\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is a cross-peak between the two sets of methyl groups. They are too far apart for a significant NOE in either isomer.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is between a bridgehead methyl group and a C7 proton. They are relatively close in both isomers, so this NOE would not be unique to the major product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is between the vinylic methyl groups and the H_anhydride protons. This NOE would be strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product. This contradicts the problem statement.\n*   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is between one of the C7 bridge protons and the H_anhydride protons. As determined in Step 4, this interaction is strong and specific to the *endo* (major) product. This perfectly matches all the information given.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the resonance for the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the resonance for one of the C7 bridge protons (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>"
