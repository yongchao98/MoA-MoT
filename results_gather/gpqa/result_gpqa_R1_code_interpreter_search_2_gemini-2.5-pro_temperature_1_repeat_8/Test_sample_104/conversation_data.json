    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would cause the same brightness dip as a rotating star with a spotted hemisphere.\n\n2.  **Model the Spotted Star's Brightness Variation:**\n    *   The star's brightness varies as it rotates, showing us either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted one.\n    *   The maximum flux (`F_max`) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature of `Teff`.\n    *   The minimum flux (`F_min`) occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a spot filling factor of `f_spots = 0.20`. This means that when we view this face, 20% of the visible disk's area is covered by cooler spots (`Tspot`), and the remaining 80% is the normal photosphere (`Teff`).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot-Induced Variation:**\n    *   The flux from a radiating surface is proportional to its area and the fourth power of its temperature (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ A * T⁴). We are interested in the relative change, so we can ignore constants of proportionality.\n    *   Let the area of the star's visible disk be `A_disk`.\n    *   `F_max` is proportional to `A_disk * Teff⁴`.\n    *   `F_min` is proportional to the sum of fluxes from the spotted and unspotted parts of the visible disk: `( (1 - f_spots) * A_disk * Teff⁴ ) + ( f_spots * A_disk * Tspot⁴ )`.\n    *   The amplitude of the variation is the relative drop in flux: `Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux and simplifying by canceling `A_disk`:\n        `Amplitude_spots = ( Teff⁴ - [ (1 - f_spots) * Teff⁴ + f_spots * Tspot⁴ ] ) / Teff⁴`\n        `Amplitude_spots = ( Teff⁴ - Teff⁴ + f_spots * Teff⁴ - f_spots * Tspot⁴ ) / Teff⁴`\n        `Amplitude_spots = f_spots * ( Teff⁴ - Tspot⁴ ) / Teff⁴`\n        `Amplitude_spots = f_spots * ( 1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴ )`\n\n4.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   An exoplanet transit causes a dip in the star's brightness by blocking a portion of its light.\n    *   The amplitude of this dip (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²) = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n5.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the amplitudes must be the same: `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`.\n    *   Therefore, `(Rpl / Rstar)² = f_spots * ( 1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴ )`.\n    *   We can now solve for the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar` by taking the square root of both sides.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Given values:\n        *   `f_spots` = 0.20\n        *   `Teff` = 6000 K\n        *   `Tspot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Plug the values into the equation:\n        `(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.20 * ( 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ )`\n        `(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.20 * ( 1 - (5/6)⁴ )`\n    *   Now, we'll use a Python script to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters based on the problem description\nf_spots = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nTeff = 6000.0   # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nTspot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots\n# Amplitude = f_spots * (1 - (Tspot/Teff)^4)\namplitude_spots = f_spots * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of an exoplanet transit is given by (Rpl/Rstar)^2.\n# We set the two amplitudes to be equal to find the equivalent planet size.\n# (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = amplitude_spots\n\n# Solve for the relative radius (Rpl/Rstar)\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(Rpl_over_Rstar)\n```",
    "The code has executed successfully and calculated the value of `Rpl/Rstar` to be approximately 0.3218.\n\nThis value is the result of the calculation we derived:\n\n1.  **Amplitude from spots:** `Amplitude_spots = f_spots * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n    *   `Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n    *   `Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.10355`\n\n2.  **Amplitude from planet:** `Amplitude_planet = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n3.  **Equating them:** `(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.10355`\n\n4.  **Solving for `Rpl/Rstar`:** `Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
