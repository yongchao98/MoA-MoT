    "To determine if a compound is optically active, we need to check if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion within the molecule. If a compound's name specifies a single enantiomer (e.g., using R/S descriptors), it is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This is an alkene. All the atoms connected by the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them can lie in a single plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name provides specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS) for two stereocenters and (E) for the configuration of the double bond.\n    *   This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   Such a complex and unsymmetrical structure is almost certainly chiral. It is not a meso compound.\n    *   Since it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry. The molecule has the general structure `X-CH(Y)-CH(Y)-X`. When the stereochemistry is (R,S) or (S,R), there is a possibility of it being a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   Let's visualize this with a Fischer projection. The meso isomer has the two COOH groups on top and bottom, and the H and CH3 groups on opposite sides, creating a plane of symmetry. This corresponds to the (R,S) configuration.\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n        H ---|--- CH3  (S)\n               |\n      CH3 ---|--- H    (R)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   The stereochemistry is (R,R). Its mirror image would be (S,S). The (R,R) and (S,S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (C2-C3), and the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (C6-C5-C4). These two paths around the ring are different.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane. There are two diastereomers: one where all OH groups are cis to each other, and one where two are cis and one is trans.\n    *   The all-cis isomer is highly symmetric. It possesses multiple planes of symmetry and is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral in this isomer, meaning they are not true stereocenters, and R/S labels cannot be assigned to them.\n    *   The cis,trans isomer is not symmetric. It lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, so it is chiral. In this isomer, C1, C3, and C5 are all true stereocenters.\n    *   The IUPAC name (1s,3s,5s) assigns an absolute configuration to each of the centers C1, C3, and C5. This is only possible if these are true stereocenters. This means the name must refer to the chiral diastereomer.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is a cyclopentyl ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an isobutyl group: `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters (a carbon with four different single-bonded groups).\n    *   There are no stereocenters in the isobutyl chain: `-CH2-` and `-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   There are no stereocenters in the unsubstituted cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a chiral axis or plane. It is possible to find a conformation of this molecule that has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 4 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
