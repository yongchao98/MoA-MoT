    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe problem involves relativistic speeds, so we cannot simply subtract the velocities. We must use the Lorentz velocity addition formula. The relative velocity of astronaut 2 with respect to astronaut 1 ($v_{21}$) is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{-0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} \\approx -0.142857c$\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. The negative sign indicates that from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving backward, which is expected since astronaut 1 is faster.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2$\n\n**Calculate Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Calculate $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Calculate $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Calculate $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Calculate $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = 1.1547 \\times (3m) \\times c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n*   $E_{total} = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding the results to two decimal places, we get:\n*   $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option D is the correct choice.\n\nTo confirm with higher precision:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv1 = 0.6  # in units of c\nv2 = 0.5  # in units of c\nm1_factor = 2  # in units of m\nm2_factor = 3  # in units of m\n\n# 1.
