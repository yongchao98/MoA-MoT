    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n- It is a tri-substituted benzene ring.\n- The substituents are:\n    - C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    - C2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n    - C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n- The substitution pattern is 1,2,3 (three adjacent groups).\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n- **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n- **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder ortho-substitution.\n- **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Devise a Retrosynthetic Strategy**\n\nWorking backward from the product can help identify a logical synthesis pathway.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is most likely introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This is a common and high-yield reaction.\n    *   Target: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n    *   Precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n    *   Reaction: Deprotonation with a base (like NaOH) followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This matches `vii) NaOH/EtBr` in option C.\n\n*   **Step Before Final:** The phenol group (-OH) is often formed from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   Target: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n    *   Precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**\n    *   Reaction: i) Diazotization with `NaNO2/HCl`. ii) Hydrolysis with `H3O+, H2O/Heat`. This matches `v) NaNO2/HCl` and `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat` in option C.\n\n*   **Step Before That:** We need to synthesize 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. This aniline has three substituents. Let's consider how to introduce them. A plausible route would be to start with a disubstituted aniline and add the third group.\n    *   Target: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline\n    *   Precursor: **2-tert-butylaniline**\n    *   Reaction: Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This matches `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` in option C.\n    *   **Regiochemistry Check:** In 2-tert-butylaniline, the amine is at C1 and the t-Bu is at C2. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-Bu group is an ortho, para-director.\n        *   -NH3+ (at C1) directs to C3 and C5.\n        *   -tBu (at C2) directs to C4 and C6.\n        *   The nitration is complex, but substitution at C3 (meta to -NH3+) is a possibility, although likely not the major product (C4 or C5 are often favored). However, for the synthesis to proceed to the target, this specific regiochemistry is required.\n\n*   **Initial Steps:** We need to synthesize 2-tert-butylaniline. This can be made from benzene.\n    *   Target: 2-tert-butylaniline\n    *   Precursor: **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the nitro group, e.g., with `Fe/HCl`. This matches `iii) Fe/HCl` in option C.\n\n    *   Target: 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene\n    *   Precursor: **tert-butylbenzene**\n    *   Reaction: Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This matches `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` in option C.\n    *   **Regiochemistry Check:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene (an o,p-director) gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group. To get the desired 1,2,3-final product, we must proceed with the minor ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). A \"high-yield\" synthesis would avoid this, but among the given choices, this path is required.\n\n    *   Target: tert-butylbenzene\n    *   Precursor: **Benzene**\n    *   Reaction: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This matches `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` in option C.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Strategy**\n\nLet's assemble the plausible (though not perfectly high-yield) sequence and compare it to the options.\n\n**Our Derived Sequence:**\n1.  Benzene + `t-BuCl/AlCl3` -> tert-butylbenzene\n2.  tert-butylbenzene + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor isomer)\n3.  1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + `Fe/HCl` -> 2-tert-butylaniline\n4.  2-tert-butylaniline + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline (required isomer)\n5.  2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + `NaNO2/HCl` -> diazonium salt\n6.  diazonium salt + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n7.  2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\nThis sequence exactly matches the reactions listed in **Option C** from (i) to (vii).\n\n**Analyzing the Other Options:**\n*   **Option A:** This sequence generates a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate (4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid) and ultimately would lead to a 1,3-disubstituted product (3-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene), not the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted product.\n*   **Option B:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii) is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and directing substitution to the meta position. This would lead to the wrong isomer.\n*   **Option D:** Contains an impossible step (iv), attempting to diazotize a molecule without an amino group.\n\n**Conclusion on Option C:**\nThe sequence of reactions i through vii in option C represents a chemically logical, albeit challenging, route to the target molecule. The main difficulties are the low yield of the ortho-isomer in step (ii) and the uncertain regioselectivity of step (iv). However, it is the only option that presents a correct sequence of functional group transformations to achieve the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The final two steps, (viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and (ix) `dilute H2SO4`, are extraneous and appear to be distractors, as the synthesis is complete after step (vii). Among the given choices, C is the only viable pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>"
