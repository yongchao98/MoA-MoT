    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where a bromine atom is at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) is at position C2. All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) are bonded to hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the active species is the amide ion, :NH₂⁻), and liquid ammonia serves as the solvent.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, which involves a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne** (or aryne).\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n        *   **Position C6:** Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is slightly weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this **kinetic isotope effect**, it is easier and faster for the base to remove the proton (H⁺) from C6 than the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. However, both pathways are possible and will occur. This leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  The carbanion's lone pair attacks C1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n        4.  The intermediate formed is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n             \n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes D⁺ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n        2.  The carbanion's lone pair attacks C1, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process.\n        4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n             \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation of the resulting carbanion by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (2-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile :NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The :NH₂⁻ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C6. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the -D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The :NH₂⁻ group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C1. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the -D at C2. According to IUPAC naming conventions (numbering starts from the carbon with the principal functional group, -NH₂), this molecule is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Thus, Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium. The nucleophile :NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2.\n        1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Because the intermediate is symmetrical with respect to the two carbons of the triple bond, attack at either position leads to the same product. For instance, if attack occurs at C1, a carbanion forms at C2. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C2. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and H atoms at all other positions. This is simply **aniline**.\n        *   Thus, Pathway B yields one product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible reaction pathways, we have identified three unique organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
