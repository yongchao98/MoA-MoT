  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Elucidation of the structure of Compound X from spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Region Analysis (to determine the substituent at position 4):**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂-CH₃).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (triplet) and another proton, hence it's a multiplet.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H is the methine proton (-CH-). This proton is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic), and it's also coupled to the adjacent methyl group (1.4 ppm) and the methylene group (1.7 ppm).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are a -CH₃ group, a -CH- group, and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The benzylic proton is the -CH- at 2.9 ppm. This -CH- is bonded to both the methyl group (1.4 ppm) and the ethyl group. This forms a `sec-butyl` group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option B.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analysis of the reaction.**\n\n    *   The reaction is with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   This reagent mixture is known for its ability to completely reduce many oxygen-containing functional groups to the corresponding alkane.\n    *   Specifically, it reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 3: Prediction of the final product.**\n\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 will remain unchanged.\n    *   The final product is therefore 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Matching the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl vs. sec-butyl).\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This structure matches our predicted final product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
