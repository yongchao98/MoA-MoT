    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations (states) of the system is 2^3 = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system for a given state (S1, S2, S3) is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT):\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible states, calculate the energy for each, and then sum their Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list the states and calculate their corresponding energies:\n\n1.  **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    S1=1, S2=1, S3=1\n    E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n2.  **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n    These two states have the same energy E1 = -3J. The degeneracy (number of states with this energy) is g1 = 2.\n\n3.  **States with two spins +1 and one spin -1:**\n    *   **(a) (+1, +1, -1):** E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **(b) (+1, -1, +1):** E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **(c) (-1, +1, +1):** E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n    These three states all have the same energy.\n\n4.  **States with one spin +1 and two spins -1:**\n    *   **(a) (+1, -1, -1):** E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **(b) (-1, +1, -1):** E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n    *   **(c) (-1, -1, +1):** E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n    These three states also have the same energy.\n\nCombining the states from steps 3 and 4, we find there are 3 + 3 = 6 states that have the energy E2 = J. The degeneracy for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\nSo, we have two distinct energy levels for the system:\n*   E1 = -3J with degeneracy g1 = 2\n*   E2 = J with degeneracy g2 = 6\n\nThe partition function Z can now be calculated using the formula Z = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i), where the sum is over the distinct energy levels.\n\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
