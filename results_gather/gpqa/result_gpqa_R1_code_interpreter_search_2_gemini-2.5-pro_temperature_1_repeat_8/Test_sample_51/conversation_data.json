    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two different energy levels changes between two scenarios: a star with no spots and a star with 40% of its surface covered by spots. This factor is the ratio of the population ratios: `(N2/N1)_nospots / (N2/N1)_spots`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The population of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the upper (level 2) and lower (level 1) energy states, respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the gas (in this case, the effective temperature of the stellar photosphere).\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (No spots):** The effective temperature is T₁ = 6000 K.\n        Ratio₁ = (N₂/N₁)₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   **Scenario 2 (With spots):** The overall effective temperature is T₂ = 5500 K.\n        Ratio₂ = (N₂/N₁)₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  **Formulate the Factor:** The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of Ratio₁ to Ratio₂.\n    Factor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n    Using the properties of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference between the levels is related to the wavelength (λ) of the transition by the Planck-Einstein relation: ΔE = h * c / λ.\n    *   h = Planck's constant\n    *   c = Speed of light\n    *   λ = Wavelength = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    It is more convenient to calculate the term ΔE/k directly:\n    ΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now, we substitute the known constants and given values into the equations. A Python script is ideal for performing this calculation accurately.\n\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   h (Planck's constant) = 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (Speed of light) = 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s\n        *   k (Boltzmann constant) = 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   **Given Values:**\n        *   λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   T₁ = 6000 K\n        *   T₂ = 5500 K\n\n    The script will compute `exp[ ((h*c)/(λ*k)) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23    # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Define the given parameters\nlambda_val = 1448e-10  # Wavelength in meters (1448 Å)\nT1 = 6000             # Temperature without spots in K\nT2 = 5500             # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Calculate the term Delta_E / k\ndelta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (lambda_val * k)\n\n# Calculate the factor\n# Factor = exp( (Delta_E / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) )\nfactor = np.exp(delta_E_over_k * (1/T2 - 1/T1))\n\nprint(f\"{factor:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n4.50\n>>>The calculation shows that the ratio of the level populations without spots is approximately 4.50 times larger than the ratio with spots. This matches option D. The extra information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not required for the calculation, as the effective temperatures for both states are provided directly.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels changes as the star's effective temperature changes. We are asked to find the value of `(N₂/N₁)_nospots / (N₂/N₁)_spots`.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   `N₂` and `N₁` are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels (which are properties of the atom and do not change).\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature of the gas.\n\n**2. Setting up the Ratios**\n\nLet T₁ be the temperature without spots and T₂ be the temperature with spots.\n*   `T₁ = 6000 K` (no spots)\n*   `T₂ = 5500 K` (with spots)\n\nThe ratio of populations for each case is:\n*   Ratio₁ = (N₂/N₁)₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n*   Ratio₂ = (N₂/N₁)₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n**3. Finding the Factor**\n\nWe need to find the factor of change, which is the ratio of Ratio₁ to Ratio₂:\n\nFactor = Ratio₁ / Ratio₂\nFactor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\n\nThe term with the statistical weights, (g₂ / g₁), cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nUsing the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T₁)) - (-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n**4. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength (λ) by the Planck-Einstein relation: `ΔE = hc/λ`.\nWe are given the wavelength of the transition: `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`.\n\nWe can calculate the term `ΔE/k` directly:\n\nΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n\nwhere:\n*   `h` = Planck's constant (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `c` = Speed of light (2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s)\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the formula for the factor. The previous code execution has already performed this calculation accurately.\n\n*   `T₁ = 6000 K`\n*   `T₂ = 5500 K`\n*   `λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n*   `ΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)`\n*   Factor = exp[ ((h * c) / (λ * k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\n\nThe code calculated this to be approximately 4.51.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated factor is ~4.51. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~1.1\nB) ~2.9\nC) ~7.8\nD) ~4.5\n\nThe value 4.51 is closest to 4.5. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of its surface covered by spots is not needed for the calculation, as the effective temperatures for both states are provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
