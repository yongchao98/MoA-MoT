    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze how each mutation affects the gene's product, the protein. A non-functional or absent protein will eliminate the compound. The goal is to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein's synthesis or structure.\n\nWe will analyze the DNA sequences by first grouping them into three-letter codons and then translating them into their corresponding amino acids. The intact gene begins with the start codon `ATG`.\n\n**1. Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’\n*   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Val... (until the stop codon `TGA`)\nThis sequence produces the full-length, functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Mutant:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Comparison:** The codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a *missense mutation*, which changes a single amino acid in the protein chain.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein is full-length but has one amino acid changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might reduce or alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Comparison:** The codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: A silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA` (Stop Codon): This is a *nonsense mutation*.\n    *   **Effect:** The `TAA` codon is a premature stop signal. Translation will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (Met-Phe) instead of a full protein. This truncated product will be non-functional. This is a highly effective way to knock out gene function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n    *   **Comparison:** The codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`, and `ACT` becomes `GTC`.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): A missense mutation.\n        *   `ACT` (Threonine) -> `GTC` (Valine): A missense mutation.\n    *   **Effect:** This mutant produces a full-length protein with two amino acid substitutions. Similar to Mutant 1, this might affect function, but it is less certain to eliminate it than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n    *   **Comparison:** The sequence shows that the `GGT` codon, which was between `GCT` and `ACT` in the intact gene, has been deleted.\n    *   **Effect:** The deletion of three nucleotides (one full codon) results in the removal of one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein. This is an *in-frame deletion*. While this changes the protein, it's generally less disruptive than a frameshift or a premature stop codon.\n    *   *(Note: If one or two nucleotides were deleted, it would cause a frameshift mutation, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and likely creating a premature stop codon. But here, exactly three nucleotides are deleted, which keeps the reading frame intact).*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four mutants, the introduction of a premature stop codon in **Mutant 2** is the most direct and certain way to prevent the synthesis of a functional protein. This nonsense mutation results in a severely truncated and non-functional product, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. The missense mutations (Mutant 1 and 3) and the in-frame deletion (Mutant 4) are less likely to guarantee complete loss of function.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most promising candidate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
