    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P₃ / P₁).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (P) of a planet to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law can be stated as P² ∝ a³. This implies that the ratio of periods is related to the ratio of semi-major axes as follows:\n        (P₃ / P₁)² = (a₃ / a₁ )³  =>  P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2).\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** This is the theoretical temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance and albedo. The relationship is T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a², where T_eq is the equilibrium temperature, A is the albedo, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis (a) to Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):**\n    From the equilibrium temperature relationship, T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a².\n    The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. This means the term (1 - A) is a constant for all planets and can be ignored when considering ratios.\n    So, T_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / a².\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    T_eq² ∝ 1 / a.\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of the equilibrium temperature T_eq:\n    a ∝ 1 / T_eq².\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet3 and Planet1 is:\n    a₃ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)².\n\n4.  **Combine the Relationships to Find the Period Ratio:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes (a₃ / a₁) into the equation from Kepler's Third Law:\n    P₃ / P₁ = [ (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)² ]^(3/2)\n    Simplifying the exponents (2 * 3/2 = 3), we get a direct relationship between the period ratio and the temperature ratio:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Temperature Ratio (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃):**\n    We are given two temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ = 1.4\n    *   T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ = 2.3\n    To find the ratio between Planet1 and Planet3, we multiply these two ratios:\n    T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:**\n    Now, use the formula derived in step 4 with the value calculated in step 5:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (3.22)³\n    P₃ / P₁ = 33.386248\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 33.4. This matches option A. The information about the planets' masses and the TTV method is extra data not required for this specific calculation, as the relationship between orbital period and distance is governed by Kepler's laws, and the relationship between temperature and distance is governed by radiative equilibrium.\n\nTo ensure precision in the calculation, we can use a short Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nT_ratio_1_2 = 1.4\nT_ratio_2_3 = 2.3\n\n# The relationship between orbital period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq)\n# for planets around the same star with the same albedo is P ∝ T_eq^(-3).\n# Therefore, P3/P1 = (T_eq1/T_eq3)^3.\n\n# First, calculate the temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3\nT_ratio_1_3 = T_ratio_1_2 * T_ratio_2_3\n\n# Now, calculate the period ratio\nP_ratio_3_1 = T_ratio_1_3 ** 3\n\nprint(P_ratio_3_1)\n```\n<execute_code>\n33.386248\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
