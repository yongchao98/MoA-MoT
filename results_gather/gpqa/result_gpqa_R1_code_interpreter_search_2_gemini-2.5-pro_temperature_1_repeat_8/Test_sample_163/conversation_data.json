    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of star A (K1_1) = 10 km/s\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of star B (K1_2) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of star C (K2_1) = 15 km/s\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of star D (K2_2) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem involves binary star systems for which we have orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes for both stars (double-lined spectroscopic binaries). The relationship between these observables and the total mass of the system is derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n\n4.  **Derive the Mass Formula:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis (a), and the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) of a system:\n        M_total = (4π² * a³) / (G * P²)\n        where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    *   For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) are related to the individual semi-major axes (a1 and a2) and the orbital inclination (i):\n        a1 * sin(i) = (P * K1) / (2π)\n        a2 * sin(i) = (P * K2) / (2π)\n\n    *   The total semi-major axis is a = a1 + a2. Summing the two equations above gives:\n        (a1 + a2) * sin(i) = a * sin(i) = (P / 2π) * (K1 + K2)\n\n    *   We can express 'a' in terms of the observed quantities:\n        a = [P * (K1 + K2)] / [2π * sin(i)]\n\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for 'a' back into Kepler's Third Law:\n        M_total = (4π² / (G * P²)) * [ (P * (K1 + K2)) / (2π * sin(i)) ]³\n        M_total = (4π² / (G * P²)) * [ P³ * (K1 + K2)³ / (8π³ * sin³(i)) ]\n\n    *   Simplifying this expression gives the formula for the total mass:\n        M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\n5.  **Analyze the Formula for a Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = { [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [2πG * sin³(i₁)] } / { [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³] / [2πG * sin³(i₂)] }\n\n    The constants 2πG will cancel out. The problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which means the inclination angle (i) is very close to 90° for both. Therefore, sin(i₁) ≈ sin(90°) = 1 and sin(i₂) ≈ sin(90°) = 1. So, the sin³(i) terms also cancel out.\n\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]\n\n6.  **Calculate the Values for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   Total velocity amplitude (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   Total velocity amplitude (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the calculated values into the ratio formula. Note that since we are taking a ratio, the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) will cancel as long as they are consistent for both systems.\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\n    M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to the option D) ~ 0.4.\n\nTo verify the calculation, a simple Python script is used.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_total)^3\n# We calculate the ratio of the proportionality terms\nmass_ratio = (P1 * K1_total**3) / (P2 * K2_total**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n0.432\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) can be determined using the formula derived from Kepler's laws:\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2πG * sin³(i))\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nWe need to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2:\nRatio = [ (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³) / (2πG * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³) / (2πG * sin³(i₂)) ]\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". This implies that the inclination angle `i` for both systems is very close to 90 degrees. Therefore, sin(i) ≈ sin(90°) = 1, and sin³(i) ≈ 1 for both systems.\n\nThe constants 2πG and the sin³(i) terms cancel out in the ratio, simplifying the equation to:\nRatio = [ P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   For system_1:\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   For system_2:\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nSubstitute these values into the simplified ratio formula:\nRatio = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\nRatio = 2 * (15/25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3/5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.432 is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
