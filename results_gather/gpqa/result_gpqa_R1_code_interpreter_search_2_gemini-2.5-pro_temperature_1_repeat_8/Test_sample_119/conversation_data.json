    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the key quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. Mathematically, `plx = 1/d` (when d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds). This means `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform distribution of stars:** This assumption implies that the number density of stars (let's call it ρ) is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   We want to find the number of stars within a certain volume of space. Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth).\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3) * π * d³`.\n    *   Since the star density ρ is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d³`.\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in a thin shell:**\n    *   Now, let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`. The number of stars in this shell, `dN`, is what we are interested in.\n    *   We can find this by differentiating the total number of stars `N(d)` with respect to the distance `d`.\n    *   `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3) * π * d³] = ρ * 4 * π * d²`.\n    *   So, the number of stars in the thin shell is `dN = (4 * π * ρ * d²) * dd`. This tells us that the number of stars per unit distance interval (`dN/dd`) increases proportionally to `d²`.\n\n4.  **Convert the relationship from distance to parallax:**\n    *   Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of *parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`) changes with `plx`. To do this, we need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the intervals `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`.\n    *   Rearranging this gives `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars, which must be positive, we can consider the magnitude: `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and find the final relationship:**\n    *   Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = (4 * π * ρ * d²) * dd`\n        `dN = (4 * π * ρ * (1/plx)²) * ((1/plx²) * d(plx))`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The term `4 * π * ρ` is a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
