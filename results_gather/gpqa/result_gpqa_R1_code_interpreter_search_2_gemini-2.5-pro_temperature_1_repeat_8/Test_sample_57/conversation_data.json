    "*   **Analyze the user's question:** The user is asking which of the given physical theories is free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences and therefore does not need a procedure called regularization. Regularization is a mathematical technique used to handle infinite quantities that arise in calculations, particularly in quantum field theories.\n\n*   **Evaluate option A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, while classical, encounters a problem with point charges. If you calculate the electrostatic self-energy of a point-like particle (e.g., an electron) with zero radius, the result is infinite. This is a high-energy/short-distance divergence. To get a finite result, one must introduce a \"cutoff,\" essentially assuming the particle has a small, non-zero radius. This is a form of regularization. Therefore, classical electrodynamics does require a form of regularization to deal with this issue.\n\n*   **Evaluate option C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. When calculating physical quantities using perturbation theory (represented by Feynman diagrams), loop diagrams lead to integrals over all possible momenta. These integrals often diverge as the momentum goes to infinity (the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\"). To make the theory predictive, one must first regularize these integrals (e.g., by imposing a momentum cutoff or using dimensional regularization) and then apply renormalization to absorb the infinities into the definitions of physical parameters like mass and charge. Thus, QED absolutely requires regularization.\n\n*   **Evaluate option D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory of the strong force. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory based on point-like particles (quarks and gluons). Consequently, it suffers from the same kind of ultraviolet divergences in its loop calculations. It also requires regularization and renormalization to produce finite, meaningful predictions.\n\n*   **Evaluate option B) Superstring Theory:** A key feature and a primary motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be a UV-complete theory. Unlike quantum field theories, which are based on point particles, the fundamental entities in string theory are one-dimensional extended objects called strings. Interactions in string theory are not point-like; they are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing has the effect of smoothing out the short-distance behavior that leads to ultraviolet divergences in conventional quantum field theories. Calculations of scattering amplitudes in string theory, which are the analogues of the problematic loop diagrams in QFT, yield finite results without the need for an external regularization procedure. The theory is said to be \"UV finite.\"\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the given options, Classical Electrodynamics, QED, and QCD all exhibit divergences at high energies/short distances that necessitate a regularization procedure. Superstring Theory is specifically constructed in a way that is believed to resolve these issues and be free of such divergences, thus not requiring regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
