    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Molecule 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** Biphenyls with bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') can exhibit a type of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. The bulky groups (here, nitro -NO2 and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH3) hinder free rotation around the central C-C bond. This locks the molecule into a twisted conformation.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Let's check for elements of symmetry that would make the molecule achiral. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on one side of a potential plane are not mirror images of the other. It also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because rotation is restricted and the molecule is asymmetric, it is chiral. It can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality:** We need to check for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n*   **Molecule 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Diphenyl ketone, (C6H5)2C=O.\n    *   **Chirality:** The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized (part of a double bond), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate, CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral. Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n    *   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n    *   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n    *   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
