    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concept:** The question is about the Mott-Gurney equation, which describes Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC). The fundamental idea behind SCLC is that at a sufficiently high voltage, an electrode injects so many charge carriers into an insulator or semiconductor that the material's intrinsic conductivity becomes irrelevant. The current is then limited not by the material's properties but by the repulsive electrostatic force (space charge) of the injected carriers themselves.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Mott-Gurney Equation:**\n    $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\n    *   **J ∝ V²:** This square-law dependence is the hallmark of SCLC. It's different from Ohm's law (J ∝ V).\n    *   **Single Carrier Mobility (μ):** The equation includes the mobility (μ) for a single type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). This implies the model is for a **single-carrier device**. If both electrons and holes contributed significantly, the equation would be much more complex.\n    *   **Material Properties (ε, μ):** The current depends on the material's dielectric constant (ε) and the carrier mobility (μ).\n    *   **No Trap-related Terms:** The equation in its given form is the simplest version. It does not contain any terms related to charge carrier trapping (which would alter the voltage dependence, often leading to J ∝ V^m where m > 2). Therefore, the model assumes a **trap-free** material.\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Assumptions for Deriving the Equation:** To derive the Mott-Gurney law, several key assumptions must be made:\n    *   **Single-Carrier Dominance:** Only one type of carrier (either electrons or holes) contributes to the current.\n    *   **Ohmic Contact / No Injection Barrier:** One of the contacts must be \"Ohmic\" in the sense that it can supply an unlimited reservoir of carriers to be injected into the device. This means there is no energy barrier preventing carriers from entering the material from the electrode. This is a crucial requirement to build up the space charge. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has a built-in energy barrier and is rectifying, which is not suitable for SCLC.\n    *   **Trap-Free Material:** The material is assumed to be a perfect insulator or semiconductor with no electronic states (traps) in the bandgap that can capture the injected carriers. If traps were present, they would \"trap\" some of the charge, and a higher voltage would be needed to fill the traps before observing true SCLC behavior.\n    *   **Drift Current Dominance:** The current is assumed to be driven by the electric field (drift current). The current arising from gradients in carrier concentration (diffusion current) is considered **negligible**. This is a valid approximation for devices that are not extremely thin and are under a reasonable applied bias.\n    *   **Low Intrinsic Carrier Density:** The density of injected carriers is assumed to be much greater than the material's intrinsic (thermally generated) carrier density.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   This statement is incorrect because it claims **drift current** is negligible. The entire phenomenon of SCLC is based on the drift of injected carriers, so drift current is the *dominant* mechanism, not a negligible one.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This is incorrect because a **Schottky contact** creates an energy barrier for carrier injection. The model requires an Ohmic contact that can freely supply carriers to form the space charge.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is derived for a **single-carrier** device. The presence of a second carrier type would fundamentally change the physics and the resulting equation.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   **Trap-free:** Correct.\n        *   **Single-carrier device:** Correct.\n        *   **No carrier injection barrier:** Correct. This is the physical meaning of the required \"Ohmic\" contact that acts as an infinite reservoir for charge carriers.\n        *   **Negligible diffusion current:** Correct. The model assumes drift current is dominant.\n        *   This statement accurately captures all the key assumptions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only one that correctly states all the necessary conditions for the validity of the simple Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
