    "*   **Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism for Compound (A)**\n    *   **Tautomerism**, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). This hydrogen atom can migrate to the carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**\n        *   Structure: A six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (α-carbons) are the carbons involved in the double bonds (C2, C3, C5, C6).\n        *   These α-carbons are sp2 hybridized and are bonded to one hydrogen and two other carbons. Looking closely at the structure, the carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the ring's double bonds. They do not have any attached hydrogen atoms. For example, the carbon at position 2 is bonded to the carbon at position 1 (C=O), the carbon at position 3 (C=C), and a hydrogen atom. Wait, let me re-check the structure. The molecular formula for p-benzoquinone is C6H4O2. The carbons with the oxygens (C1, C4) have no hydrogens. The other four carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) each have one hydrogen. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are C2, C6 (adjacent to C1) and C3, C5 (adjacent to C4). These carbons are sp2 hybridized and part of a C=C bond. While they have hydrogens, the enol form would be highly unstable as it would disrupt the conjugated system without forming a more stable aromatic system. Critically, tautomerism requires an α-hydrogen on an *sp3 hybridized carbon*. Benzoquinone lacks any sp3-hybridized α-carbons with α-hydrogens. Therefore, it does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n        *   Structure: A six-membered saturated ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH2 groups.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two α-hydrogens.\n        *   The presence of these highly acidic α-hydrogens (they are flanked by two carbonyl groups) allows this compound to readily undergo tautomerism. It tautomerizes to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows extensive tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound (B)**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH3 (a methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n        *   The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: Dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   Structure: It is the methyl ester of fumaric acid (*trans*-butenedioic acid). Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) in the middle of the C=C bond.\n        *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results**\n    *   Compound (A) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
