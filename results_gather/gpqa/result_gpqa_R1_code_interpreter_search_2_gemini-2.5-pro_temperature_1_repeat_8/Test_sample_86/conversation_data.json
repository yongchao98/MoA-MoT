    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure:**\n\n*   We have a halogen atom (-X) as one substituent.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons, a carbonyl group, and some hydrogens. The most common and stable group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   Combining these pieces, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n**3. Determine the Substitution Pattern from NMR clues:**\n\nThe two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in three ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4). The 1H NMR spectrum's aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) is highly sensitive to this arrangement.\n\n*   **Ortho-substitution:** Would lead to a complex pattern, likely four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Meta-substitution:** Would also lead to a complex pattern, often four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Para-substitution:** This arrangement is symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are also chemically equivalent. This symmetry results in a very distinct pattern: **two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H)**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against our predicted structure of a *para*-haloacetophenone:\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   Aromatic region: Two doublets (d), each for 2H.\n    *   Aliphatic region: One singlet (s) for the 3H of the methyl group (-CH3), typically around 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern of two doublets for 2H each, indicating a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are further downfield (7.8 ppm).\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons, which is the perfect signal for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option perfectly matches the structure of *para*-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Does not show the characteristic signals for a di-substituted aromatic ring. The chemical shifts are not in the expected aromatic range. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). If the molecule were an aldehyde, it would have only 7 carbon atoms (C6 for the ring, C1 for the CHO) to accommodate the halogen, contradicting the given total of 8 carbons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the spectrum of an aromatic compound. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that is consistent with all the information provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
