    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### **1. Mass Dimension Analysis**\n\nIn natural units ($\\hbar = c = 1$), the action $S$ is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x] = [\\text{length}]^4 = ([\\text{mass}]^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$.\n\nAny term in the Lagrangian density, including the kinetic terms and interaction terms, must have this mass dimension.\n\n### **2. Mass Dimension of the Fields**\n\nWe can deduce the mass dimension of the fields from their standard kinetic terms.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin, } \\psi} = \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$.\n    *   The dimension of the derivative operator is $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices.\n    *   The kinetic term must have a mass dimension of 4: $[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi] = M^4$.\n    *   So, $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$.\n    *   Assuming $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we have $[\\psi]^2 \\cdot M^1 = M^4$.\n    *   This gives $[\\psi]^2 = M^3$, and therefore the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for a gauge field (like the photon) is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin, } A} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   This term must also have a mass dimension of 4: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n    *   This implies $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$.\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n### **3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Its mass dimension must also be 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n\n*   The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$ is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is also dimensionless: $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n*   Now we substitute the dimensions we found for the fields:\n    $[\\kappa] \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$.\n*   Combine the powers of $M$:\n    $[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$.\n    $[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$.\n    $[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$.\n*   Solving for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$:\n    $[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$.\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory is related to the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability. The classification is as follows:\n\n*   **Super-renormalizable**: All coupling constants have a positive mass dimension.\n*   **Renormalizable**: All coupling constants have a non-negative mass dimension (zero or positive). The ones with dimension zero are strictly renormalizable.\n*   **Non-renormalizable**: The theory contains at least one coupling constant with a negative mass dimension.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1, which is negative. When a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, it means that at higher orders in perturbation theory, loop corrections will introduce divergences that are more severe. To cancel these new types of divergences, one would need to introduce new counterterms at each order of perturbation, leading to an infinite number of free parameters. Such a theory is not predictive and is considered non-renormalizable.\n\nTherefore, the theory with the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ is **not renormalizable**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
