    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton (the alpha-proton) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since these are not due to spin-spin coupling, it means there are two distinct species present in the sample. The fact that the peaks have roughly equal integrals suggests that these two species are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio. The similar chemical shifts imply that the two chemical environments are structurally very similar.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two different species, as they are separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography (LC). The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both species have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected product. This means the two species are isomers of each other (they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms). The equal intensities of the LC peaks reinforce the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR. The fact that the separation is clear at an \"elevated temperature\" is a clue related to the interconversion kinetics of the two species.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a product with a higher molecular weight than the expected compound. The MS data contradicts this, as both peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and, crucially, different NMR spectra. They can be separated by standard chromatography (like LC). If a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers were present, it would explain the two NMR peaks of equal intensity and the two LC peaks of equal intensity. Since they are isomers, they would have the same mass. This explanation fits all the observations. A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is restricted rotation around the amide bond (C-N bond), which has partial double-bond character. This leads to the existence of *cis* and *trans* isomers (atropisomers). These isomers are diastereomers (assuming the peptide has at least one other chiral center, which is standard for peptides made of L-amino acids). This phenomenon is known to be slow on the NMR timescale, leading to separate signals for each isomer, and the isomers can often be separated by LC.\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different chemical structure and almost certainly a different molecular weight. The MS data rules this out.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they have identical spectra. They also cannot be separated by standard LC (an achiral column). Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would show only one peak in the NMR and one peak in the LC. This contradicts the observations.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The evidence points overwhelmingly to the presence of a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers. The specific phenomenon is most likely cis/trans isomerism around an amide bond, a form of atropisomerism common in peptides that results in diastereomeric species.\n\n<<<B>>>"
