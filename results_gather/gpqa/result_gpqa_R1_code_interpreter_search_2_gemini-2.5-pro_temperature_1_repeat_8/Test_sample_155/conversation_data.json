    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond.\n        *   When mCPBA reacts with a *trans*-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene, it produces a *trans*-epoxide.\n        *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, and the reagent is achiral, the reaction can occur from either the top face or the bottom face with equal probability. This results in the formation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides. For oct-4-ene, these are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism is SN2-like, where water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-opening.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene. The established stereochemical rule for this transformation is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n\n    Let's verify this by following the intermediates:\n    *   We start with a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-trans-epoxides.\n    *   Let's consider the hydrolysis of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Water can attack C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C4: The configuration inverts from R to S. The configuration at C5 remains R. The product is **(4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5: The configuration inverts from R to S. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is **(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a center of inversion (or a plane of symmetry in its eclipsed conformation). It is a **meso compound**. Both attack pathways on one enantiomer of the epoxide lead to the same meso compound.\n    *   Similarly, hydrolysis of the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also exclusively yield the same meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-form)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene. The established stereochemical rule for this transformation is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n\n    Let's verify this by following the intermediates:\n    *   **Epoxidation:** *Syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry, the resulting cis-epoxide is a **meso compound** ((4R,5S)-cis-4,5-epoxyoctane). Attack from either the top or bottom face yields the same, single meso product.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-epoxide. Water attacks in an *anti* fashion.\n        *   Attack at C4: The configuration inverts from R to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5: The configuration inverts from S to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**. Since attack at the two equivalent carbons (C4 and C5) of the meso-epoxide is equally probable, a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers is formed.\n\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nSo, in total, there are three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n*   Compound M: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso)\n*   Compound R: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   Compound S: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nCompound M is a diastereomer of both Compound R and Compound S. Compounds R and S are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, Compound R and Compound S will elute at the same time, producing a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like M vs. R, and M vs. S) have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. Therefore, Compound M will have a different retention time from the R/S pair.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (M) and one for the co-eluting enantiomers (R and S).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers. It is designed to separate enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, it will separate Compound R from Compound S.\n    *   It will also separate the diastereomer, Compound M, from both R and S.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **three peaks**, one for each of the three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture (M, R, and S).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
