    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an initially uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero. Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity. A positive charge, +q, is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the positive charge +q inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** Electrons will be attracted towards the +q charge and will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To completely shield the conducting material from the electric field of the charge +q, a total charge of -q must be induced on the wall of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface within the bulk of the conductor enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this surface. For the net flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Since there is a +q charge inside, the induced charge on the inner surface must be -q.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of -q has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of +q must appear elsewhere in the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. In a conductor, excess charge resides on its outermost surface. Therefore, a charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges inside it. The conductor is an equipotential volume, and the electric field inside the conducting material is zero. This means that the arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the exact position of +q and the distribution of the -q on the inner surface) has no effect on the charge distribution on the outer surface or the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The +q charge on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that makes the conductor's surface an equipotential. Since the conductor is spherical and there are no other external charges or fields, the most symmetric and stable configuration is a uniform distribution. So, the charge +q spreads out uniformly over the outer spherical surface of radius R.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges present. However, due to the shielding effect, the field produced by the +q charge inside the cavity and the -q charge on the inner surface cancel each other out for any point outside the conductor. More formally, the field outside is determined solely by the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n\n    According to the shell theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law to a spherical surface of radius L passing through P), the electric field at an external point P due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at its center.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is +q.\n    *   The center of the outer surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is L.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{Q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n    Substituting $Q_{outer} = +q$, we get:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's radius (r), its position (s), the distance from the cavity's center to P (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all extraneous information designed to distract. The fundamental principle of electrostatic shielding by a conductor simplifies the problem. The external field only depends on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the geometry of the conductor's outer surface.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
