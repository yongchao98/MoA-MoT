    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Principles and Concepts**\n\nThis is a classic particle decay problem that relies on two fundamental principles of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy of the system after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum of the system after the decay.\n\nSince we are dealing with subatomic particles moving at high speeds, we must use the equations of special relativity.\n\n### **2. Initial State (Before Decay)**\n\n*   The positive pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Initial Momentum (**p_initial**) = 0.\n*   Initial Energy (**E_initial**) = The rest mass energy of the pion = **m_πc² = 139.6 MeV**.\n\n### **3. Final State (After Decay)**\n\n*   The products are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   Let their momenta be **p_μ** and **p_ν**, and their total energies be **E_μ** and **E_ν**.\n\n### **4. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν** (These are vectors)\n    *   This implies **p_μ** = -**p_ν**. The muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    *   |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n### **5. Relativistic Energy Equations**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by:\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nAlso, a particle's total energy is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy:\nE = KE + mc²\n\nFor the neutrino (ν), its rest mass is extremely small and considered to be zero in this context (a standard assumption in such problems).\n*   For the neutrino (m_ν ≈ 0): E_ν² = (p_νc)² + 0  =>  **E_ν = p_νc = pc**.\n*   Since E_ν = KE_ν + m_νc², we have **KE_ν = E_ν = pc**.\n\nFor the muon (μ⁺):\n*   E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   **KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²**\n\n### **6. Solving for the Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations. Let's solve for the kinetic energies.\n\n1.  From energy conservation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n2.  Substitute E_ν = pc: m_πc² = E_μ + pc  =>  pc = m_πc² - E_μ\n3.  Now use the energy-momentum relation for the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n4.  Substitute the expression for `pc` from step 2 into step 3:\n    E_μ² = (m_πc² - E_μ)² + (m_μc²)²\n5.  Expand the squared term:\n    E_μ² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μc²)²\n6.  The E_μ² terms on both sides cancel out. Rearrange to solve for E_μ:\n    2(m_πc²)E_μ = (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²\n    **E_μ = [(m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]**\n\nNow we can calculate the values.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using the derived formula\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# From energy conservation, the total energy of the neutrino is E_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy is its total energy (KE_nu = E_nu)\nKE_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKinetic Energy of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (ν). This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe decay of a particle at rest is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince the particles involved are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Initial State (Before Decay)**\n\n*   The positive pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    *   E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero.\n    *   p_initial = 0\n\n**3. Final State (After Decay)**\n\n*   The products are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   Let the energy and momentum of the muon be E_μ and p_μ, respectively.\n*   Let the energy and momentum of the neutrino be E_ν and p_ν, respectively.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   p_initial = p_final\n*   0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν** (Note: momentum is a vector)\n*   This equation tells us that the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: **p_μ** = -**p_ν**.\n*   Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`:  |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**6. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation:\nE² = (pc)² + (m_c²)²\n\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n    *   E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   **For the neutrino (ν):**\n    *   Neutrinos are considered massless (or have negligible mass) in this context. So, m_ν = 0.\n    *   E_ν² = (pc)² + 0  =>  E_ν = pc\n\n**7. Solve the System of Equations**\n\nWe have the following key equations:\n1.  m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n2.  E_ν = pc\n3.  E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nLet's solve for the energies:\n*   From (1) and (2), we can write: pc = m_πc² - E_μ\n*   Now substitute this expression for `pc` into equation (3):\n    *   E_μ² = (m_πc² - E_μ)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   Expand the squared term:\n    *   E_μ² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μc²)²\n*   The E_μ² term cancels out on both sides. Rearrange to solve for the total energy of the muon, E_μ:\n    *   2(m_πc²)E_μ = (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   E_μ = [ (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]\n\n**8. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nGiven:\n*   m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n\n*   **Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_μ):**\n    *   E_μ = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n    *   E_μ = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n    *   E_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\n*   **Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ):**\n    *   The total energy is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy (E = KE + mc²).\n    *   KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n    *   KE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = **4.12 MeV**\n\n*   **Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    *   First, find the total energy of the neutrino from energy conservation:\n        *   E_ν = m_πc² - E_μ\n        *   E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = 29.78 MeV\n    *   Since the neutrino is considered massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    *   KE_ν = **29.78 MeV**\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
