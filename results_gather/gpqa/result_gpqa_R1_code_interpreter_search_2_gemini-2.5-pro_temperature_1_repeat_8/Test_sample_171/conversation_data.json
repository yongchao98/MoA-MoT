    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms over various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n**1. Understand the Boltzmann Equation:**\nThe stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which allows us to use the Boltzmann equation. The equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states (say, an excited state 'b' and a ground state 'a') to the temperature of the system.\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in state 'b' ($N_b$) to the number of atoms in state 'a' ($N_a$) is given by:\n  \n  $N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T))$\n  \nWhere:\n*   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   $E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the two levels, which we'll call $\\Delta E$.\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n*   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Set up the Equations for Both Stars:**\nLet the ratio of the population of the excited state to the ground state be $R$. For the same iron transition in two different stars, the statistical weights ($g_b$, $g_a$) are the same. Let's denote the constant term $(g_b / g_a)$ as C.\n\nFor star_1, with temperature $T_1$:\n  $R_1 = (N_{excited,1} / N_{ground,1}) = C * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))$\n\nFor star_2, with temperature $T_2$:\n  $R_2 = (N_{excited,2} / N_{ground,2}) = C * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n**3. Use the Information from the Problem:**\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms in star_1 is double that in star_2.\n  \n  $R_1 = 2 * R_2$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_1$ and $R_2$:\n\n  $C * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ C * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2)) ]$\n\nThe constant C cancels from both sides:\n\n  $exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))$\n\n**4. Solve for the Relationship between T1 and T2:**\nTo solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n  $ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms ($ln(e^x) = x$ and $ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$):\n\n  $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k * T_2))]$\n  \n  $-\\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_2)$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate $ln(2)$:\n\n  $\\Delta E / (k * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k * T_1) = ln(2)$\n\nFactor out the common term $\\Delta E / k$:\n\n  $(\\Delta E / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)$\n\nCombine the fractions within the parenthesis:\n\n  $(\\Delta E / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)$\n\n**5. Use the Given Numerical Values:**\nThe problem provides the energy difference: $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\nThe Boltzmann constant is $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the factor $(\\Delta E / k)$:\n\n  $(\\Delta E / k) \\approx (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K) \\approx 1$ K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\n  $1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n  $ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]$\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
