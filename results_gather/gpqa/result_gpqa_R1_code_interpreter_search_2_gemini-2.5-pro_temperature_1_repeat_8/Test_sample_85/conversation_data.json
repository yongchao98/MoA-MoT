    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a substituted lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n*   **Lactone:** A cyclic ester.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring) which is saturated (tetrahydro) and has a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. This specific structure is also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **Numbering:** In heterocyclic systems like this, the heteroatom (oxygen) is numbered 1. The adjacent carbonyl carbon is C2.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the carbon at position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The two reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers, respectively.\n\nThe structure of the lactone ring is:\n`O(1)-C(=O)(2)-CH2(3)-CH(Et)(4)-CH2(5)-CH2(6)` where C6 is bonded back to O1 to close the ring.\n\nThis six-membered lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a **5-hydroxycarboxylic acid**. Let's determine the structure of this precursor acid by conceptually breaking the ester bond of the lactone. Breaking the `O(1)-C(2)` bond and adding H2O gives:\n\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)`\n\nThis precursor is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**. The chiral center at C3 of this acid becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone. The configuration (R/S) is retained during lactonization.\n*   (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials provided in the options are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure.\n*   This is a derivative of glutaric acid (pentanedioic acid) which has a carboxylic acid group at both ends of a 5-carbon chain.\n*   In this molecule, one carboxylic acid has been converted to an isobutyl ester. The other remains a free carboxylic acid.\n*   The IUPAC name indicates the free carboxylic acid defines the C1 position.\n*   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n*   This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COOR'). It also has a chiral center at C3.\n\nThe reagents are two different selective reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 reduces the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material A (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 is unaffected.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`, which is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the final product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A determines the stereochemistry of the final product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material B (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with BH3.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group at C5 is unaffected.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` (isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate).\n    4.  During the acidic workup (H+), an intramolecular transesterification can occur. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone ring and releasing isobutanol. This reaction also yields the same final product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry of the starting material B determines the stereochemistry of the final product. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
