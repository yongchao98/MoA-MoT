    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Recall the relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. The fundamental relationship is:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance:**\n    We can substitute the relationship from step 2 into the given relation from step 1.\n    Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This relation `N ∝ r^5` means that the *cumulative number of stars* out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is asking for the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`, which mathematically corresponds to the derivative of the cumulative number `N` with respect to the distance `r`. We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative:**\n    We have the proportionality `N ∝ r^5`. We can write this as `N = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    Now, we differentiate `N` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`), we get:\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n    Since `5k` is just another constant, we can write the proportionality:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance changes with distance `r` as `r^4`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
