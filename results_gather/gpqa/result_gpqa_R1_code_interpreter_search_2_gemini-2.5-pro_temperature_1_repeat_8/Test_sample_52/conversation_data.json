    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe problem provides a detailed description of the 1H NMR spectrum, which allows us to count the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Aromatic-H:** There are \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene derivative) has 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the ring (C6H4). These 4 hydrogens give rise to the two signals. So, there are **4 aromatic hydrogens**.\n*   **Vinyl-H:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there is one proton for each signal, for a total of **2 vinyl hydrogens**. The splitting pattern (doublet and doublet of quartets) gives us more structural information, but for counting, we just need the number of signals.\n*   **–CH3 groups:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". Each methyl (–CH3) group contains 3 hydrogen atoms. Since there are two distinct methyl groups, the total number of hydrogens from these groups is 2 * 3 = **6 hydrogens**.\n\nNow, let's sum the hydrogens from all parts of the molecule:\nTotal Hydrogens = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H) = 4 + 2 + 6 = **12 hydrogens**.\n\nThis finding immediately allows us to eliminate two of the possible answers, as they do not have 12 hydrogen atoms.\n*   A) C11H**12**O2 (Possible)\n*   B) C12H**12**O2 (Possible)\n*   C) C11H**14**O2 (Eliminated)\n*   D) C12H**14**O2 (Eliminated)\n\n**2. Analyze the Structural Features to Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (or Double Bond Equivalent, DBE) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can determine the required DBE from the structural information given.\n\n*   **6-membered aromatic ring:** A benzene ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing **4** to the DBE.\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (R-COO-R'). This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes **1** to the DBE.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons means there is a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which contributes **1** to the DBE.\n\nTotal required DBE = (from aromatic ring) + (from C=O) + (from C=C) = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n**3. Calculate the DBE for the Remaining Options**\n\nNow we calculate the DBE for the two remaining formulas (A and B) using the formula:\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen does not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2:**\n    DBE = 11 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    This value matches the required DBE of 6 calculated from the spectral data.\n\n*   **B) C12H12O2:**\n    DBE = 12 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 13 - 6 = **7**.\n    This value does not match the required DBE of 6. A molecule with this formula would need an extra ring or pi bond, which contradicts the provided spectral information.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total hydrogen count and the degree of unsaturation, only the formula C11H12O2 is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   The total hydrogen count (12 H) eliminates C11H14O2 and C12H14O2.\n*   The required degree of unsaturation (DBE=6) eliminates C12H12O2.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\nTo confirm, a possible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n*   Formula: C11H12O2.\n*   Aromatic H: 4H (2 signals for para-substitution).\n*   Vinyl H: 2H (a doublet and a doublet of quartets from the -CH=CH-CH3 group).\n*   CH3 groups: 2 signals (one from the propenyl group, one from the methyl ester).\n*   No CH2 groups.\n*   DBE: 6 (benzene ring=4, C=C=1, C=O=1).\nThis structure perfectly matches all the data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
