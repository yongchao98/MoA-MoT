    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Observational Constraints**\n\nFirst, we need to establish the conditions a star must meet to be observable by *both* instruments. This involves two criteria: visibility from both locations (based on declination) and brightness (based on apparent magnitude).\n\n*   **Criterion 1: Visibility (Declination)**\n    A star can only be observed if it rises above the horizon at the observatory's location. This depends on the observatory's latitude and the star's declination (DEC).\n\n    1.  **Find Observatory Latitudes:**\n        *   Paranal Observatory (hosting ESPRESSO) is in Chile. A search reveals its latitude is approximately **-24.6 degrees**.\n        *   W. M. Keck Observatory (hosting HIRES) is in Hawaii. A search reveals its latitude is approximately **+19.8 degrees**.\n\n    2.  **Calculate Common Declination Range:**\n        *   For an observer in the northern hemisphere (like Keck, latitude `L ≈ +19.8°`), the southernmost declination they can theoretically see is `L - 90°`. So, `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n        *   For an observer in the southern hemisphere (like Paranal, latitude `L' ≈ -24.6°`), the northernmost declination they can theoretically see is `L' + 90°`. So, `-24.6° + 90° = +65.4°`.\n        *   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be in the common range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n*   **Criterion 2: Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)**\n    The star must be bright enough for both spectrographs.\n\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: Apparent V magnitude < 17.0 mag.\n    *   HIRES limit: Apparent V magnitude < 16.0 mag.\n    *   To be detected by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **< 16.0 mag**.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria**\n\nWe will now check each star's declination and apparent magnitude. For stars where the apparent magnitude is not given, we will calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `m` is the apparent magnitude, `M` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the interstellar absorption.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constraints\ndec_min = -70.2\ndec_max = 65.4\nmag_limit = 16.0\n\nprint(f\"Constraint 1: Declination must be between {dec_min:.1f} and {dec_max:.1f} degrees.\")\nprint(f\"Constraint 2: Apparent V magnitude must be < {mag_limit:.1f}.\\n\")\n\n# --- Star 1 ---\ndec1 = -75\nis_dec1_ok = dec_min < dec1 < dec_max\nprint(\"--- Star 1 ---\")\nprint(f\"DEC = {dec1} deg.

    "To determine which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, we must check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star's declination (DEC) must be within the observable range for both observatories.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of *both* instruments.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Common Observational Constraints**\n\n*   **Visibility (Declination Range):**\n    *   Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. The northernmost declination it can see is `-24.6° + 90° = +65.4°`.\n    *   Keck Observatory is at a latitude of approximately +19.8°. The southernmost declination it can see is `+19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both locations, its declination must be in the common range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n*   **Brightness (Apparent Magnitude Limit):**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with `m_V < 17.0`.\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with `m_V < 16.0`.\n    *   To be observed by both, a star must meet the stricter requirement. Therefore, the star's apparent magnitude must be **`m_V < 16.0`**.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) when the absolute magnitude (`M_V`) is given: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10pc) + A_V`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the absorption in the V band. Note that `5 * log10(d/10pc)` is the same as `5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   DEC = -75°.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** -75° is outside the common range (-70.2° to +65.4°).\n    *   **Result:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   DEC = 55°.\n    *   `m_V` = 16.5 mag.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** 55° is within the common range.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** 16.5 is not < 16.0.\n    *   **Result:** Not observable by both (too faint for HIRES).\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   DEC = 48°.\n    *   `m_V` = 15.5 mag.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** 48° is within the common range.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** 15.5 is < 16.0.\n    *   **Result:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   DEC = -48°.\n    *   `M_V` = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** -48° is within the common range.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absorption: `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n        *   Apparent Magnitude: `m_V = M_V + 5*log10(10) - 5 + A_V = 15.5 + 5*1 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n        *   16.74 is not < 16.0.\n    *   **Result:** Not observable by both (too faint for HIRES).\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   DEC = 60°.\n    *   `M_V` = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** 60° is within the common range.\n    *   **Brightness Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Apparent Magnitude: `m_V = M_V + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 ≈ 14.99` mag.\n        *   14.99 is < 16.0.\n    *   **Result:** **Observable by both.**\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
