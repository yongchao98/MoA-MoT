    "SMEFT, or the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM). It does this by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian, which are suppressed by a high energy scale Î›. The construction of SMEFT is based on certain fundamental principles and symmetries. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, which is the foundation for any relativistic quantum field theory (QFT), including the Standard Model and its effective field theory extensions. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the new higher-dimensional operators, are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** This is the full symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime, encompassing both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Invariance under translations is what guarantees the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational assumption of the QFT framework upon which SMEFT is built. Thus, it must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry (Charge-Parity):** This symmetry is already known to be violated in the Standard Model itself, specifically by the weak interaction (as seen in the decay of kaons and B-mesons). Since the SM Lagrangian is just the leading part of the SMEFT Lagrangian, there is no reason to impose CP symmetry on the higher-dimensional operators. In fact, many SMEFT operators can introduce new sources of CP violation, which are actively being searched for in experiments. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time):** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must adhere to the CPT theorem. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are the fundamental symmetries of the underlying QFT framework. From the list provided, these are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is already violated in the SM and is not imposed on the SMEFT operators.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
