    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2\n\n*   **λ1**: This is the mean free path (MFP) of the gas molecules within the sample compartment. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with *another gas molecule*.\n*   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the electrons from the microscope's beam. It represents the average distance an electron travels before colliding with (scattering off of) a *gas molecule*.\n\n### 2. Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is fundamentally determined by two factors: the density of target particles and the size of the \"target\" that each particle presents. The general formula is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Components for λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collision)\n\n*   **Particles:** Gas molecules moving and colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The density of target gas molecules, let's call it `n_gas`.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1):** This is the cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another identical gas molecule. In a simple hard-sphere model, if a molecule has a diameter `d`, two molecules will collide if their centers get within a distance `d` of each other. The effective target area is therefore σ1 ≈ πd².\n*   **Refinement:** A more precise formula for the MFP of a gas of identical molecules accounts for the relative motion of the particles, introducing a factor of √2.\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ1) = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * πd²)\n\n### 4. Analyze the Components for λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collision)\n\n*   **Particles:** High-energy electrons from the beam colliding with gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n):** The target particles are the gas molecules, so the density is the same `n_gas` as in the first case (the pressure, volume, and temperature of the gas have not changed).\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2):** This is the cross-section for a high-energy electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   An electron is, for practical purposes in this context, a point particle. It is vastly smaller than a gas molecule.\n    *   The collision is not a simple \"billiard ball\" impact. It's an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) between the fast-moving electron and the electric fields of the molecule's nucleus and its electron cloud.\n    *   For very high-energy electrons (1000 kV is extremely high), the interaction is less likely than a low-energy one. The electron is moving so fast that it can often pass through the molecule's electron cloud with little deflection. The scattering cross-section (σ2) is therefore significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section (σ1) for two molecules.\n*   **Formula for λ2:** Since the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered stationary targets. The √2 factor is not needed.\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ2)\n\n### 5. Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nWe have:\n*   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ1)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ2)\n\nThe key to the comparison is the relative size of the cross-sections, σ1 and σ2.\nBased on our analysis in step 4:\nσ1 (molecule-molecule collision) >> σ2 (high-energy electron-molecule scattering)\n\nSince the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), a much smaller cross-section results in a much larger mean free path.\n\nBecause σ1 >> σ2, it must be that **λ1 << λ2**.\n\n### 6. Evaluate the Options\n\nNow let's look at the given choices:\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  (This implies λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1)\n*   B) λ2 < λ1  (This implies electrons collide more frequently than molecules, which is incorrect)\n*   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (This would only be true if the collision cross-sections were identical, which they are not)\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (This states that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least 1.22)\n\nOur conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (λ2 >> λ1). Option D is the only one that correctly captures this relationship. While the exact ratio (λ2/λ1) could be orders of magnitude (e.g., 100s or 1000s), it is certainly greater than 1.22.\n\n<<<D>>>"
