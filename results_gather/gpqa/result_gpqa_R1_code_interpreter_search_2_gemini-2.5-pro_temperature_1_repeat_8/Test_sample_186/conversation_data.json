    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT telescope. The detection criterion is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\nFirst, let's establish the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO to achieve this S/N. The official ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) is the most accurate tool for this. Based on the ETC for ESPRESSO in 1-UT mode (using one 8m telescope), to achieve an S/N of 10 in a 3600-second (1-hour) exposure under typical seeing conditions (e.g., 0.8 arcsec), the target star needs to be brighter than approximately V = 18.5 mag. Stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 18.5 will be detectable, while those fainter will not.\n\nWe also need to consider if the stars are observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. Stars with a declination (DEC) significantly north of the celestial equator (e.g., > +30°) are difficult or impossible to observe from this location.\n\nLet's evaluate each star:\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky with an apparent V magnitude of approximately -0.74. This is much brighter than the V = 18.5 limit.\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of about -52° 42'. This is well within the observable range for the VLT at Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** Polaris has an apparent V magnitude of about +1.98. This is also much brighter than the V = 18.5 limit.\n*   **Observability:** Polaris has a declination of approximately +89° 16'. As the North Star, it is located very close to the north celestial pole. It is impossible to observe from the Southern Hemisphere's Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is **not detectable** from Paranal.\n\nFor stars c, d, e, and f, we need to calculate their apparent V magnitude (m) using their absolute V magnitude (M) and distance (d). The formula is:\nm = M - 5 + 5 * log10(d)\nHere, M = 15 mag, and the distance d is given in parsecs (pc). The coordinates (RA=0 deg, DEC=0 deg) are on the celestial equator, which is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star with M = 15 mag, d = 10 pc:**\n*   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = 15 mag.\n*   Since V = 15 is brighter than the limit of 18.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M = 15 mag, d = 200 pc:**\n*   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200) = 10 + 5 * (2.301) ≈ 10 + 11.5 = 21.5 mag.\n*   Since V = 21.5 is fainter than the limit of 18.5, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M = 15 mag, d = 5 pc:**\n*   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) = 10 + 5 * (0.699) ≈ 10 + 3.5 = 13.5 mag.\n*   Since V = 13.5 is brighter than the limit of 18.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M = 15 mag, d = 50 pc:**\n*   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50) = 10 + 5 * (1.699) ≈ 10 + 8.5 = 18.5 mag.\n*   Since V = 18.5 is at the limit of our estimated threshold, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**Summary of Detectable Stars:**\n1.  Canopus (a)\n2.  Star at 10 pc (c)\n3.  Star at 5 pc (e)\n4.  Star at 50 pc (f)\n\nIn total, there are 4 detectable stars.\n\n<<<D>>>"
