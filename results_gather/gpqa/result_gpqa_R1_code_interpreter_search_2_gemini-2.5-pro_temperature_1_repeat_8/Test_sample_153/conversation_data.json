    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope combination is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M⁺ peak to the M⁺+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This 3:1 ratio is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine (Cl) atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options. All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive and characteristic absorption for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options A and B.\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: An acid chloride/ester. It lacks the O-H group for the broad peak. Its C=O stretch would be at a much higher frequency (~1775 cm⁻¹).\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: An aldehyde with a phenol group. While it has an O-H and C=O group, the O-H stretch of a phenol is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid, and the very broad range down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is classic for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This leaves us with options **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton. This further supports that the compound is a carboxylic acid (C or D).\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** We have two signals in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H): This signal corresponds to two equivalent protons that are split into a doublet, meaning they have one neighboring proton.\n    *   7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H): This signal also corresponds to two equivalent protons that are split into a doublet.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The presence of only two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,4-disubstituted. It has a plane of symmetry. The two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group (at C2 and C6) are chemically equivalent. The two protons ortho to the chlorine atom (at C3 and C5) are also chemically equivalent. The C2/C6 protons are adjacent to the C3/C5 protons, resulting in two doublets. This matches the observed spectrum perfectly. The more electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group causes its ortho protons (8.02 ppm) to appear further downfield than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,2-disubstituted. It has no plane of symmetry that makes protons equivalent. All four aromatic protons are chemically distinct. This would result in a more complex spectrum with four different signals (likely multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of evidence point to one structure. The MS shows a formula of C₇H₅ClO₂. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR (two doublets, each for 2H) is only consistent with the 1,4-disubstituted (para) structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
