    "This problem is about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it relates to energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The problem involves distinguishing two energy levels of quantum states that have finite lifetimes. A finite lifetime (Δt) for a state introduces an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE) in its energy level. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which corresponds to the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n    For estimations, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width (ΔE) for Each State:**\n    To resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their respective energy widths. Let's calculate these widths first. We'll need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units that are convenient for this problem, which are electron-volt-seconds (eV·s).\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s):**\n        The energy width is ΔE₁. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty.\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s):**\n        The energy width is ΔE₂.\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" the Levels:**\n    To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly greater than the energy widths of the levels. A common criterion is that the separation should be greater than the sum of their individual widths.\n    *   Required energy difference > (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂)\n    *   Required energy difference > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required energy difference > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required energy difference > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Even using a simpler criterion, that the separation must be larger than the broadest width (ΔE₁), we get:\n    *   Required energy difference > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We need to find an option for the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that is greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation that is large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels, as it is several orders of magnitude larger than the combined energy widths of the states.\n\n### Python Code for Verification\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a short Python script.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# For the levels to be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than their widths.\n# A good criterion is that the difference should be greater than the sum of the widths.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy separation > {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-9,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-11,\n    'D': 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    print(f\"Option {key}: {value:.1e} eV. Is it greater than required separation? {value > required_separation}\")\n\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nRequired energy separation > 7.240e-07 eV\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A: 1.0e-09 eV. Is it greater than required separation? False\nOption B: 1.0e-04 eV. Is it greater than required separation? True\nOption C: 1.0e-11 eV. Is it greater than required separation? False\nOption D: 1.0e-08 eV. Is it greater than required separation? False\n\nThe code confirms that only option B provides a sufficient energy difference.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem requires us to apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understand the Principle:**\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy. This can be interpreted as the \"width\" of the energy level.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which in this case is the lifetime (τ) of the quantum state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor practical calculations, we can approximate the relationship as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\nWe need to calculate the inherent energy width (ΔE) for each of the two states due to their finite lifetimes.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, let's call it |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than the energy widths of the states. A common criterion (the Rayleigh criterion for spectral lines) is that the separation must be at least as large as the broader of the two widths. A more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths.\n\nLet's use the broader width as our minimum requirement. The broader width belongs to the state with the shorter lifetime, so we must have:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options:**\nWe need to find the option that satisfies this condition.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This separation is sufficient for the levels to be clearly resolved.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷). The levels would still significantly overlap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only energy difference that is large enough to allow the two energy levels to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
