    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves a solution of the calcium-EDTA complex (Ca-EDTA). This complex is stable but will slightly dissociate into its constituent ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (in its fully deprotonated form, typically denoted as Y⁴⁻, as we assume an ideal pH for complexation). The dissociation is an equilibrium process.\n\n2.  **Write the chemical equation:** The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    *   Formation: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n    *   Dissociation: CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, [CaY²⁻]initial = 0.02 M.\n    *   The formation constant (also called stability constant), K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    *   We need to find the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺].\n\n4.  **Relate the formation constant (K_f) to the dissociation constant (K_d):** The dissociation constant (K_d) is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction. It is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   K_d = 1 / K_f\n    *   K_d = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n5.  **Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):** Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species       | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| CaY²⁻         | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y⁴⁻           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n6.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:**\n    *   K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻]\n\n7.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:**\n    *   2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n8.  **Simplify the equation using an approximation:** Since the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This implies that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation:\n    *   0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n9.  **Solve the simplified equation for x:**\n    *   2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n\n    To make the square root easier, we can write 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    *   x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    *   Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    *   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n10. **Final check:** The calculated value of x is indeed the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺].\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n    This value matches option A. The approximation (6.32 x 10⁻⁷ << 0.02) is valid.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_formation = 5e10\ninitial_concentration_complex = 0.02\n\n# The dissociation constant Kd = 1 / K_formation\n# The equilibrium expression is Kd = x^2 / (initial_concentration - x)\n# We can approximate this as Kd = x^2 / initial_concentration\n# x^2 = Kd * initial_concentration\n# x^2 = (1 / K_formation) * initial_concentration\n# x = sqrt(initial_concentration / K_formation)\n\nx_squared = initial_concentration_complex / K_formation\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.3e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the Dissociation Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA ion) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the reaction Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻.\n    K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction is the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| CaY²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** The equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻]\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n    Since the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹), the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means very little of the complex dissociates, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴) = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.32.\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\n    [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution (6.3e-07). Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 2.0x10⁻² M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
