    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the magnitude of two energy values:\n1.  The paramagnetic coupling energy, which we'll denote as $\\langle H \\rangle$. This is the energy shift experienced by an atomic orbital due to an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect).\n2.  The transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponding to a specific spectral line of the Hydrogen atom.\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\langle H \\rangle$**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic coupling (the linear Zeeman effect) is given by:\n$H_p = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H_p = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{k}$. The dot product becomes $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n$H_p = \\frac{e B}{2m_e} L_z$\n\nThe energy shift, which is the expectation value $\\langle H \\rangle$, is obtained by replacing the operator $L_z$ with its eigenvalue, $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\langle H \\rangle = \\frac{e B}{2m_e} (m\\hbar) = m \\left( \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\right) B$\n\nThe quantity in the parenthesis is the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n$\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$\\langle H \\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ is a small integer. Let's take $m=1$ for a representative calculation, as it's the smallest non-zero integer value.\n\n$\\langle H \\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T})$\n$\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ can be calculated from the given wavelength $\\lambda$ of the emitted photon using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nA useful form of this relation is:\n$\\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})}$\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n*Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer beta ($H_{\\beta}$) transition in the Hydrogen atom, from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level.*\n\n**3. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\langle H \\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTo see the relationship clearly, let's take their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.551 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n$5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} \\ll 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
