    "This problem requires a two-step calculation. First, we determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer system formed by H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. Second, we use this [H+] to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) from the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O). In solution, these salts dissociate completely:\n*   KH2PO4 -> K+ + H2PO4-\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O -> 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O\n\nWe need to calculate the moles of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, and then their concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n\nMoles of H2PO4- = (1.00 g) / (136.09 g/mol) = 0.007348 mol\nConcentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\nMoles of HPO4^2- = (1.00 g) / (177.99 g/mol) = 0.005618 mol\nConcentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\nThe species H2PO4- (an acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base) form a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\nThe equilibrium constant is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n\nThe expression for Ka2 is:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\nUsing the concentrations calculated in Step 1:\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * 1.308\n[H+] = 8.110x10^-8 M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of HPO4^2-:\nHPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nWe use the [H+] calculated in Step 2 and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since its dissociation is very small, its equilibrium concentration is virtually unchanged).\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.110x10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.236x10^-7 M\n\nThis value is very close to option D.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given data\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99\nvolume_L = 0.200\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# Assume equilibrium concentrations of buffer components are equal to initial concentrations.\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n6.24e-07\n\nThe calculation yields 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Components and the System:** The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. In water, these salts dissociate completely into their ions.\n    *   KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate)\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate) + 2H2O\n    The key species are H2PO4- (an acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base). Together, they form a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations:** First, we need to find the molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = (mass of KH2PO4) / (Molar mass of KH2PO4) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = (mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O) / (Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**: The pH of the buffer is determined by the equilibrium involving the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- pair, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n    *   Equilibrium: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   Equilibrium constant: Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8\n    *   The Ka2 expression is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   Plugging in the concentrations (we assume the equilibrium concentrations are the same as the initial ones, which is a valid approximation for a buffer):\n        [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**: The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of HPO4^2-, which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka3.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   Equilibrium constant: Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n    *   The Ka3 expression is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We rearrange this to solve for the unknown, [PO4^3-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   Now, we use the [H+] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since its dissociation is negligible):\n        [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n        [PO4^3-] = 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10^-7 M. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 3.97x10^-7 M\n    B) 2.81x10^-7 M\n    C) 5.48x10^-7 M\n    D) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option D. The Python code execution confirmed this result as 6.24e-07 M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
