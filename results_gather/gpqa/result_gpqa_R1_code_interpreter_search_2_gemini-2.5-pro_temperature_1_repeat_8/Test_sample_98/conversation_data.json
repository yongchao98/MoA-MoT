    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between them. We must use the NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\nThe key pieces of information from the 1H NMR spectrum are the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons in the molecule.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   Coupling to **one** adjacent proton (n=1) gives a **doublet** (n+1=2).\n    *   Coupling to **two** adjacent protons (n=2) gives a **triplet** (n+1=3).\n    *   Coupling to **three** adjacent protons (n=3) gives a **quartet** (n+1=4).\n    Therefore, we are looking for a CH group that is adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   Coupling to **one** adjacent proton (n=1) gives a **doublet** (n+1=2).\n    *   Coupling to **two** adjacent protons (n=2) gives a **triplet** (n+1=3).\n    *   Coupling to another, different set of **two** adjacent protons (n=2) gives another **triplet** (n+1=3).\n    Therefore, we are looking for a CH group that is adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's analyze the local environment of the protons in each structure to see if they can produce the observed splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)**\n`      CH₃(f)`\n`      |`\n`COOH - C(H)(e) - C(H)(c) - CH₂(b) - CH₃(a)`\n`                |`\n`                CH₃(d)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is adjacent to H(e) (1H), the CH₂(b) group (2H), and the CH₃(d) group (3H). This proton would produce a **dtq** signal.\n*   **Search for a dtt:** We need a proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. No proton in this structure fits this description. For example, H(e) is coupled to H(c) (1H) and H(f) (3H), which gives a dq (doublet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's draw out the structure corresponding to the formula:\n`      CH₂CH₃(g)`\n`      |`\n`CH₃(e)-C(H)(d) - C(H)(c) - CH₂(b) - COOH(a)`\n`            |`\n`            CH₂CH₃(f)`\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is adjacent to H(c) (1H), the CH₂ group of the ethyl sidechain (f) (2H), and the terminal CH₃(e) group (3H). This proton would produce a **dtq** signal.\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is adjacent to H(d) (1H), the CH₂(b) group (2H), and the CH₂ group of the other ethyl sidechain (g) (2H). This proton would produce a **dtt** signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure B contains protons that would generate both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This matches the experimental data.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n`      CH₂CH₃(f)`\n`      |`\n`COOH - C(H)(e) - C(H)(c) - CH₂(b) - CH₃(a)`\n`                |`\n`                CH₂CH₃(d)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is adjacent to H(e) (1H), the CH₂(b) group (2H), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl sidechain (d) (2H). This proton would produce a **dtt** signal.\n*   **Search for a dtq:** We need a proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group. No proton in this structure fits this description. For instance, H(e) is coupled only to H(c) (1H) and the CH₂ of ethyl group (f) (2H), giving a dt.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C has a `dtt` but no `dtq`. It is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`      CH₃(f)`\n`      |`\n`COOH - CH₂(a) - C(H)(b) - C(H)(c) - CH₃(d)`\n`                     |`\n`                     CH₃(e)`\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is adjacent to the CH₂(a) group (2H), H(c) (1H), and the CH₃(e) group (3H). This proton would produce a signal that could be described as a `tdq` (triplet of doublets of quartets), which fits the neighbor requirements for a `dtq`.\n*   **Search for a dtt:** We need a proton coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups. No proton in this structure has this environment. H(c) is coupled to H(b) (1H), CH₃(d) (3H), and CH₃(f) (3H).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly structure **B**, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has the correct combination of proton environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
