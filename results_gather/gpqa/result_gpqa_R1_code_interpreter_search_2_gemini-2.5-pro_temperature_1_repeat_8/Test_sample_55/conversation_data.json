    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay from the hydrogen atom state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. We need to identify the intermediate state and the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition $|n,l,m\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. For a decay (emission), $n' < n$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition:** The atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (with $n=3, l=0, m=0$). It decays to an intermediate state $|I\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' = 1$. The intermediate state must have orbital angular momentum $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   The principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3. A common cascade decay path involves the lowest possible energy change, so $n'=2$ is the most likely intermediate principal quantum number. All the options in the question propose an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** The atom then decays from the intermediate state $|I\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ (with $n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This requires $m'$ to be $0, \\pm 1$. All three possible intermediate states satisfy this condition.\n\n    So, three possible decay routes exist:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** We need to find the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n        The transition rate is determined by the interaction of the atom with the electromagnetic field vacuum. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (an s-state) is spherically symmetric. The vacuum is isotropic (it has no preferred direction). Due to this symmetry, there is no reason for the atom to preferentially decay into one of the $m'$ sublevels over the others. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal.\n\n        Formally, the transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element $|\\langle n',l',m'|\\textbf{r}|n,l,m\\rangle|^2$. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this can be shown to be proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$, the rate is proportional to $|\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$. The value of this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 1 for all $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        \n        Since the rates are equal for all three outcomes, and they are the only possible outcomes for the first step, the probability for each is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** We need the probability of the transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        Once the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a 2p state), the only allowed electric dipole transition to the $n=1$ shell is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). There are no other final states for this decay channel. Therefore, the probability of this transition, given the atom is in the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Probability for a Specific Route:**\n    The overall probability for a given route is the product of the probabilities of its constituent steps. Let's calculate it for the route specified in options C and D, which goes through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P(\\text{route}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The calculated probability for this route is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The calculated probability for this route is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n\nThe correct transition route and corresponding probability are given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
