    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Masses and Energies of the Fragments**\n\n*   Let M be the rest-mass of the initial nucleus. Its rest-mass energy is given as M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Let m1 and m2 be the rest-masses of the two fragments.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate the more massive fragment as m1, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nNow, we can solve for m1 and m2 in terms of M:\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now find m1:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1):\n    `m1*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2):\n    `m2*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after. The energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n    *   Initial energy = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n    *   Final rest-mass energy = m1*c² + m2*c² = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    *   Total kinetic energy (Q) = Initial Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The total momentum of the fragments must also be zero.\n    *   `p1 + p2 = 0`, which implies `p1 = -p2`.\n    *   This means the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T1 (Relativistic)**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\nSince total energy `E = T + m*c²` (where T is kinetic energy), we can write:\n`(p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)`.\n\nSince the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)² = (p2*c)²`. Therefore:\n`T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`.\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `T1 + T2 = 3` (so `T2 = 3 - T1`)\n2.  `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = T2² + 2*T2*(99)`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`T1² + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)² + 198*(3 - T1)`\n`T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1² + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1²`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nThis is the correct, relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T1 (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum is `T = p² / (2*m)`.\nFrom conservation of momentum, we know `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\nSo, `p² = 2*m1*T1_classical` and `p² = 2*m2*T2_classical`.\nTherefore, `2*m1*T1_classical = 2*m2*T2_classical`.\n`m1*T1_classical = m2*T2_classical`.\n\nThis gives us the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV.

Rearranging, `(p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)²`.\nSince `E = T + m*c²`, we can write `(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)² = (p2*c)²`, which means:\n`T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`.\n\nWe have two equations to solve for T1:\n1) `T2 = 3 - T1`\n2) `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = T2² + 2*T2*(99)`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`T1² + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*99`\n`T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**4.

    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the solution.\n\n**1. Define initial and final states:**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c² = 300 GeV`. Its initial momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2` and kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n\n**2. Use the given mass relationships to find the fragment masses:**\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   This means `m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n*   Now, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to find the total kinetic energy:**\n*   The total energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value of the reaction) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c² - (m1*c² + m2*c²)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n*   So, the total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is 0. The total momentum of the fragments must also be 0.\n*   This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value):**\n*   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n*   Since `E = T + m*c²`, we can write `(p*c)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)`.\n*   Because the momentum magnitudes are equal (`p1² = p2²`):\n    `T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `T2 = 3 - T1`\n    2.  `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = T2² + 2*T2*(99)`\n*   Substitute (1) into (2):\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)² + 198*(3 - T1)`\n    `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation):**\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T_classical = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `p1² = p2²`.\n    `2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n    `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n*   This gives a ratio of kinetic energies:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n    So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`:\n    `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**7. Find the difference:**\n*   Difference = `T1 (relativistic) - T1 (classical)`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>"
