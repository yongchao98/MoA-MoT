    "*   **Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n    1.  **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH)**:\n        *   Acetic acid is a weak acid.\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles CH3COOH = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n    2.  **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**:\n        *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates into H+ and Cl-.\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles HCl = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n        *   Therefore, Moles of H+ from HCl = 0.080 mol\n\n    3.  **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2)**:\n        *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it completely dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH-.\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles Ba(OH)2 = Volume × Concentration = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n        *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH-,\n        *   Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the neutralization reactions.**\n\n    The strong base (OH-) will react with all available acidic protons. This includes the protons from the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n    *   Total moles of acidic protons = (Moles of H+ from HCl) + (Moles of CH3COOH)\n    *   Total moles of acidic protons = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n\n    *   Total moles of base (OH-) = 0.180 mol\n\n    Now, compare the moles of acid and base.\n    *   Moles of base (0.180 mol) > Moles of acid (0.130 mol)\n    *   This means the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the moles of excess OH-.**\n\n    The excess moles of OH- are the initial moles of OH- minus the moles of acidic protons that were neutralized.\n    *   Excess moles of OH- = Total moles OH- - Total moles acidic protons\n    *   Excess moles of OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-.**\n\n    First, find the total volume of the final solution.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n    Now, calculate the concentration of OH-.\n    *   [OH-] = (Excess moles of OH-) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the pOH and pH.**\n\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167)\n\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n\n    We can compute the exact value using a calculator or a simple script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of excess OH-\nmoles_oh_excess = 0.050\n\n# Total volume in Liters\ntotal_volume = 1.200\n\n# Concentration of excess OH-\nconc_oh_excess = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_excess)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=}\")\n```\n```output\npH=12.619788758288331\n```\nThe calculated pH is approximately 12.62.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 12.62\nC) 8.68\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of HCl (a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it fully dissociates, providing 0.080 mol of H+.\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that provides two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are:\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻\n\n**2. Determine the total moles of acid and base:**\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (protons to be neutralized):**\n    *   The strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons, both from the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Total moles of acid = Moles of H⁺ from HCl + Moles of CH3COOH\n    *   Total moles of acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of base:**\n    *   Total moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n\n**3. Identify the excess reactant:**\n\n*   Compare the total moles of base (0.180 mol) to the total moles of acid (0.130 mol).\n*   Since moles of OH⁻ > moles of acid, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n**4. Calculate the moles of excess OH⁻:**\n\n*   The excess OH⁻ is the amount left after all the acid has been neutralized.\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Initial moles of OH⁻ - Moles of acid neutralized\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**5. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻:**\n\n*   First, find the total volume of the final solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻.\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**6. Calculate the pOH and then the pH:**\n\n*   **pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
