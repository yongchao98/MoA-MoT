    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, a magnetic field `B` is in the `+Z` direction. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_i = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z) = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z) = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the System:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, governed by the new Hamiltonian `H`. The state at a later time `t` is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting `H` and `|ψ(0)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+z> = e^(iγB S_y t/ħ) |+z>`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n    `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n    So, we need to calculate `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\n    Let's use the Heisenberg picture, which is often more direct for this type of problem. In the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time, and the state remains fixed at `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. The equation of motion for an operator `A` is:\n    `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) <[A, H]> + <∂A/∂t>`\n    Since `S_z` is not explicitly time-dependent, the second term is zero.\n\n    *   **Equation for `<S_z>`:**\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_z, H]> = (1/iħ) <[S_z, -γB S_y]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_z, S_y]>`\n        Using the spin commutation relation `[S_i, S_j] = iħε_ijk S_k`, we have `[S_z, S_y] = iħε_zyx S_x = -iħS_x`.\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (-iħ<S_x>) = -γB <S_x>`\n\n    *   **Equation for `<S_x>`:**\n        We now have a differential equation relating `<S_z>` to `<S_x>`. Let's find the equation for `<S_x>`.\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) <[S_x, H]> = (1/iħ) <[S_x, -γB S_y]> = (-γB/iħ) <[S_x, S_y]>`\n        Using the commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`.\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB/iħ) (iħ<S_z>) = -γB (-<S_z>) = γB <S_z>`\n\n5.  **Solve the Coupled Differential Equations:**\n    We have the system:\n    1) `d<S_z>/dt = -γB <S_x>`\n    2) `d<S_x>/dt = γB <S_z>`\n\n    Differentiate the first equation with respect to `t`:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = -γB (d<S_x>/dt)`\n    Substitute the second equation into this:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = -γB (γB <S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\n    This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`.\n    The solution oscillates with an angular frequency `ω`. By comparing the equations, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation for `<S_z>` is:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The average of the z-component of the particle's spin, `<S_z>(t)`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n    Since the magnetic moment `μ_z` is directly proportional to `S_z` (`μ_z = γS_z`), its expectation value `<μ_z>(t)` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency `ω_L = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
