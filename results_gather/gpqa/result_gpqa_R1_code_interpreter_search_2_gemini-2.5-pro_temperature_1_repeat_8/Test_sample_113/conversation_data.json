    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone.\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   Butan-2-one (CH₃COCH₂CH₃) is the ketone substrate.\n        *   Sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the nucleophile, the cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, the α-hydroxy nitrile (cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. An acidic medium provides these protons. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acidic solution (e.g., from adding a mineral acid like HCl or H₂SO₄). This is the standard condition for completing cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, usually with heating. The reaction proceeds in two steps: first, hydrolysis to an amide intermediate, and then further hydrolysis of the amide to the carboxylic acid and ammonia (or ammonium ion in acid).\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis in the presence of water (H₂O).\n        *   Let's compare the options for B: HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid).\n        *   Complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires vigorous conditions. A strong acid like HCl is a much more effective and commonly used catalyst for this transformation than a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH). While acetic acid could catalyze the reaction to a small extent, it would be extremely slow and likely incomplete. For a synthetic transformation like this, a strong acid catalyst is the standard and appropriate choice.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Therefore, B = HCl.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, the suitable reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, the suitable reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
