    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`) + Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`)\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (`NaOEt`) in ethanol (`EtOH`).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The base `NaOEt` deprotonates the acidic α-hydrogen of dimethyl malonate (the proton between the two carbonyl groups) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group) is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition. The structure is `p-Tolyl-C(β)H=C(α)H-COOCH₃`.\n    3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and this intermediate is then protonated by the ethanol solvent.\n    4.  **Product Formation:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        *   Donor fragment: `-CH(COOCH₃)₂`\n        *   Acceptor fragment after reaction: `-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`\n        *   Combining them gives the final product structure:\n            `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂-COOCH₃`\n    5.  **Product Naming (A):** Let's name this structure according to the options. The name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` describes a propane chain (`C₃-C₂-C₁`) with substituents.\n        *   At C-1: Two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`)\n        *   At C-2: A p-tolyl group (`-CH(p-Tolyl)-`)\n        *   At C-3: A methoxycarbonyl group (`-CH₂-COOCH₃`)\n        *   Assembling this gives: `(CH₃OOC)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This is identical to the structure derived from the reaction mechanism. Thus, A is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`)\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (`MeOH`), then aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which involves a Michael addition of an enamine nucleophile.\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C-2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (`CH₃-C(β)H=`) is the electrophilic site.\n    3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    4.  **Workup:** The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (`H₃O⁺`) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    5.  **Product Formation (B):** The overall reaction results in the alkylation of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) at its α-position.\n        *   The cyclohexanone ring is reformed.\n        *   The substituent, derived from but-2-enenitrile, is attached to the α-carbon (C-2) of the cyclohexanone. The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n        *   The final product is a butanenitrile chain with a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group at position 3.\n        *   The IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable tautomer.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`)\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (`KOH`), water (`H₂O`).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify one of the starting materials (C). We can do this by performing a retrosynthesis (working backward from the product).\n    1.  **Identify the Bond Formed:** A Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor (as an enolate) and the β-carbon of the acceptor. The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part is the Michael donor, and the `(3-oxobutyl)` part came from the Michael acceptor. The bond was formed between C-2 of the dione ring and C-2 of the butyl chain.\n    2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor:** The `(3-oxobutyl)` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, is formed by the addition to an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The corresponding acceptor is `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`, which is but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone), matching the given reactant.\n    3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):** The donor must be the species that, after deprotonation by KOH, provides the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton. The starting material C must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base `KOH` removes the highly acidic proton from C-2 (between the two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that performs the addition.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination of products and reactants matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
