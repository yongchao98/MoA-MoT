    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum track length, or resolution, needed to observe a certain fraction of particle decays. This involves concepts from special relativity, specifically time dilation and the relativistic energy-momentum relation, as well as the exponential nature of radioactive decay.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the minimum distance, let's call it $d$, that the particle $X^0$ travels in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber) before it decays. We are given the condition that we want to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means we are looking for the distance over which the probability of a particle decaying is 30%.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The particle $X^0$ has a proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s. This is the lifetime as measured in the particle's own rest frame. Since the particle is moving at a very high speed in the lab frame, its lifetime as observed in the lab will be longer due to time dilation. The lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau$, is given by:\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and its rest mass energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$). The relationship is:\n    $E = \\gamma E_0$\n    We are given:\n    *   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass, $m_{X^0} = 3.41$ GeV/c², which means the rest mass energy is $E_0 = 3.41$ GeV.\n\n    Therefore, the Lorentz factor is:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n4.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle has decayed within a time $t$ (as measured in the lab frame) is given by:\n    $P_{\\text{decay}}(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\\tau}$\n    We want this probability to be 30%, or 0.3.\n    $0.3 = 1 - e^{-t_{30\\%}/\\tau}$\n    Solving for the time $t_{30\\%}$:\n    $e^{-t_{30\\%}/\\tau} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n    $-t_{30\\%}/\\tau = \\ln(0.7)$\n    $t_{30\\%} = -\\tau \\ln(0.7)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance:** The distance the particle travels in the lab frame is $d = v \\cdot t$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. For a highly relativistic particle (since $\\gamma \\approx 7.9$), the velocity $v$ is extremely close to the speed of light, $c$. So we can approximate $v \\approx c$.\n    The distance required to observe 30% of the decays is:\n    $d_{30\\%} = c \\cdot t_{30\\%} = c \\cdot (-\\tau \\ln(0.7))$\n\n6.  **Combine and Compute:** Now we substitute all the expressions and values together:\n    $d_{30\\%} = c \\cdot (-\\gamma \\tau_0 \\ln(0.7))$\n    $d_{30\\%} = c \\cdot \\left(\\frac{E}{E_0}\\right) \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot (-\\ln(0.7))$\n\n    Using the given values and the speed of light $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $d_{30\\%} = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{27}{3.41}\\right) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot (-\\ln(0.7))$\n    $-\\ln(0.7) \\approx 0.3567$\n    $d_{30\\%} \\approx (3 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (7.918) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16}) \\cdot (0.3567)$\n    $d_{30\\%} \\approx 6.77 \\times 10^{-7}$ m\n\nTo get a more precise value, we can use a small Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants and given values\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nE0 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in s\ndecay_fraction = 0.3 # We want to observe this fraction of decays\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor\ngamma = E / E0\n\n# Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame\ntau_lab = gamma * tau0\n\n# Calculate the time 't' by which the given fraction of particles decay\n# P(t) = 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab) => t = -tau_lab * ln(1 - P(t))\ntime_for_decay = -tau_lab * np.log(1 - decay_fraction)\n\n# The particle is highly relativistic, so its speed is approximately c.\n# The distance traveled is d = c * t.\ndistance = c * time_for_decay\n\nprint(f'{distance:.2e} m')\n```\nExecution of the code yields:\n```\n6.77e-07 m\n```\nThe calculated distance is $6.77 \\times 10^{-7}$ m. We now compare this result with the given options:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between our calculated value and the options provided. Let's re-examine the question's premise. The proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ is the *mean* lifetime. The time required for 30% of decays to occur is $t_{30\\%} \\approx 0.357 \\tau$. A different interpretation might be to find the average distance a particle travels before decaying, which is $d_{avg} = c \\cdot \\tau = c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\nLet's calculate this average distance:\n$d_{avg} = c \\gamma \\tau_0 = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{27}{3.41}\\right) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThis value, $1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy might arise from a different interpretation of \"minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays\". Often, in such problems, the mean decay length itself is considered the characteristic length scale required for observation. The mean decay length is the distance at which $1 - 1/e \\approx 63\\%$ of the particles have decayed. If we are asked to observe a significant fraction (like 30%), the mean decay length is a reasonable estimate for the necessary resolution.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided solution key in light of our calculations.\nOption A: $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n$d = c \\gamma \\tau_0 = (2.998 \\times 10^8) \\times (27/3.41) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nThe provided option A is likely the intended answer, representing the mean decay length, despite the phrasing about \"at least 30%\". The small numerical difference between $1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ could be due to slightly different constants or a typo in the question's options. Given the choices, the mean decay length provides the correct order of magnitude and is the most plausible physics-based answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle in the CERN Bubble Chamber. This \"resolution\" can be interpreted as the minimum track length the particle must travel for us to have a 30% chance of seeing its decay.\n\n2.  **Apply Special Relativity Concepts:**\n    *   The particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber). Therefore, its lifetime as observed in the lab will be longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation.\n    *   The proper lifetime is given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau_{lab}$, is given by the formula: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\n    *   The formula is $E = \\gamma E_0$.\n    *   We are given the total energy $E = 27$ GeV.\n    *   We are given the rest mass $m_{X^0} = 3.41$ GeV/c², which means the rest energy is $E_0 = 3.41$ GeV.\n    *   Therefore, we can calculate $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lab-Frame Lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$):**\n    *   Now, we use the time dilation formula:\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s.\n    *   This $\\tau_{lab}$ is the *mean lifetime* in the lab frame.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question and Calculate the Distance:**\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays\". This can be interpreted in two main ways:\n\n    *   **Interpretation A (Literal):** Find the distance $d$ over which the probability of decay is exactly 30%.\n        The probability of a particle decaying within time $t$ is $P(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$. We want $P(t) = 0.3$.\n        $0.3 = 1 - e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$\n        $e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}} = 0.7$\n        $t = -\\tau_{lab} \\ln(0.7) \\approx 0.357 \\tau_{lab}$\n        The distance is $d = v \\cdot t$. Since $\\gamma \\approx 7.9 \\gg 1$, the particle's velocity $v$ is extremely close to the speed of light, $c$. So we can approximate $d \\approx c \\cdot t$.\n        $d \\approx c \\cdot (0.357 \\tau_{lab}) = c \\cdot (0.357 \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0)$\n        $d \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (0.357) \\cdot (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.78 \\times 10^{-7}$ m.\n        This value does not match any of the options.\n\n    *   **Interpretation B (Practical/Contextual):** In particle physics, a common way to specify the required detector resolution is to use the *mean decay length*, $L$. This is the average distance a particle travels before decaying.\n        The mean decay length is $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$. Again, we approximate $v \\approx c$.\n        $L \\approx c \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n        A detector with a resolution of $L$ would observe the fraction of decays given by $1 - e^{-L/L} = 1 - e^{-1} \\approx 0.632$, or 63.2%. Since 63.2% is greater than 30%, this resolution is sufficient. Let's calculate this value.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation for Mean Decay Length:**\n    We will use a Python script to get a precise value for the mean decay length, $L = c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants and given values\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\nE = 27  # Total energy in GeV\nE0 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor\ngamma = E / E0\n\n# Calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame\ntau_lab = gamma * tau0\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length L = c * tau_lab\n# This is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.\nmean_decay_length = c * tau_lab\n\nprint(f'{mean_decay_length:.3e} m')\n\n```\nExecution of the code yields:\n```\n1.896e-06 m\n```\nThe calculated mean decay length is $L \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Calculated mean decay length: $1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    *   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    *   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\n    The calculated value $1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. They are of the same order of magnitude, and the numerical value is only off by about 9%. This small discrepancy is likely due to slightly inconsistent values given in the problem statement. The other options are incorrect by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, the question is most likely asking for the mean decay length as the characteristic resolution required.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a summary of the reasoning and calculation:\n\n1.  **Objective:** Determine the minimum track length (resolution) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n2.  **Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime. The lab-frame lifetime is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest energy ($E_0$). $\\gamma = E/E_0$.\n    *   **Decay Length:** The distance a particle travels before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, this distance is approximately its lifetime multiplied by the speed of light, $c$.\n\n3.  **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays\" can be ambiguous.\n    *   A literal interpretation would be to find the distance over which exactly 30% of particles decay. This calculation yielded a result of $\\approx 6.77 \\times 10^{-7}$ m, which does not match any of the options.\n    *   A more common interpretation in experimental particle physics is to use the **mean decay length** ($L$) as the characteristic length scale required for observation. The mean decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. At this distance, about $1 - 1/e \\approx 63.2\\%$ of particles will have decayed, which satisfies the condition of observing \"at least 30%\". This interpretation is standard for problems where a detector resolution is requested.\n\n4.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest Mass Energy, $E_0 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   **Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n    *   **Calculate the mean decay length, $L$:**\n        $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} \\approx c \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n        $L \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times (7.918) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s})$\n        $L \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated mean decay length is $1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We compare this to the given options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\n    The calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference (about 9%) is likely due to slight inconsistencies in the values provided in the problem statement. Option A is the only choice that is physically plausible and of the correct order of magnitude.\n\n<<<A>>>"
