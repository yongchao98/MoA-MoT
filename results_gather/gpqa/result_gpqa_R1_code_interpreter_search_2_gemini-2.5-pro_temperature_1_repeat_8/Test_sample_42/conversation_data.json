    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound**\nThe question lists several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant number 1 (C1).\n\n**Step 2: Decode the Positional Information to Build the Structure**\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, using C1 for the -COOH group.\n\n1.  **Main Groups:** The carboxylic acid (at C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all *meta* to one another. This means they are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring. So, if -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups are at C3 and C5 (in some order).\n\n2.  **Para Substituent:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, the **-OCH3 group is at C4**.\n\n3.  **Ortho Substituents:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the -OH and -N(CH3)2 groups are at C2 and C6 (in some order).\n\n4.  **Final Constraint:** The methoxy group (-OCH3 at C4) and the hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. Let's test the two possible positions for the -CN group (C3 or C5).\n    *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The description says -OCH3 (which is at C4) and -OH must be ortho to -CN. This would place the **-OH group at C6**. This is consistent with -OH being ortho to the C1-COOH group.\n    *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. This would place the **-OH group at C2**. This is also consistent with -OH being ortho to the C1-COOH group.\n\n    Both cases seem possible. Let's complete the structures for both.\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 1 (-CN at C5):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C6: -OH\n        *   This leaves C2 for -N(CH3)2 and C3 for -CHO.\n        *   Resulting Structure (A): C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2 (-CN at C3):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   This leaves C6 for -N(CH3)2 and C5 for -CHO.\n        *   Resulting Structure (B): C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH3)2).\n\nNotice that Structure A and Structure B are mirror images. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise). The final step is to apply the IUPAC numbering rules to decide which direction is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n1.  **Lowest Locant Set Rule:** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in both numbering schemes. The locant set is {2,3,4,5,6} for both. This rule results in a tie.\n\n2.  **Tie-Breaker Rule (Alphabetical Order):** When the lowest locant set rule results in a tie, we give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, let's list the substituents alphabetically (treating them as prefixes):\n        *   **C**yano\n        *   **D**imethylamino\n        *   **F**ormyl\n        *   **H**ydroxy\n        *   **M**ethoxy\n\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives the -CN group the lowest possible number.\n\n    *   Let's check our two structures/numbering schemes:\n        *   In Structure A, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n        *   In Structure B, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme from **Structure B is correct**.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\nUsing the correct numbering from Structure B, we list the substituents alphabetically, preceded by their locants.\n*   **Structure B:**\n    *   C1: -COOH (Parent: benzoic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (2-hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (3-cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (4-methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (5-formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (6-(dimethylamino))\n\n*   **Assembling the name alphabetically:**\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\n*   **Final Name:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Given Options**\nThe derived name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
