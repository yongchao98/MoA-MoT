    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We need to identify the gases and their quantities based on the changes in the tubes' weights.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 16.00 ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (which would form a CaCO₃ precipitate) or other acidic oxides (NOx, SOx). The problem states the weight of this tube **did not change**. This is a critical clue that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is what's left after removing water and oxygen, and we know it's not acidic. The most plausible identity for a gas produced from nitrogen-containing salts under these conditions is nitrogen gas (N₂), which is relatively inert.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Elemental Composition**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the identified products equals the initial mass of the salts.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture exactly. This confirms our identification of the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) and their quantities is correct. It also tells us that the original salts A and B must be composed solely of the elements Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture (equal moles) of two salts, A and B, containing only N, H, and O, which decompose to produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O. The most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of salt A = NH₄NO₂ and salt B = NH₄NO₃.\nThe relevant decomposition reactions are:\n1.  NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar, so let's assume we have `x` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₃. Let's calculate the total moles of each product based on these reactions.\n\n*   **From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂:** produces `x` mol of N₂ and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n*   **From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃:** We use the stoichiometry of reaction 2.\n    *   `x` mol NH₄NO₃ × (2 mol N₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = `x` mol N₂\n    *   `x` mol NH₄NO₃ × (1 mol O₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = `0.5x` mol O₂\n    *   `x` mol NH₄NO₃ × (4 mol H₂O / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = `2x` mol H₂O\n\nNow, we sum the products from both decompositions:\n*   Total Moles N₂ = (`x` from A) + (`x` from B) = `2x`\n*   Total Moles O₂ = (0 from A) + (`0.5x` from B) = `0.5x`\n*   Total Moles H₂O = (`2x` from A) + (`2x` from B) = `4x`\n\nWe can solve for `x` by comparing these expressions to our calculated moles from Step 1:\n*   Total N₂: `2x` = 0.10 mol  =>  `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol =>  `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total H₂O: `4x` = 0.20 mol   =>  `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield a consistent value: `x` = 0.05 mol. This confirms our hypothesis. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's use a python script to verify the mass calculation.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_NH4NO2 = 14.01 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 16.00 * 2  # Ammonium Nitrite\nM_NH4NO3 = 14.01 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 16.00 * 3  # Ammonium Nitrate\n\n# Moles of each salt\nmoles_each = 0.05\n\n# Calculate the total mass\ntotal_mass = (moles_each * M_NH4NO2) + (moles_each * M_NH4NO3)\n\n# Print the total mass to verify against the problem's given value of 7.20 g\nprint(f\"Calculated Molar Mass of NH4NO2: {M_NH4NO2:.2f} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Molar Mass of NH4NO3: {M_NH4NO3:.2f} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total calculated mass: {total_mass:.2f} g\")\n\n# Calculate the total number of atoms\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2 # N, H, O in NH4NO2\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3 # N, H, O in NH4NO3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry problem. I will break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Identify the products of the decomposition and their amounts.**\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed upon heating the salts. This gaseous mixture is passed through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g. Therefore, the mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the tube's weight corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted. The weight increased by 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all the tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the previous reagents. Given that the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common component of energetic salts), this gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂), which is very inert.\n\n**2. Verify the elemental composition and total mass.**\nLet's calculate the total mass of the products we've identified:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass exactly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification of the products and their quantities is correct. It also tells us that the original salts A and B must be composed only of the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\n**3. Identify the salts A and B.**\nWe are looking for two salts containing only N, H, and O, which decompose upon heating to produce N₂, H₂O, and O₂. The mixture is equimolar. The most common salts that fit this description are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's check their decomposition reactions:\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Salt B: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture contains 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   From 'x' mol of NH₄NO₂, we get:\n    *   `x` mol of N₂\n    *   `2x` mol of H₂O\n*   From 'x' mol of NH₄NO₃, we get (based on the stoichiometry of the reaction):\n    *   `x` mol of N₂\n    *   `0.5x` mol of O₂\n    *   `2x` mol of H₂O\n\nNow let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `x` (from A) + `x` (from B) = `2x`\n*   Total moles of O₂ = `0` (from A) + `0.5x` (from B) = `0.5x`\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2x` (from A) + `2x` (from B) = `4x`\n\nWe can now use the moles we calculated in step 1 to solve for 'x':\n*   From N₂: `2x` = 0.10 mol  =>  `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol =>  `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From H₂O: `4x` = 0.20 mol   =>  `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations give a consistent value of `x = 0.05` mol. This confirms that our mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The python script executed previously also verified that a mixture of 0.05 mol of each of these salts has a total mass of ~7.20 g.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
