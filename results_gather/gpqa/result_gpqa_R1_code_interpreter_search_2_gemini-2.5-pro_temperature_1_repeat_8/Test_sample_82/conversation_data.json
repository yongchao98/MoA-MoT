    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial number of moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is calculated using the formula: Moles = Concentration × Volume.\n*   Initial Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol/L * (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\nThe initial solution is diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid solution) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\nThe new concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n*   New Concentration (Ca) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nThe titration reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O\nAt any point before the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer containing the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO-). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([CH3COO⁻]/[CH3COOH])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa of acetic acid:\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   The ratio [CH3COO⁻]/[CH3COOH] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n\nNow, substitute this ratio into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\nKa = 1.85e-5\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n```\nThe calculation shows that the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base (CH3COO⁻), which hydrolyzes in water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\nCH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n\nFirst, determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. At this point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n*   Moles of acid = 0.001 mol (from Step 1)\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\nNext, calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n*   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n\nNow, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) in the solution:\n*   [CH3COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of OH⁻ produced by the hydrolysis of acetate. We use the Kb for acetate.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n*   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻].\nLet x = [OH⁻] = [CH3COOH]. The equation becomes Kb = x² / [CH3COO⁻].\n*   x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * [CH3COO⁻])\n\nNow, we can calculate the pH.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n# Concentration of acetate at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = 0.02 # M\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Calculate [OH-]\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate] => [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\n# Calculate pH\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\nThe calculation shows that the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation:\n\n**1. Analyze the initial state and dilution:**\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    Concentration = 0.05 M\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol CH₃COOH.\n*   **Dilution:**\n    The initial 20.00 cm³ of acid solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   **Concentration of acetic acid after dilution (this is the starting concentration for the titration):**\n    Concentration (Cₐ) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration:**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   This creates a buffer solution containing a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKₐ + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])\n*   First, calculate pKₐ:\n    pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   The ratio of concentrations [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   pH = pKₐ + log(1/3) = pKₐ - log(3)\n*   Calculating the value:\n    pKₐ ≈ 4.733\n    pH ≈ 4.733 - log(3) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 ≈ 4.26\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point:**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has reacted with an equimolar amount of NaOH.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:**\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   At this point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), in 0.0500 L of water.\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   Acetate is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kₑ, for acetate:\n    Kₑ = Kᵥ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis to find the [OH⁻]:\n    Kₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kₑ is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517 ≈ 8.52.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nThese calculated values match option C.\n\nI will use Python to confirm the calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05 # M\ninitial_acid_vol = 0.020 # L\nadded_water_vol = 0.020 # L\nnaoh_conc = 0.1 # M\n\n# Step 1: Dilution\nmoles_acid = initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol\ndiluted_acid_vol = initial_acid_vol + added_water_vol\ndiluted_acid_conc = moles_acid / diluted_acid_vol\n\n# Step 2: pH at 25% titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Step 3: pH at equivalence point\n# Moles of NaOH needed = moles of acid\nmoles_naoh = moles_acid\n# Volume of NaOH needed\nvol_naoh = moles_naoh / naoh_conc\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_equiv = diluted_acid_vol + vol_naoh\n# Concentration of acetate (A-) at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_equiv\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n\n```\nThe code confirms the manually calculated values. The pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<C>>>",
