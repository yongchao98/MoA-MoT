    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental setup and its results.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (a common gut pathogen).\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, meaning the antigen is introduced into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Observation site:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, a key part of the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Cell population:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. This indicates an active immune response is underway, as antigen presentation leads to the clonal expansion of specific lymphocytes.\n    *   **Key finding:** High variability in the sequenced variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the immunological context:**\n    *   The experiment simulates a mucosal immune response initiated in the gut.\n    *   Peyer's patches are where B cells encounter antigens from the gut lumen.\n    *   Upon activation by an antigen, B cells proliferate and form structures called germinal centers within the Peyer's patches.\n    *   The variable heavy chain gene (part of the VDJ segment) determines the antigen-binding specificity of an antibody.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the key finding (\"high variability in the variable heavy chain gene\"):**\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), not the variable region. It alters the antibody's function but not its specificity. While this process occurs in germinal centers, it doesn't explain the variability in the *variable* gene.\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that is part of the innate and adaptive immune response (when triggered by antibodies). It does not involve any genetic changes in B cells.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers. It introduces point mutations at a very high rate into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose of SHM is to generate B cells with higher affinity receptors for the antigen. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene among the population of proliferating B cells. This perfectly matches the observation.\n    *   **D) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that *initially* assembles the variable region gene in developing B cells in the bone marrow, *before* they encounter an antigen. It creates the initial repertoire of B cells. The process described in the question is happening *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ, in an already mature but now proliferating B cell. Therefore, VDJ recombination has already occurred and is not the process causing the *new* variability during proliferation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
