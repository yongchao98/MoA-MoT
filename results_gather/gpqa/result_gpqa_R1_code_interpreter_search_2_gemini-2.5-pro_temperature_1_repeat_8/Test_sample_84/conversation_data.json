    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its distance from the star. The formula for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A_p)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   a = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n    *   A_p = Planet's albedo (reflectivity)\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant for both. It also specifies that both planets have the same albedo (A_p1 = A_p2). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (2 * a_2 / R_star))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data:** The problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1). We can find this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ).\n\n6.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The maximum observed Doppler shift (Δλ) of a spectral line is caused by the star's maximum radial velocity (K_star) as it \"wobbles\" due to the planet's gravitational pull. The relationship is:\n    Δλ / λ_0 = K_star / c  =>  K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    Where c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. This means K_star is directly proportional to Δλ.\n\n7.  **Radial Velocity and Planet Properties:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's maximum radial velocity (K_star) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital distance (a) by the following formula (assuming M_p << M_star):\n    K_star = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) is the planet's orbital velocity, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    Substituting v_p gives:\n    K_star = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n8.  **Use Transit Information:** The problem states that the planets were also detected by the transit method. A transit can only be observed if the planet's orbit is seen nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1. We can therefore assume sin(i) ≈ 1 for both planets.\n\n9.  **Combine Formulas to Find 'a':** Now we equate the two expressions for K_star:\n    c * (Δλ / λ_0) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n    We need to solve for 'a'. Let's first solve for sqrt(a):\n    sqrt(a) = M_p * sqrt(G / M_star) / (c * Δλ / λ_0)\n    sqrt(a) = (M_p / Δλ) * (λ_0 * sqrt(G / M_star) / c)\n    Since λ_0, G, M_star, and c are constants for the system, we find the proportionality:\n    sqrt(a) ∝ M_p / Δλ\n\n10. **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can now find the ratio sqrt(a_2 / a_1):\n    sqrt(a_2) / sqrt(a_1) = (M_p2 / Δλ_2) / (M_p1 / Δλ_1)\n    sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\n11. **Final Calculation:** From step 4, we know that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1). Therefore:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n12. **Convert to Decimal:** To compare with the given options, we convert the fraction to a decimal.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nMp1_earth = 7.0  # Mass of Planet1 in Earth masses\nMp2_earth = 5.0  # Mass of Planet2 in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet2 in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n# where 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\n# The semi-major axis 'a' is related to the planet mass (Mp) and Doppler shift (delta_lambda) by:\n# sqrt(a) is proportional to Mp / delta_lambda\n# So, sqrt(a2 / a1) = (Mp2 / delta_lambda2) / (Mp1 / delta_lambda1)\n# which simplifies to:\n# sqrt(a2 / a1) = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratios\nMp_ratio = Mp2_earth / Mp1_earth  # Mp2 / Mp1\ndelta_lambda_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 # delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\nT_eq_ratio = Mp_ratio * delta_lambda_ratio\n\nprint(T_eq_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\times (1 - A_p)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A_p$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 ($T_{eq1}$) and Planet2 ($T_{eq2}$), we can set up the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} \\times (1 - A_{p1})^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\times (1 - A_{p2})^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_{p1} = A_{p2}$), so the albedo term also cancels out. The simplified ratio is:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_1}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$). We can determine this from the radial velocity data. The maximum radial velocity ($K_{star}$) of the star due to a planet's gravitational pull is related to the Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by:\n\n$K_{star} = c \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. This means $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude is also given by:\n\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which makes $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nSince $M_{star}$ and $G$ are constants, we can establish the proportionality:\n\n$K_{star} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nCombining our two proportionalities for $K_{star}$, we get:\n\n$\\Delta\\lambda \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nWe can solve for $\\sqrt{a}$:\n\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\Delta\\lambda}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}} = \\frac{M_{p2}/\\Delta\\lambda_2}{M_{p1}/\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSince $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1}$ = 7 Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2}$ = 5 Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1$ = 0.03 Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2$ = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
