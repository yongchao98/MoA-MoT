    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The amount of wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight (v_r). The formula is:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *amplitude* of the periodic wavelength shift. This corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, denoted by K. Therefore, K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    We are given:\n    - Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ for planet #1\n    - Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ for planet #2\n\n    So, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude K of the host star can be expressed by the following formula (assuming the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star):\n    K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3) ) * (M_p * sin(i)) * T^(-1/3)\n    where:\n    - G is the gravitational constant.\n    - M_star is the mass of the star.\n    - M_p is the mass of the planet.\n    - i is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight (i=90° for an edge-on orbit). M_p * sin(i) is the \"minimum mass\" that can be determined from RV measurements.\n    - T is the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Compare the Two Systems:**\n    The problem states:\n    - The stars have the same mass: M_star,1 = M_star,2.\n    - The planets have masses similar to Neptune. In the context of the RV method, this is most reasonably interpreted as the minimum mass (M_p * sin(i)) being the same for both planets. This is because M_p * sin(i) is the quantity directly constrained by the measurement.\n    - Therefore, M_p,1 * sin(i₁) ≈ M_p,2 * sin(i₂).\n\n    Looking at the formula for K, all the terms except for the period T are constant between the two systems.\n    K ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    We can write the relationship between the two systems as a ratio:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the periods, T₂ / T₁. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    (K₂ / K₁)^3 = T₁ / T₂\n    T₂ / T₁ = (K₂ / K₁)^(-3) = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\n    Now, substitute the known ratio of the K values:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n    T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To get the numerical answer, we calculate (5/7)³.\n    T₂ / T₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343\n\n    Let's perform the division to compare with the given options.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio T2/T1\nratio_K = 5/7\nperiod_ratio = ratio_K**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity.**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines. The change in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight (v_r). The maximum periodic shift in wavelength (given as 5 mÅ and 7 mÅ) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, which is denoted by K.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Radial Velocity Amplitude (K).**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the host star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3) ) * (M_p * sin(i)) * T^(-1/3)\n    where:\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n    *   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n    *   `T` is the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Identify the constants between the two systems.**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_star,1 = M_star,2`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses. In the RV method, the quantity that is actually constrained is the \"minimum mass\", `M_p * sin(i)`. It is standard to assume this is the quantity being referred to as similar. So, `(M_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (M_p * sin(i))₂`.\n    *   `G` and `2π` are universal constants.\n\n4.  **Establish the proportionality between K and T.**\n    Since all other terms in the equation are the same for both systems, we can see the relationship between the velocity amplitude (K) and the orbital period (T):\n    K ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Set up a ratio to solve for the periods.**\n    We can write the relationship for our two systems as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio `T₂ / T₁`. To do this, we can rearrange the equation:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (K₂ / K₁)^(-3) = (K₁ / K₂ )³\n\n6.  **Substitute the known values and calculate.**\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5, which means K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n    Now, substitute this into our rearranged formula:\n    T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    T₂ / T₁ = 5³ / 7³\n    T₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\n\n    Calculating the decimal value:\n    T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
