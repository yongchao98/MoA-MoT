    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Black Body (Stefan-Boltzmann Law):** The luminosity (L) of a star behaving as a black body is given by $L = \\sigma A T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area ($A = 4\\pi R^2$), and T is the surface temperature.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength of a Black Body (Wien's Displacement Law):** The wavelength at which a black body's emission spectrum peaks ($\\lambda_{em,peak}$) is inversely proportional to its temperature: $\\lambda_{em,peak} = b/T$, where b is Wien's displacement constant. This law applies to the radiation as it is emitted from the star (i.e., in its own rest frame).\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$). For a radial velocity $v_r$, the non-relativistic formula is $z = v_r/c = (\\lambda_{obs} - \\lambda_{em})/\\lambda_{em}$, which rearranges to $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$. A positive $v_r$ (moving away) causes a redshift (longer wavelength), and a negative $v_r$ (moving closer) causes a blueshift (shorter wavelength).\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (\\sigma * 4\\pi R_1^2 * T_1^4) / (\\sigma * 4\\pi R_2^2 * T_2^4)$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information for the Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$, so the radius ratio is $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    *   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars **appeared brightest**... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs,peak}$). So, $\\lambda_{obs,peak,1} = \\lambda_{obs,peak,2}$.\n    *   We must relate these observed wavelengths to the stars' temperatures using the Doppler effect and Wien's Law.\n    *   For Star_1: The radial velocity $v_{r1} = 0$. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift. The observed peak wavelength is the same as the emitted peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,peak,1} = \\lambda_{em,peak,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: The radial velocity $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. The observed peak wavelength is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,peak,2} = \\lambda_{em,peak,2} * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,peak,1} = \\lambda_{obs,peak,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{em,peak,1} = \\lambda_{em,peak,2} * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Now, apply Wien's Law ($\\lambda_{em,peak} = b/T$):\n        $b/T_1 = (b/T_2) * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Simplify to find the temperature ratio:\n        $1/T_1 = (1/T_2) * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n        $T_2/T_1 = 1 + v_{r2}/c$\n        $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    *   Now, we need to calculate the value using the provided data. This is a good place to use a script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nv2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the redshift, z, for Star_2\nz2 = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio T1/T2\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + z2)\nT1_over_T2 = 1 / (1 + z2)\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio L1/L2\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.229103980388277\n</execute_code>\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. This value rounds to 2.23. The extraneous information about the mass is a distractor, as the problem specifies the stars radiate as black bodies. Comparing our result to the given options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.23\n    C) ~2.35\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    Our calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n1.  **Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4$\n    where A is the surface area ($A = 4\\pi R^2$), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We can set up the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into our equation gives:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:** To find the temperature ratio, we use the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{em,peak}$): $\\lambda_{em,peak} = b/T$, where b is Wien's constant. This is the wavelength in the star's own rest frame.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,peak,1} = \\lambda_{obs,peak,2}$.\n    *   The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler effect: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Applying Doppler and Wien's Law:**\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$. There is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{obs,peak,1} = \\lambda_{em,peak,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. The light is redshifted, so $\\lambda_{obs,peak,2} = \\lambda_{em,peak,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal:\n        $\\lambda_{em,peak,1} = \\lambda_{em,peak,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Now, substitute using Wien's Law ($ \\lambda_{em,peak} = b/T $):\n        $b/T_1 = (b/T_2) * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Cancel 'b' and rearrange to find the temperature ratio:\n        $T_2/T_1 = 1 + v_{r2}/c$\n        $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    The python script calculated this value precisely.\n\n    Using the output from the code execution:\n    `luminosity_ratio = 2.229107561148499`\n\n    Rounding this value to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. This matches option B. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
