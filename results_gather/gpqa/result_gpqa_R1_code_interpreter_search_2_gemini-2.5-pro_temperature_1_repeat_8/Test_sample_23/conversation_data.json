    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let's determine the empirical formula of Z. The mass fraction of carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   The ratio of moles of Hydrogen to Carbon is: (14.28 / 1.008) : (85.72 / 12.01) ≈ 14.17 : 7.14 ≈ 2:1.\n    *   The empirical formula is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z is the result of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, which means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Saturated acyclic hydrocarbons have the formula CnH2n+2. The mass fraction of H would be (2n+2)/(14n+2). For n>1, this is always less than (2*1+2)/(14*1+2) = 4/16 = 25% and decreases as n increases.\n    *   Saturated cyclic hydrocarbons (cycloalkanes) have the formula CnH2n. The mass fraction of H is (2n)/(14n) = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which is 14.2857%. This perfectly matches the given value of 14.28%.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids (A and B). It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids (C and D). It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation, which is an internal redox reaction where some molecules are oxidized (lose H) and others are reduced (gain H).\n    *   Hydrogenation of both X (A, B) and Y (C, D) gives only Z. This is a crucial clue: it means A, B, C, and D must all have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say D = Z.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water and Z is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n), the other component C must also be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of C must also yield Z (CnH2n). If C were a saturated isomer of Z, the reaction would involve skeletal rearrangement. A much more common and plausible scenario in this context is that C is the aromatic analogue of the cycloalkane Z. An aromatic ring requires more severe conditions to hydrogenate, which aligns with the problem statement (\"rather severe conditions\").\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of an aromatic compound (C) and a cycloalkane (Z=D).\n    *   The most common and simple examples of this aromatic/cycloalkane pair with the same carbon skeleton are Benzene (C₆H₆) / Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) or Toluene (C₇H₈) / Methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄). Both cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane are widely used solvents. Let's analyze the C₆ case as it's the most fundamental example.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis: The C₆ System**\n    *   Let's assume Z is **Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits CnH2n and is a very common solvent.\n    *   Mixture Y must be {Aromatic C, Cyclohexane}. The aromatic compound with a C₆ ring is **Benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, **Y = {Benzene (C₆H₆), Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)}**. This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Benzene does not readily react with bromine water, and cyclohexane is saturated, so Y does not decolorize bromine water. This fits.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is: A + B → C + D, or **A + B → Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n    *   Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture X (A+B) and results in an equimolar mixture Y (C+D), the stoichiometry must be 1:1 → 1:1.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the total in one molecule of benzene and one of cyclohexane.\n        *   Total atoms in products = (C₆H₆) + (C₆H₁₂) = C₁₂H₁₈.\n        *   Therefore, total atoms in reactants = A + B = C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   A and B are two different liquids in mixture X. They must both have a C₆ carbon skeleton (to hydrogenate to cyclohexane). So, A = C₆Hx and B = C₆Hy.\n    *   From the atom balance, x + y = 18.\n    *   We also know from the problem statement:\n        *   A and B decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated).\n        *   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's find suitable C₆ unsaturated molecules. The possibilities with a six-membered ring are Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈).\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated bonds, so it is excluded.\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)** does not have conjugated bonds.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** has one double bond.\n    *   Let's test if these two molecules fit our condition x + y = 18.\n        *   Number of hydrogens in Cyclohexene = 10.\n        *   Number of hydrogens in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene = 8.\n        *   Sum = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   This is a perfect match. So, mixture X consists of Cyclohexene and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₀) + (H atoms in C₆H₈) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis solution is self-consistent and all conditions of the problem are met. (Note: A similar analysis for the C₇ system would lead to a total of 22 hydrogen atoms, which is also an option. However, the C₆ system involving benzene/cyclohexane is the most fundamental and common textbook example of this type of chemistry, making it the most probable intended answer).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
