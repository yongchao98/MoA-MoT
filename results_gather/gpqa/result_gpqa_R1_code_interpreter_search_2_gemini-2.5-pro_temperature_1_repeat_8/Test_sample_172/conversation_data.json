    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the core principles:** The problem involves uncertainty in position (Δx) and asks for the corresponding uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This points to two key concepts:\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle connects the uncertainty in a particle's position to the uncertainty in its momentum. The most common form states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum along that same axis (Δp_x) has a minimum value.\n        *   Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2\n        *   Here, ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, which is h / (2π) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n    *   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** This relates a particle's total energy (E) to its momentum (p). For a particle with velocity v, the change in energy (ΔE) is related to the change in momentum (Δp) by the following expression (which holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases):\n        *   ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x\n        *   (This is derived from E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)² by differentiating, dE/dp = v).\n\n2.  **Formulate the equation:** We want to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE_min). To do this, we first find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_x,min) from the Heisenberg principle.\n    *   From Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:\n        *   Δp_x,min = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n    *   Now, substitute this into the energy uncertainty relation:\n        *   ΔE_min ≈ v * Δp_x,min\n        *   ΔE_min = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\n3.  **List the given values and constants:**\n    *   Velocity of the electron, v = 2 * 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Now, we plug the values into the formula.
