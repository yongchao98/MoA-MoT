    "This problem requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer upon electrophilic bromination. The yield of the para-isomer depends on the nature of the substituent already on the benzene ring. Substituents can be classified based on their activating/deactivating and directing effects.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing. Electrophilic substitution on rings with ortho,para-directing groups will yield significant amounts of the para-isomer, while rings with meta-directing groups will yield very little para-isomer.\n\n*   **Substituents on the ring:**\n    1.  **-CH3 (Toluene):** Alkyl group. It is electron-donating (activating) and **ortho,para-directing**.\n    2.  **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** Ester group. It is electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and **meta-directing**.\n    3.  **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogen. It is electron-withdrawing (deactivating) but is **ortho,para-directing** due to resonance.\n    4.  **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** Nitro group. It is strongly electron-withdrawing (strongly deactivating) and **meta-directing**.\n    5.  **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** Alkyl group. It is electron-donating (activating) and **ortho,para-directing**.\n    6.  **-COOH (Benzoic acid):** Carboxylic acid group. It is electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and **meta-directing**.\n\n*   **Grouping:**\n    *   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** 2 (-COOC2H5), 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH)\n    *   **High para-yield group (ortho,para-directors):** 1 (-CH3), 3 (-Cl), 5 (-C2H5)\n\nThe final order will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing compounds (2, 4, 6).**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group more effectively neutralizes the electron density at the ortho and para positions, making meta-substitution more favorable and o/p substitution less favorable.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n    **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\n    **C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)**\n    (Typical para-yields: Nitrobenzene ~1%, Benzoic acid ~1-2%, Ethyl benzoate ~4%)\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho,para-directing compounds (1, 3, 5).**\n\nFor ortho,para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by both electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile (bromine) to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. Consequently, a higher proportion of the substitution occurs at the sterically unhindered para position for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the para-yield order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n    (Typical para-yields: Toluene ~67%, Ethylbenzene >67%)\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups with -Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating overall, they are ortho,para-directing. The strong inductive electron-withdrawal by chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with some steric hindrance and lone-pair repulsion, leads to a very high preference for para substitution. The para-isomer yield for chlorobenzene is typically higher than for alkylbenzenes like toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the para-yield of chlorobenzene is the highest in this group.\n    (Typical para-yield: Chlorobenzene ~89%)\n\n*   Combining these findings, the order of increasing para-yield for the o,p-directors is:\n    **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups.**\n\nNow we combine the ordered lists from Step 2 and Step 3. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho,para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
