    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n**1. The Setup**\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V=0) everywhere on its surface. The presence of the charge `q` induces a distribution of surface charge on the sphere to maintain this zero potential.\n\n**2. The Method of Images**\nThe electric field outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges, is identical to the field created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The grounded sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\nThe properties of the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface of radius `R` is zero. Standard derivations show that:\n\n*   The image charge is: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   The position of the image charge is: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the real charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A crucial point in electrostatics is that the energy of a charge `q` in the field of an induced charge distribution (like on our conductor) is given by:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge distribution itself is created by `q`, and the energy is stored in the electric field of the combined system.\n\nIn our image charge model, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n**4. Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Find the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`:**\n    The real charge is at `d` from the center, and the image charge is at `b = R^2/d` from the center, along the same line.\n    Distance = `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n*   **Calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:**\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Calculate the total potential energy `U` of the system:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis expression represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the sphere is attractive, so the system has lower energy than when the charge is at infinity (where U=0).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nOur derived formula `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
