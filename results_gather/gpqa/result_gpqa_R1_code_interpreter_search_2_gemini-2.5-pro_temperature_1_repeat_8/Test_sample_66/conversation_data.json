    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and basis:**\n    The system of two electrons is initially in a coupled angular momentum state, described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. This is the \"coupled basis\".\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (since it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement and the final state basis:**\n    A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. The eigenstates of these operators are the \"uncoupled basis\" kets, represented as $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$ or more simply as $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1.\n    *   $m_{l1}$ is the magnetic quantum number for electron 1, with possible values {-1, 0, 1}.\n    *   $m_{l2}$ is the magnetic quantum number for electron 2, with possible values {-1, 0, 1}.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific outcome of the measurement:**\n    We want to find the probability of the outcome where the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    So, we are interested in the probability of finding the system in the final state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1>$, which can be written as $|1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics:**\n    The probability of obtaining a specific outcome is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state.\n    Probability $P = | <\\text{final state} | \\text{initial state}> |^2$.\n    In our notation: $P = | <1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> |^2$.\n\n5.  **Use the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum:**\n    A crucial concept in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    This means the quantum numbers are related by: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator $L_z$ with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n    The final state we are considering, $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, corresponds to measuring $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$. For this state, the total z-component quantum number is $m_{total} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    For the transition from the initial state to this final state to be possible, the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved. We must have $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    In our case, the initial state has $m=-1$, and the desired final state has a total z-component of $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$.\n    Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the transition is forbidden.\n\n6.  **Formal interpretation using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:**\n    The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    Since this condition is violated (as $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    Substituting this back into the probability formula:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
