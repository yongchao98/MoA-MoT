    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical System and Identify the Radiation Type\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. This system radiates electromagnetic waves. To determine the properties of this radiation, we need to model the source.\n\nIn electromagnetism, radiation from a time-varying charge and current distribution is described by a multipole expansion. The main terms are electric dipole (E1), magnetic dipole (M1), electric quadrupole (E2), and so on. For a source whose size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation (`d << λ`), the electric dipole term is typically the most dominant, unless it is forbidden by the symmetry of the oscillation.\n\nAn \"oscillating charge distribution\" is a general term. The simplest and most common physical realization is an oscillating electric dipole, where the center of positive charge oscillates with respect to the center of negative charge. For an oscillation along the z-axis, this creates an oscillating electric dipole moment `**p**(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) **ẑ**`. The spheroid shape can be considered the volume containing this oscillating charge. This is the most fundamental model for a radiating source and is the most likely interpretation in a general physics problem.\n\nTherefore, we will model the source as an oscillating electric dipole along the z-axis.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\nThe formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) from an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude, frequency, and fundamental constants.\n\nThe function `f(λ, θ)` in the problem is this power per unit solid angle. So, `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. First, we calculate the power at this angle:\n`(dP/dΩ)_θ=30° ∝ sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power `A`:\n`Fraction = [(dP/dΩ)_θ=30°] / A = (k * sin²(30°)) / (k * sin²(90°)) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\nThis determines the first part of the answer.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\nNow, we look at the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`. The full formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\nHere, `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation.\n\nThe power is proportional to `ω⁴`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula:\n`ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`\nwhere `f` is the frequency and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n`Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, the function `f(λ, θ)` which represents the power per unit solid angle, must be proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is the famous wavelength dependence for Rayleigh scattering, which is a result of dipole radiation.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option\nFrom our analysis:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1/4, λ⁻³\nB) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nC) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\nD) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\nOur derived result matches option B.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Alternative Consideration): One might wonder if the source is an electric quadrupole, as shape oscillations of a spheroid can lead to quadrupole radiation. In that case, `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and `Power ∝ λ⁻⁶`. This would lead to a fraction of `3/4` and a `λ⁻⁶` dependence (Option D). However, without specific information forcing a quadrupole model (like a forbidden dipole transition or explicitly stated shape oscillation), the electric dipole is the assumed, fundamental radiation mechanism.*\n\nBased on the most standard and fundamental model, the answer is derived from electric dipole radiation characteristics.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Calculate the fraction of maximum power at theta = 30 degrees\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# The angular dependence for electric dipole radiation is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power is at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\n# The fraction at 30 degrees is sin^2(30) / sin^2(90).\n\n# sin(30 degrees) = 0.5\nfraction = (math.sin(math.radians(theta_deg)))**2\n\n# The calculation gives 0.5^2 = 0.25, which is 1/4.\n\n# Part 2: Wavelength dependence\n# The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (omega^4).\n# Since omega is proportional to 1/lambda, the power is proportional to (1/lambda)^4, which is lambda^(-4).\n\nprint(f\"Fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees: {fraction}\")\nprint(\"Wavelength dependence: lambda^(-4)\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An oscillating electric charge distribution, particularly one with a defined axis of symmetry for its oscillation (the z-axis), is modeled as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole with its moment aligned along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\nThe function `f` in the problem represents this quantity, so `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation).\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max`.\n\nWe need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°` as a fraction of this maximum power `A`.\nThe power at `θ = 30°` is `(dP/dΩ)_30° ∝ sin²(30°)`.\n\nThe value of `sin(30°)` is `1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power is the ratio:\n`Fraction = (dP/dΩ)_30° / A = (k * sin²(30°)) / (k * sin²(90°)) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which shows that the power is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charge. For a sinusoidal oscillation, the acceleration is proportional to the square of the angular frequency `ω`. Therefore, the power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n\n`Power ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\nSubstituting this into the power relationship:\n`Power ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, the function `f` must have a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n- The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n- A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
