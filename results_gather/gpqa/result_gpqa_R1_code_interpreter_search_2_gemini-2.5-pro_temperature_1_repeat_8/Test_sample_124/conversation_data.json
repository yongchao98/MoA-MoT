    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the System and Hamiltonian\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, this is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian for this system is:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\n\nThis Hamiltonian is separable in Cartesian coordinates. It can be written as the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by:\n$E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of $n$:\n*   **Ground State:** $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that result in the same principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\nThis is a problem of distributing $n=3$ identical items (energy quanta) into $k=3$ distinct bins (the Cartesian dimensions). The formula for this is:\nDegeneracy $g_n = \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \\binom{n+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{n+2}{2} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$\n\nWe can also list the combinations explicitly:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n*   (1, 1, 1) and its permutations: (1,1,1) — 1 state\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is equal to its degeneracy.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions (the degeneracy) is 10.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (9/2) ħω, 10\nB) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3\nC) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10\nD) (9/2) ħω, 3\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
