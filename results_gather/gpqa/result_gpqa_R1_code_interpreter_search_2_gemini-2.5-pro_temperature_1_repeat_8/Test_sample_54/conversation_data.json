    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **Signal 1:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n*   **Signal 2:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 3:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 4:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O). This suggests the presence of an acetyl group (CH₃-C(=O)-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the acetyl group fragment, -O-C(=O)-CH₃. All four options are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates another methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, suggesting the methyl group is attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This suggests a `CH₃-CH=` fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 1 & 2: Alkene Protons**\n    *   **Signals:** 7.0 ppm (1H) and 5.5 ppm (1H). These chemical shifts are in the vinylic region, confirming the presence of a C=C double bond. The 1H integration for each means the double bond is disubstituted with one proton on each carbon, i.e., a `-CH=CH-` system.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant J = 16.0 Hz. In 1H NMR, the magnitude of the coupling constant between two vinylic protons is diagnostic of the double bond's stereochemistry:\n        *   **Trans coupling:** J is typically large, around 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis coupling:** J is typically smaller, around 6-12 Hz.\n    *   Since J = 16.0 Hz, this strongly indicates that the two protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration. This immediately eliminates the *cis* options (B and C).\n\n**2. Assembling the Structure**\n\nWe have the following pieces:\n*   An acetyl group: `-O-C(=O)-CH₃` (from signal 3)\n*   A trans double bond with a methyl group attached: `CH₃-CH=CH-` (from signals 1, 2, and 4)\n\nCombining these pieces gives the structure of **trans-propenyl acetate**:\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n\nLet's check if the splitting patterns match this proposed structure:\n*   **Protons (d) at ~2.1 ppm:** The acetyl methyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it should be a **singlet (s)**. This matches the data.\n*   **Protons (a) at ~1.6 ppm:** The methyl group on the double bond. It is adjacent to one proton, H(b). According to the n+1 rule, it should be split into a **doublet (d)**. This matches the data.\n*   **Proton (c) at ~7.0 ppm:** This vinylic proton is adjacent to the electronegative oxygen, which deshields it, shifting it far downfield. It is coupled only to proton H(b). Therefore, it should be a **doublet (d)**. This matches the data.\n*   **Proton (b) at ~5.5 ppm:** This vinylic proton is coupled to two different sets of protons:\n    1.  Proton H(c) (1 proton): This coupling will split the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    2.  The methyl group CH₃(a) (3 protons): This coupling will split the signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n    *   The resulting multiplicity is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This matches the data.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) Trans-butenyl acetate & C) Cis-butenyl acetate:** A butenyl group (`CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-`) would have an ethyl group, not a methyl group, attached to the double bond. This would result in different signals (e.g., a 2H multiplet for the -CH₂- group and a 3H triplet for the terminal -CH₃ group) and different splitting patterns for the vinylic protons. The given data, with two distinct methyl signals (3H each), is inconsistent with a butenyl structure.\n*   **B) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This structure would show the same number of signals with the same integrations and splitting patterns. However, the coupling constant between the vinylic protons would be in the 6-12 Hz range, not 16.0 Hz.\n*   **D) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the 1H NMR data: the number of signals, their chemical shifts, their integrations, and especially the multiplicities and the large trans-coupling constant.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence, particularly the J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz and the specific splitting patterns, points unequivocally to Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
