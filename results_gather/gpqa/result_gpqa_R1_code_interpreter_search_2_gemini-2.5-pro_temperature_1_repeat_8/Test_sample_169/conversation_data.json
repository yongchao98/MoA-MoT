    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the given quantum state.**\n    The electron is in the spin state represented by the vector `(3i, 4)`. In quantum mechanics, this is represented as a \"ket\" vector:\n    `|ψ> = [3i, 4]^T` (written as a column vector).\n\n2.  **Understand the concept of expectation value.**\n    The expectation value of an observable (like spin) represented by an operator `A` for a quantum state `|ψ>` is the average value of the observable that would be measured if the system is in that state. The formula for the expectation value `<A>` is:\n    `<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n    where `<ψ|` is the \"bra\" vector, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|ψ>`, and `<ψ|ψ>` is the inner product of the state with itself, used for normalization.\n\n3.  **Define the operator for the spin along the y-direction (S_y).**\n    The spin operator `S_y` is related to the corresponding Pauli matrix `σ_y` by the formula:\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    The problem gives the Pauli-y matrix `σ_y`:\n    `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the components of the expectation value formula.**\n    *   **Find the bra vector `<ψ|`:**\n        Take the transpose of `|ψ>` and then the complex conjugate of each element.\n        `|ψ> = [3i, 4]^T`\n        Transpose: `[3i, 4]`\n        Complex conjugate: `[-3i, 4]`\n        So, `<ψ| = [-3i, 4]`.\n\n    *   **Calculate the normalization factor `<ψ|ψ>` (the denominator):**\n        `<ψ|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n        `<ψ|ψ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n        `<ψ|ψ> = -9i² + 16`\n        Since `i² = -1`:\n        `<ψ|ψ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`.\n\n    *   **Calculate the numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`:**\n        We need to compute `<ψ| * S_y * |ψ>`.\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = <ψ| * ( (ħ/2) * σ_y ) * |ψ>`\n        Let's pull the constant `(ħ/2)` out:\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * <ψ|σ_y|ψ>`\n        Now, let's compute the matrix product `σ_y|ψ>` first:\n        `σ_y|ψ> = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n        `= [ (0 * 3i) + (-i * 4), (i * 3i) + (0 * 4) ]^T`\n        `= [ -4i, 3i² ]^T`\n        `= [ -4i, -3 ]^T` (since `i² = -1`)\n\n        Now, multiply this result by `<ψ|`:\n        `<ψ|(σ_y|ψ)> = [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T`\n        `= (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)`\n        `= 12i² - 12`\n        `= 12(-1) - 12`\n        `= -12 - 12 = -24`\n\n        Therefore, the full numerator is:\n        `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ`.\n\n5.  **Compute the final expectation value `<S_y>`**\n    `<S_y> = <ψ|S_y|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\n    `<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis corresponds to `-12*hbar/25`.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the unnormalized spin state vector\n# In Python, the imaginary unit 'i' is represented as 'j'\npsi = np.array([3j, 4])\n\n# Define the Pauli-Y matrix\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j],\n                    [1j,  0]])\n\n# The spin operator S_y is (hbar/2) * sigma_y.
