    "**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael Addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The structure has a carbonyl group at C1.\n    *   At C2, there is an ethyl group and a methyl group. This carbon is quaternary and has no α-protons.\n    *   At C6, there is a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   The bulky base, t-BuOK, can only abstract the single available α-proton from the C6 position. This forms a regiochemically defined enolate between C1 and C6.\n\n    ```\n        O                           O(-)\n       //                          /\n    C1--C2(Et)(Me) --(t-BuOK)--> C1==C6(Me)\n    |   |                        |   |\n  C6(Me)-C5                      C2(Et)(Me)-C5\n    \\  /                          \\  /\n     C4--C3                        C4--C3\n    ```\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate (nucleophile) attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), which is the Michael acceptor. The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n    *   `Enolate-C6` attacks `CH₂=CH(β)-COOEt`.\n    *   After the attack and subsequent protonation during workup, a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to C6 of the original ketone.\n\n4.  **Product Structure (A):** The resulting product has the following structure: The cyclohexanone ring now has a carbonyl at C1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, a methyl group at C6, and the newly added `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n      C1--C2(Et)(Me)\n      |   |\n    C6(Me)(CH₂CH₂COOEt) - C5\n      \\  /\n       C4--C3\n    ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** IUPAC nomenclature for substituted rings can be complex. Let's analyze the names given in the options by numbering the ring in the product.\n    *   The options name the product as a substituted `cyclohexyl` group on an ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's analyze the name from options B and D: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n        *   This name implies the propanoate chain is attached to C1 of the cyclohexyl ring. Let's renumber our product structure according to this rule.\n        *   The point of attachment (our original C6) becomes the new C1.\n        *   The original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes the new C2.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl) becomes the new C3.\n    *   With this new numbering, the product has:\n        *   The `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` chain and a methyl group on C1.\n        *   An oxo group (=O) on C2.\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group on C3.\n    *   This perfectly matches the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. Therefore, this is the correct name for product A.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael Addition. KOH is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The structure of but-2-enenitrile is `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The β-carbon (relative to the -CN group) is C3, which bears a methyl group.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻` + `CH₃(β)-CH=CH-CN` → `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH⁻-CN`\n    *   Protonation by water yields the final product.\n\n4.  **Product Structure (B):** The final product is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:** We need to find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon and name it as a nitrile.\n    *   The chain is: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon (C1), we have a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This matches options B and D.\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This matches options C and D.\n\nBoth products match the descriptions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
