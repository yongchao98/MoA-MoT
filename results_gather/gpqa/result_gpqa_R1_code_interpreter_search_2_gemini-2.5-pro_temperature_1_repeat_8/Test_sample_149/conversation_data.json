    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO) using NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: `(2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2 = (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5`. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 ring + 3 double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is the signal for the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d) because it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, which often leads to a broad signal.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring substituted at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Putting these pieces together, the starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = **C8H9NO**. This matches the given formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   Product after Step 1: **2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride**.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O, Heat (Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt)**\n    *   The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas). When heated in water, it is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Product after Step 2: **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   This step involves the self-condensation of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde in the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat. This is a classic aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   **a) Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton (from the -CH2- group) of one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product.\n        *   Intermediate Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n\n    *   **b) Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is performed with **heat**, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings.\n        *   Final Product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure corresponds to option D.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde into 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The presence of heat in the final step ensures that the reaction proceeds to the final, dehydrated condensation product rather than stopping at the aldol addition intermediate. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
