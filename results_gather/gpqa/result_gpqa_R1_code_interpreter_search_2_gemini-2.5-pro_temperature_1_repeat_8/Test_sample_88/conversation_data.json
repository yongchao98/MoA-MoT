    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n2.  **Reagents:** Excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n3.  **Analysis:** This reaction involves a polycyclic halide with a strong base at high temperatures. Such harsh conditions are known to induce rearrangements. A well-documented reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions (e.g., with aqueous NaOH or KOH in ethylene glycol at ~200°C) is a rearrangement and hydrolysis to form **2-adamantanone** (also known as adamantone).\n\n4.  **Examine the Provided Spectral Data:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. Adamantone has a characteristic ketone C=O stretch around 1715-1720 cm⁻¹, which is consistent.\n    *   **1H NMR:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H).\n    *   **Conflict:** The provided 1H NMR spectrum is inconsistent with the structure of adamantone. The 1H NMR spectrum of adamantone shows signals around δ 2.7 (2H, bridgehead α-protons), δ 2.1 (8H), and δ 1.9 (4H). There are no signals in the vinylic region (~4.8 ppm). The signal at 4.79 ppm suggests a C=C double bond, which cannot exist in a stable adamantane cage (Bredt's rule). Furthermore, the ozonolysis step (Step 3) requires a C=C bond. This implies that the reaction does *not* produce adamantone, but another product that has a C=C bond.\n\n5.  **Revisiting the Reaction:** The formation of a product with a C=C bond from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under these conditions is chemically problematic but necessary for the subsequent ozonolysis step. The NMR data indicates the presence of a symmetrical C=C bond (-CH=CH-) because the two vinylic protons (2H at 4.79 ppm) are equivalent. Let's assume this unusual Product 1 is formed and proceed with the reaction sequence. So, Product 1 is a ketone with a C=C bond.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. It specifically reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Product 2 is the alcohol corresponding to the ketone in Product 1. Since Product 1 had a C=C bond, Product 2 is an **unsaturated alcohol**. The C=C bond is not affected by this reaction. The molecular formula changes from C10H14O (Product 1) to C10H16O (Product 2).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction. It cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones). Since the double bond in Product 1 (and thus Product 2) was of the form -CH=CH-, its cleavage will result in the formation of two aldehyde (-CHO) groups.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Product 3 is a **dialdehyde** formed by cleaving the ring of the unsaturated alcohol (Product 2). The alcohol group remains intact. So, Product 3 is a hydroxy-dialdehyde.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Proton in Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3, excluding the exchangeable -OH proton. In a hydroxy-dialdehyde, the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the **aldehyde protons** (H-C=O), which typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling:** The splitting pattern of an aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon). This is a 3-bond coupling (³J).\n    *   If the α-carbon is a CH group, the aldehyde proton signal is a doublet.\n    *   If the α-carbon is a CH₂ group, the aldehyde proton signal is a triplet.\n    *   If the α-carbon has no protons, the aldehyde proton signal is a singlet.\n\n3.  **Long-Range Coupling in Rigid Systems:** In rigid polycyclic systems like those derived from adamantane, long-range couplings (4-bond or 5-bond) can be significant, especially through a \"W\" shaped arrangement of bonds. This can lead to more complex splitting patterns.\n\n4.  **Revisiting the Contradiction:** We have a major conflict. The standard, well-known reaction leads to adamantone (no C=C), which makes the ozonolysis step impossible. The provided NMR data suggests a product with a C=C bond, which is necessary for ozonolysis, but whose formation is chemically obscure.\n\n5.  **A Path to Resolution:** Let's assume the question is designed to test knowledge of the adamantane system's chemistry and spectroscopy, and that the provided NMR for Product 1 is an error intended to mislead. Let's follow the most chemically sound pathway.\n    *   **Product 1 = 2-Adamantanone.**\n    *   **Product 2 = 2-Adamantanol** (from MPV reduction).\n    *   **Product 3 = 2-Adamantanol** (ozonolysis has no effect on a saturated molecule).\n\n6.  **Final Analysis (assuming Product 3 = 2-Adamantanol):**\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In 2-adamantanol, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (H-C-OH). This is the proton at position 2 (H-2). Its chemical shift is around δ 3.8-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling of H-2:** The adamantane cage is very rigid. H-2 is coupled to its neighbors.\n        *   **Vicinal Coupling (³J):** H-2 is adjacent to two bridgehead protons, H-1 and H-3. Due to a plane of symmetry in 2-adamantanol, H-1 and H-3 are chemically equivalent. Coupling to these two equivalent protons will split the H-2 signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** In the rigid chair-like structure of the adamantane cage, H-2 is in a \"W\" arrangement with two equatorial protons on other rings (e.g., H-8eq and H-10eq). This W-coupling is significant in adamantane systems. These two protons are also equivalent by symmetry. Coupling to these two additional equivalent protons will split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n    *   **Resulting Pattern:** The overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis pathway provides a coherent explanation that resolves the contradictions and leads to one of the given answers. The initial spectral data for Product 1 appears to be erroneous.\n\n<<<B>>>"
