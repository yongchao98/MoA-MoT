    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the **enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f)** of the organic molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe overall reaction for the formation of this compound is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy of formation using a Hess's Law cycle involving the atomization of reactants and products. The formula is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the compound)]**\n\n**2. Analyze the Molecule's Structure and Composition:**\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula and count the number of each type of bond in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2**C**=: 1 C\n    *   2 x **C**H3: 2 C\n    *   =**C**H-: 1 C\n    *   -**C**H2-: 1 C\n    *   -**C**H(CH3)-: 1 C\n    *   -CH(**C**H3)-: 1 C\n    *   -**C**H2-: 1 C\n    *   -**C**H=: 1 C\n    *   =**C**(CH3)2: 1 C\n    *   =C(**C**H3)2: 2 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 12.\n\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (C**H3**)2C=: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   =C**H**-: 1 H\n    *   -C**H2**-: 2 H\n    *   -C**H**(CH3)-: 1 H\n    *   -CH(C**H3**)-: 3 H\n    *   -C**H2**-: 2 H\n    *   -C**H**=: 1 H\n    *   =C(C**H3**)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22.\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Count the bonds:** By drawing the structure and ensuring each carbon has 4 bonds, we can count the types of bonds:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=CH**- and -**CH=C**(CH3)2. So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** The carbon skeleton has 12 atoms. An acyclic structure with 12 carbon atoms and 2 double bonds will have 12 - 1 = 11 total C-C/C=C links. Since 2 of them are double bonds, there must be 11 - 2 = **9 C-C single bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound:**\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\nΔH_atom(compound) = (9 × BE(C-C)) + (2 × BE(C=C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\nUsing the given values:\nΔH_atom(compound) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n(This corresponds to option B, which is a potential distractor as it's not the enthalpy of formation).\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements:**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) to gaseous atoms.\nThe process is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\n*   For Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   For Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    Energy = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):**\nUsing the formula from Step 1:\nΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the compound)]\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options:**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. This doesn't match options A or B directly. Options C and D are in units of kJ/g. We need to convert our answer to these units.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass:**\n    Molar Mass (M) of C12H22 = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    Using integer masses for simplicity (as is common in such problems with rounded data):\n    M = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:**\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol\n\nLet's perform this final calculation.\n```python\n# Final calculation to convert kJ/mol to kJ/g\ndelta_H_f_mol = 1900  # kJ/mol\nmolar_mass = 166  # g/mol\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass\nprint(delta_H_f_gram)\n```\n\n11.44578313253012\n\nThe result is approximately 11.45 kJ/g.\n\n**7. Final Answer Selection:**\nThe calculated value of ~11.45 kJ/g matches option C (11.44 kJ/g) very closely.\n\n*   A) 67.4 kJ/mol - Incorrect.\n*   B) 11200 kJ/mol - Incorrect (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g - Correct.\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g - Incorrect units.\n\n<<<C>>>",
