    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered ring with one double bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH). Let's place it at position 1.\n    *   A `formyl` group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position 5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula (C_x H_y O_z):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = **3 oxygens**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   On the ring: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) -> 7 H\n    *   On substituents: -COOH(1H), -CHO(1H), -CH=CH2(3H) -> 5 H\n    *   Total H = 7 + 5 = **12 hydrogens**.\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C10H12O3**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the structure or the formula.\n*   **From the structure:**\n    *   1 for the ring.\n    *   1 for the C=C bond in the ring.\n    *   1 for the C=C bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   1 for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid.\n    *   1 for the C=O bond in the formyl group.\n    *   Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n\n*   **From the formula (IHD = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2):**\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**.\nBoth methods give an IHD of 5 for the starting material.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces aldehydes and ketones to alkanes.\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids to alkanes.\n*   It reduces alcohols to alkanes.\n*   It reduces alkenes and alkynes to alkanes.\n\nEssentially, it removes all oxygen atoms (from carbonyls, carboxyls, alcohols, ethers) and saturates all carbon-carbon multiple bonds. It does not, however, break open stable aliphatic rings like cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the reducing action of Red P + HI to the starting molecule:\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) at C1 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) at C2 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `C=C` double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a `C-C` single bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton (10 carbons) remains the same. The product is a saturated molecule containing one ring. Its molecular formula will be C10H20, which is the general formula for a monocyclic alkane (CnH2n).\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the final product in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: By analyzing the structural changes.**\n    The starting IHD was 5. The reaction removed four sources of unsaturation:\n    1.  The C=C bond in the ring.\n    2.  The C=C bond in the vinyl group.\n    3.  The C=O bond in the formyl group.\n    4.  The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n    The ring itself was not opened. So, the new IHD is the original IHD minus the unsaturation that was removed.\n    IHD_product = IHD_start - 4 = 5 - 4 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: By analyzing the final product's structure.**\n    The product is an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of π (pi) bonds = 0 (it is fully saturated)\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
