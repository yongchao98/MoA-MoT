    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The clue \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" strongly suggests a common reagent family. The mention of a \"heavier isotope\" points towards isotopically labeled compounds, which are often used in reaction mechanism studies. A prime candidate is a reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The \"very close analog\" incorporating a \"heavier isotope\" would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier stable isotope, deuterium (D or ²H). Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Verify the Reaction with Liquid Y:**\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is known to react violently with protic liquids. The prompt mentions a reaction with \"liquid Y\". A common choice for Y would be water (H₂O) or heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction releases gas W, \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n        *   Let's test potential products. The gas Deuterium (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ must react with a deuterium source. The most logical candidate for liquid Y is therefore **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This confirms that X is LiAlD₄, Y is D₂O, and the gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Precipitate G and Substance B:**\n    *   In the reaction above, lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, while aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   The problem states that heating G releases B. When metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) are heated, they decompose, typically releasing water (or heavy water).\n    *   The decomposition is: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   The substance released is heavy water, **D₂O**. So, **B = D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Melting Point of B:**\n    *   The prompt states the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   The melting point of D₂O (heavy water) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This value is indeed very close to 277 K, further confirming our identification of B as D₂O.\n\n5.  **Verify the Keto Acid Reaction:**\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols (-OH group).\n    *   The reaction `R-CO-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄` results in a diol, `R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂(OH)`. The final product has only **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue provided.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   We have confidently identified Substance X as **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen, present as its isotope Deuterium (D).\n    *   The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of these two elements in one formula unit of LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation (Mass(D) = 2 amu; Mass(Al) = 27 amu).\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 × Mass(D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 × Mass(Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = (Mass from D) + (Mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B. The complex wording \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" is interpreted to mean that one must sum the masses of all atoms of the relevant elements found in the molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>"
