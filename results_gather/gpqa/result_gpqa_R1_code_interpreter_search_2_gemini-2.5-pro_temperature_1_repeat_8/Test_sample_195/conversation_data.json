    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system, the total energy remains constant. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential, the conserved quantity is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the relevant energies.**\n    *   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T):** The kinetic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $T = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy stored in the spring at a displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the conservation of energy equation.**\n    The total mechanical energy $E_{mech} = T + U$ is conserved.\n    $E_{mech} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at two key points.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The kinetic energy is $T_1 = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum, $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total mechanical energy is $E_{mech} = T_1 + U_1 = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The kinetic energy is at its maximum, $T_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        The total mechanical energy is $E_{mech} = T_2 + U_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy at Point 1 must equal the total energy at Point 2.\n    $E_{mech}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{mech}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    First, rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Rearrange to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
