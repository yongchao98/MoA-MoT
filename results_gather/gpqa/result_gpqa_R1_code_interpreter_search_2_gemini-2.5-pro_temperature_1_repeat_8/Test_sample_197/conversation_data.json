    "This problem requires us to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This mole fraction, when multiplied by 100, gives the desired percentage.\n\n1.  **Identify the species:**\n    The cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free aquated ion `Co^2+` and the various thiocyanato complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`.\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Formulate the mole fraction expression:**\n    The mole fraction of a specific complex, say `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, is denoted by `αn`. We are interested in `α2` for `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)`\n\n    We can factor out and cancel `[Co^2+]` from the numerator and denominator:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Assumption on [SCN-] concentration:**\n    The total thiocyanate concentration is `0.1 M`, and the total cobalt concentration is `0.01 M`. Since the ligand concentration is ten times higher than the metal ion concentration, we can assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate, `[SCN-]`, is approximately equal to its initial total concentration, `0.1 M`.\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    Now, we plug the given values into the equation for `α2`:\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    We will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the mole fraction equation\n# Denominator = 1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the Co(SCN)2 complex\n# Numerator = β2*[SCN-]^2\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the mole fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n```output\n16.916180326482276\n```\nThe calculation shows that the mole fraction `α2` is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem is to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution containing cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate ions.\n\n**1. Define the System**\nThe system involves the following equilibrium reactions between the cobalt(II) ion (`Co^2+`) and the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN^-`):\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]) = 9`\n*   `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n*   `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n*   `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Mole Fraction (α)**\nThe mole fraction of a specific species, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, denoted as `αn`, is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`.\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nWe want to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]`, which corresponds to `α2 * 100%`.\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n**3. Expressing Mole Fraction in terms of β and [SCN-]**\nBy substituting the expressions from the stability constants into the `c(Co)` equation, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for `α2`:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**4. Assumption and Calculation**\nThe total concentration of cobalt is `c(Co) = 0.01 M`, and the total concentration of thiocyanate is `[SCN^-]_total = 0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is 10 times greater than the metal ion concentration, the ligand is in large excess. We can therefore approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN^-]` as being equal to its total initial concentration.\n`[SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β1[SCN^-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β2[SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β3[SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β4[SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe denominator sum is `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`.\nThe numerator is `β2[SCN^-]^2 = 0.4`.\n\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
