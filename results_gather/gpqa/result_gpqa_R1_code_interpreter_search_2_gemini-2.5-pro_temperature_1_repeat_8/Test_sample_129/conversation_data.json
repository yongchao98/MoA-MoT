    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the key physical quantities:**\n    *   The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of hydrogen:  λ_rest ≈ 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   The observational constraint: The object must be detected with \"optical ground-based telescopes\".\n\n2.  **Understand the constraint:** The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation, primarily due to absorption by ozone (O3). This atmospheric absorption sets a limit on the shortest wavelength of light that can reach a telescope on the ground. This \"atmospheric cutoff\" is typically around 3500-3800 Å (or 350-380 nm). For an absorption line to be detectable, its observed wavelength must be longer than this cutoff.\n\n3.  **Define redshift:** Redshift (z) describes the stretching of the wavelength of light due to the expansion of the universe. The relationship between the rest wavelength (λ_rest) and the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is given by the formula:\n    λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n4.  **Set up the problem:** We need to find the *lower limit* on the redshift (the minimum `z`). This means we need to find the redshift that shifts the Lyα line from its rest wavelength of 1216 Å to the minimum observable wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff. Let's use a standard value for the atmospheric cutoff, approximately 3500 Å.\n\n5.  **Calculate the redshift:** We can rearrange the redshift formula to solve for `z`:\n    1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n    z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\n    Now, substitute the values:\n    *   λ_observed = 3500 Å (our assumed atmospheric cutoff)\n    *   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n\n```python\n# Rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# Approximate minimum observable wavelength from the ground due to atmospheric cutoff, in Angstroms.\n# A typical value is around 3500 Angstroms.\nlambda_observed_min = 3500\n\n# Calculate the minimum redshift 'z' using the formula: z = (lambda_observed / lambda_rest) - 1\nz_min = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\nprint(f\"The calculated lower limit on the redshift is: {z_min}\")\n```\nThe calculation shows that a redshift of approximately 1.878 is required to shift the 1216 Å line to 3500 Å.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 1.9\n    *   B) 1.2\n    *   C) 3\n    *   D) 2.4\n\n    The calculated value `z ≈ 1.878` is extremely close to 1.9. Therefore, a quasar or the absorbing cloud must have a redshift of at least 1.9 for its Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be shifted into the observable optical window for a ground-based telescope.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls in the far-ultraviolet (UV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nGround-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation. The atmospheric cutoff, the minimum wavelength that can reliably reach the ground, is around 3500 Å.\n\nFor the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable by a ground-based telescope, it must be redshifted from its rest wavelength of 1216 Å to an observed wavelength (λ_observed) of at least 3500 Å.\n\nThe relationship between redshift (z), rest wavelength, and observed wavelength is given by the formula:\n\nλ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the lower limit on the redshift, we set λ_observed to the minimum detectable wavelength (3500 Å) and solve for z:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.878 - 1\nz ≈ 1.878\n\nThis calculated minimum redshift of ~1.88 is closest to the given option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
