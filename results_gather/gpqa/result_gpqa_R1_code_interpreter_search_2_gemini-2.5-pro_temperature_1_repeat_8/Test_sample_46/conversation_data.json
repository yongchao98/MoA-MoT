    "**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl C=O group) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (typically 1650-1690 cm-1) but is perfect for an ester, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the typical ~1740 cm-1).\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) means it's adjacent to a -CH2- group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This is a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) means it's adjacent to a -CH3 group (n+1 rule, 3+1=4). This is a methylene group (-CH2-). The high chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates it's attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, we can identify an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH2-CH3)**. This is consistent with the ester functional group suggested by the IR.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH). Since the IR spectrum indicated a primary amine (-NH2), this signal perfectly corresponds to the two protons of the **amine group**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. We have two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons appearing at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm, more deshielded) are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n    *   The protons appearing at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm, more shielded) are adjacent to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n*   We have the following pieces:\n    1.  A primary amine group (-NH2), which is an EDG.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), where the carbonyl makes the whole group an EWG.\n    3.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   Let's assemble them. We place the -NH2 group and the -COOCH2CH3 group at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring.\n*   The resulting structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Let's check this structure against the data:\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. Correct.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group would be shielded (at ~7.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group would be deshielded (at ~8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data.\n    *   **All other data points** (IR, ethyl group, amine protons) are also consistent with this structure.\n\n**5. Evaluating Other Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band, and the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1). Incorrect.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the acyl group is a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-). The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is meta-substituted. The IR for the amide C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1), and the NMR aromatic region would show a more complex splitting pattern, not two doublets. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
