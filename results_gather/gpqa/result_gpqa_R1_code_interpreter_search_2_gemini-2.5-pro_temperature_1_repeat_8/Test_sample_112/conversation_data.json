    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of the very broad O-H peak and the C=O peak strongly suggests the molecule is a **carboxylic acid**. The C=C peak indicates the molecule is also **unsaturated** (contains an alkene).\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to determine the chemical composition of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n        *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl functional group (-COOH):\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of Carbon) + (2 × Mass of Oxygen) + (1 × Mass of Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass ≈ (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) = 45.02\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** The fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to the **[COOH]⁺ ion**. This is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids and provides strong evidence for this functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Data and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the analysis, we know the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **A) C₆H₁₀O₂** and **B) C₆H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our spectroscopic data revealed two sources of unsaturation: one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means the molecule must have a **DoU of 2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our experimental evidence.\n        *   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not match. A compound with this formula and a carboxylic acid group would be saturated (e.g., hexanoic acid) and would not show peaks for a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence from all three techniques points to a single conclusion. The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This requires the presence of two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ fits all the data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
