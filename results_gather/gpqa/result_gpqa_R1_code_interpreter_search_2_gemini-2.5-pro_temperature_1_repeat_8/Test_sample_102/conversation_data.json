    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    All three substituents are in a meta relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Directing Effects:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Proposed Sequences:** The goal is to find a sequence that positions these three groups in the 1,3,5 arrangement in high yield. Friedel-Crafts reactions (like the acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro (-NO2) group.\n\n    *   **Option D:** i) Nitration -> ii) Reduction -> iii) Diazotization -> iv) Deamination. This sequence (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline -> benzenediazonium -> benzene) is circular and pointless. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** i) Bromination -> ii) Nitration -> iii) Acylation.\n        *   i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.\n        *   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\n        *   iii) Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option B:** i) Nitration -> ii) Reduction to aniline -> iii) Acylation...\n        *   This path involves Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) after forming aniline (step ii). Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing -NH2-AlCl3 complex.\n        *   Let's assume this leads to 3-aminoacetophenone. The subsequent steps (bromination and nitration) would have to correctly place the -Br and -NO2 groups.\n        *   For example, bromination of 3-aminoacetophenone would be directed by the powerful *ortho, para*-directing amino group, leading to substitution at positions 2, 4, or 6, not the required position 5. If we assume the Lewis acid makes the amino group *meta*-directing, then both -COCH3 and the modified amino group would direct to position 5. However, the subsequent nitration step would have three deactivating groups on the ring, making the reaction very difficult and unlikely to proceed to the correct isomer in high yield. This entire pathway is convoluted and unlikely to be efficient.\n\n    *   **Option A:** i) Acylation -> ii) Bromination -> iii) Nitration...\n        *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n        *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position. This step is correct.\n        *   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** Now the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 at C1 (*meta*-directing) and -Br at C3 (*ortho, para*-directing).\n            *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n            *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n            *   Although the directing effects are in conflict, position 5 is sterically the most accessible. Positions 2 and 6 are ortho to two groups, and position 4 is ortho to the acetyl group. Therefore, nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, yielding **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired product.\n        *   The sequence of steps i, ii, and iii provides a direct and high-yield route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in option A (iv-vii) would modify the product and are nonsensical in this context. However, among the given choices, the initial part of sequence A is the only chemically sound and efficient synthesis for the target molecule. It is common in such questions that the correct option contains the core valid synthesis path, even if extraneous steps are added.\n\n**Conclusion:** The sequence starting with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the most logical and efficient path to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This corresponds to the first three steps of option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
