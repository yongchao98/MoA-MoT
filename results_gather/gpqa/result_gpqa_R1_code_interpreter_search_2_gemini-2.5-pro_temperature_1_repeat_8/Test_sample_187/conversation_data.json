    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to find the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice parameter `a`: The problem states \"interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom\". In the context of a crystal lattice, this is typically interpreted as the lattice parameter `a`. So, `a = 10` Angstrom.\n    *   Interfacial angles: `α = β = γ = 30°`. Since all angles are equal and not 90°, this confirms the rhombohedral (or trigonal) system.\n    *   Miller indices of the plane: `(hkl) = (111)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Correct Formula:** I need the formula for the interplanar spacing (`d_hkl`) for a rhombohedral crystal system.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to determine the interplanar distance.\n\n### **1. Identify Given Information**\n\n*   **Crystal System:** Rhombohedral\n*   **Lattice Parameters:** Since it's rhombohedral, `a = b = c`. The problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which we take as the lattice constant `a`. So, `a = 10` Å.\n*   **Interaxial Angles:** `α = β = γ = 30°`\n*   **Miller Indices:** The plane is `(hkl) = (111)`\n\n### **2. Select the Correct Formula**\n\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` is:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\n### **3. Substitute the Values into the Formula**\n\n*   `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`\n*   `a = 10`\n*   `α = 30°`\n\n### **4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script to compute the result. The script will substitute the given values into the formula and calculate `d`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\na = 10.0  # in Angstroms\nalpha_degrees = 30.0\n\n# --- Convert angle to radians for Python's math functions ---\nalpha_radians = math.radians(alpha_degrees)\n\n# --- Calculate trigonometric terms ---\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_radians)\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_radians)\n\n# --- Calculate terms involving Miller indices ---\nhkl_sum_sq = h**2 + k**2 + l**2\nhkl_cross_terms = h*k + k*l + l*h\n\n# --- Calculate the numerator of the 1/d^2 formula ---\nnumerator = (hkl_sum_sq * sin_alpha**2) + (2 * hkl_cross_terms * (cos_alpha**2 - cos_alpha))\n\n# --- Calculate the denominator of the 1/d^2 formula ---\ndenominator_factor = 1 - 3*cos_alpha**2 + 2*cos_alpha**3\ndenominator = a**2 * denominator_factor\n\n# --- Calculate 1/d^2 ---\none_over_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n\n# --- Calculate d (the interplanar distance) ---\nd = 1 / math.sqrt(one_over_d_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{d:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe code execution will yield the value of the interplanar distance. Based on the calculation, the result is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
