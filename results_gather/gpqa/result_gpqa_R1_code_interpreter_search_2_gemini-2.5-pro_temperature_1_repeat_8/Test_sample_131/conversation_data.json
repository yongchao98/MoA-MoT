    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Mixture:** The two compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is important for comparing the integration of signals from the two different molecules.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" implies that the two compounds have different chemical shifts for their aromatic protons.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means the aromatic protons on each molecule are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means that the number of aromatic protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of aromatic protons giving rise to the second signal. Since it's a 1:1 mixture of compounds, this implies that each compound has the same number of aromatic protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Three signals\" is the total number of unique alkyl proton environments from both compounds combined.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these are methyl groups (or other alkyl groups) not adjacent to any protons. In this context, they are all methyl groups.\n    *   The \"2:1:1 ratio\" refers to the relative number of protons in each environment.\n\n**2. Analyze the NMR spectra of each possible compound:**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options. All have the formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They are not adjacent to each other. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to the two planes of symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 Ar-H singlet (2H), 1 Alkyl-H singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry (C2v) passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They are not adjacent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically different methyl groups:\n        *   Me at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   Me at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   Me at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 Ar-H singlet (2H), 3 Alkyl-H singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry (C2v) bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. Although adjacent, equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of chemically different methyl groups:\n        *   Me at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   Me at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 Ar-H singlet (2H), 2 Alkyl-H singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will be a **quartet** (4H), and the methyl (-CH3) protons will be a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 Ar-H singlet (4H), 1 Alkyl-H quartet (4H), 1 Alkyl-H triplet (6H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the mixture options based on the predicted spectra:**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and compare with the experimental data.\n\n**Experimental Data:**\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Alkyl: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: (1 singlet, 2H) + (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)**\n*   Alkyl: (2 singlets, 6H+6H) + (3 singlets, 6H+3H+3H) -> Total of 4 or 5 singlets. **(Does not match)**\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: (1 singlet, 2H) + (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)**\n*   Alkyl: (1 singlet, 12H) + (2 singlets, 6H+6H) -> Total of **3 singlets**. The integrations are 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1. (Matches)**\n\n**C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: (1 singlet, 2H) + (1 singlet, 4H) -> 2 singlets, 1:2 ratio. **(Does not match)**\n*   Alkyl: Will contain triplets and quartets, not just singlets. **(Does not match)**\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: (1 singlet, 2H) + (1 singlet, 2H) -> **2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. (Matches)**\n*   Alkyl: (1 singlet, 12H) + (3 singlets, 6H+3H+3H) -> Total of **4 singlets**. **(Does not match)**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly the combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option B) produces a combined spectrum that perfectly matches all the given data: two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>"
