def check_synchrocyclotron_revolutions():
    """
    Checks the calculation for the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron.

    The number of revolutions (N) is the total kinetic energy gained (T_final)
    divided by the energy gained per revolution (delta_T_rev).

    The energy gained per revolution is twice the energy gained per acceleration event,
    as the proton is accelerated twice per turn.

    The energy per acceleration event is e * U0 * cos(Phi0), where e is the elementary charge.
    When working in electron-volts (eV), the energy gain is numerically equal to the
    voltage difference in volts.
