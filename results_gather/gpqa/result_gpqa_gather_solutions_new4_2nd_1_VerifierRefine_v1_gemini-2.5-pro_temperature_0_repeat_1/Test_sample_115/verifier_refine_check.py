    # Step 1-3: Verify the reaction sequence leading to the Diels-Alder reactants.
    # - Compound A (NMR: 6H triplet, 4H quartet) is n-butane.
    # - Compound B (monobromination of A) is 2-bromobutane.
    # - Compound C (elimination from B) is but-2-ene. The problem specifies using the cis-isomer.
    # This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the correct reactants for the final step.

    # Step 4: Verify the Diels-Alder product (Compound D).
    
    # Part 1: Check the product's carbon skeleton (connectivity).
    # The reaction between penta-1,3-dien-1-ol and but-2-ene forms a six-membered ring
    # with substituents at positions 1, 4, 5, and 6.
