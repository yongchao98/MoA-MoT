def check_relativistic_energy():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the calculated relativistic energy for a Li-6 nucleus.

    The function calculates the energy using three different methods for the rest mass:
    1. Precise nuclear mass (accounts for binding energy).
    2. Sum of constituent nucleon masses (ignores binding energy).
    3. Mass number approximation (A * neutron mass, ignores binding energy).

    It then compares these results to the provided answer to determine if it's correct.
