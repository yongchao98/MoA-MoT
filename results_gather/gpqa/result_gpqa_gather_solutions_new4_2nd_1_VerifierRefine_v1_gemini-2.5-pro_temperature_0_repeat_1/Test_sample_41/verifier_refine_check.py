    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the exoplanet orbital period problem.

    The solution is based on two principles:
    1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) vs. Orbital Distance (a): T_eq ∝ 1/√a
    2. Kepler's Third Law: Period (P) vs. Orbital Distance (a): P ∝ a^(3/2)

    Combining these gives a direct relationship: P ∝ 1/T_eq³.
    Therefore, the period ratio P₃/P₁ = (T₁/T₃)³.
