Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of stereoisomers.

**Step 1: Deconstruct the IUPAC Name and Draw the Structure**
The name of the compound is **6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol**.
*   **Parent Chain**: `undeca` indicates an 11-carbon chain.
*   **Unsaturation**: `-3,7-dien` indicates two double bonds, one starting at carbon 3 (between C3 and C4) and another at carbon 7 (between C7 and C8).
*   **Principal Functional Group**: `-5-ol` indicates a hydroxyl (-OH) group on carbon 5.
*   **Substituents**: `6-chloro` (a Cl atom on C6), `9-ethyl` (a -CH₂CH₃ group on C9), and `2-methyl` (a -CH₃ group on C2).

The resulting chemical structure is:
`CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`
` 1    2      3   4    5      6      7   8    9          10   11`

**Step 2: Identify All Stereocenters**
Stereoisomers arise from stereocenters. We need to identify both chiral centers (asymmetric carbons) and stereogenic double bonds (capable of E/Z isomerism).

**Careful Point 1: Identifying Chiral Centers**
A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups.
*   **C2**: This carbon is bonded to two identical methyl groups (one is C1, the other is a substituent). Therefore, it is **not a chiral center**.
*   **C5**: This carbon is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the group to the left (`-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂`), and 4) the group to the right (`-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-...`). Therefore, **C5 is a chiral center**.
*   **C6**: This carbon is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -Cl, 3) the group to the left (`-CH(OH)-CH=CH-...`), and 4) the group to the right (`-CH=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-...`). Therefore, **C6 is a chiral center**.
*   **C9**: This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen, an ethyl substituent, and the rest of the main chain. The C10-C11 part of the main chain is also an ethyl group. Since C9 is bonded to two identical ethyl groups, it is **not a chiral center**.

There are a total of **2 chiral centers**.

**Careful Point 2: Identifying Stereogenic Double Bonds**
A double bond can exhibit E/Z (geometric) isomerism if *each* carbon of the double bond is attached to two *different* groups.
*   **C3=C4 double bond**: C3 is bonded to -H and an isopropyl group. C4 is bonded to -H and the rest of the chain. Since the groups on each carbon are different, this double bond **is a stereocenter**.
*   **C7=C8 double bond**: C7 is bonded to -H and the rest of the chain. C8 is bonded to -H and the rest of the chain. Since the groups on each carbon are different, this double bond **is also a stereocenter**.

There are a total of **2 stereogenic double bonds**.

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Stereoisomers**
The total number of stereocenters (n) is the sum of the chiral centers and the stereogenic double bonds.
*   n = (Number of chiral centers) + (Number of stereogenic double bonds)
*   n = 2 + 2 = 4

**Careful Point 3: Applying the 2ⁿ Rule**
The maximum number of stereoisomers is given by the formula 2ⁿ. This formula is applicable when the molecule is unsymmetrical, as it is in this case (the two ends of the molecule are different). Therefore, no meso compounds are possible.
*   Total number of stereoisomers = 2ⁿ = 2⁴ = 16.

**Conclusion**
The analysis of the structure reveals 2 chiral centers and 2 stereogenic double bonds, for a total of 4 stereocenters. Since the molecule is unsymmetrical, the total number of possible stereoisomers is 2⁴ = 16. This corresponds to option D. The vast majority of the candidate answers perform this exact analysis correctly, even if some of them select the wrong final letter. The chemical reasoning is overwhelmingly consistent.
