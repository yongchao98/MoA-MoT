    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Question: Identify the compound with specific FTIR and 1H NMR signals.
    # FTIR: Confirms a carboxylic acid functional group, which is true for all options.
    # 1H NMR: The key constraint is that the molecule must have BOTH a proton that gives a
    # 'doublet of triplets of quartets' (dtq) signal AND another proton that gives a
    # 'doublet of triplets of triplets' (dtt) signal.
    #
    # Splitting Pattern Analysis (n+1 rule for C-H to C-H coupling):
    # - dtq -> A CH proton must be coupled to a CH (1H), a CH2 (2H), and a CH3 (3H).
    #          The neighboring carbons must have 1, 2, and 3 protons.
    # - dtt -> A CH proton must be coupled to a CH (1H) and two different CH2 groups (2H each).
    #          The neighboring carbons must have 1, 2, and 2 protons.
