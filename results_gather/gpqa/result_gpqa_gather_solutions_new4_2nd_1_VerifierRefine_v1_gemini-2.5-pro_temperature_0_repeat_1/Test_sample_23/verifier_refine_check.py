**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.

**Question**:
If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.
Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.

A) 16
B) 12
C) 22
D) 18

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Identify Substance Z**:
    *   **Information**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated and a common solvent.
    *   **Analysis**: The mass fraction 14.28% is equivalent to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `y = 2x`. The general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane.
    *   **Conclusion**: The fact that it's a common solvent and the ultimate product of all reactions involving C₆ rings (as will be shown) strongly indicates Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.

2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**:
    *   **Information**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.
    *   **Analysis**: The other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Since it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene. The only logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under these conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.
    *   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.

3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms**:
    *   **Information**: Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction.
    *   **Reaction**: `Mixture X (Liquid A + Liquid B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`
    *   **Analysis**: Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture and produces an equimolar mixture, we can consider the reaction of one molecule of A with one molecule of B. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.
    *   **Calculation**: We can sum the atoms in the products:
        *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 12
        *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18
    *   **Conclusion**: The two molecules in mixture X must have a combined formula of C₁₂H₁₈. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is therefore **18**.

### Careful Points to Consider

*   **Mass Fraction**: The 14.28% hydrogen mass fraction is a key clue pointing directly to the CₙH₂ₙ formula, and combined with saturation, it confirms a cycloalkane structure.
*   **Disproportionation**: This specific reaction type, especially on a platinum catalyst, classically converts unsaturated cyclic compounds into a mixture of the corresponding saturated (cycloalkane) and aromatic compounds. This strongly supports the identification of Mixture Y as cyclohexane and benzene.
*   **Conservation of Atoms**: This is the most direct and reliable method to solve the problem. Instead of needing to identify the exact components of Mixture X, we can deduce their total atomic composition from the known products.
*   **Non-conjugated Bonds**: This detail is crucial for a consistency check. It allows us to identify the components of Mixture X as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), ruling out the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The sum of hydrogens (10 + 8 = 18) confirms the result from the conservation law.
*   **Equimolar Mixtures**: This condition simplifies the stoichiometry of the reaction to a 1:1 ratio for all components, allowing for a direct atom count comparison between one set of reactants and one set of products.

### Final Answer Derivation

The problem can be solved most efficiently by focusing on the products of the reaction.
1.  Mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).
2.  The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture Y is 12 + 6 = 18.
3.  Due to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of the starting mixture X must also be 18.
4.  This corresponds to option D.
