def check_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer based on physical principles.

    The analysis relies on the formulas for mean free path (MFP) and the
    relationship between the collision cross-sections.

    1. MFP for gas-gas collisions (λ1):
       λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)
       The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of all gas molecules.

    2. MFP for electron-gas collisions (λ2):
       λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
       The √2 factor is absent because the high-speed electrons interact with
       effectively stationary gas molecules.

    3. The ratio λ2 / λ1 is therefore:
       λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg

    4. The critical physical insight is the relationship between the cross-sections:
       For a high-energy (1000 keV) penetrating electron, the scattering
       cross-section (σ_eg) is significantly SMALLER than the kinetic
       cross-section for two molecules colliding (σ_gg).
       Therefore, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number greater than 1.

    # --- Step 1: Define the known physical relationships ---

    # The ratio of the mean free paths is sqrt(2) times the ratio of the cross-sections.
