def check_synthesis_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the proposed answer for the synthesis of
    1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.

    The correct pathway involves:
    1. Alkylation of the terminal alkyne to form an internal alkyne.
    2. Partial reduction of the alkyne to an alkene (NOT a full reduction to an alkane).
    3. Reductive ozonolysis of the alkene to form an aldehyde (NOT oxidative ozonolysis to a carboxylic acid).
    4. Base-catalyzed aldol addition.
