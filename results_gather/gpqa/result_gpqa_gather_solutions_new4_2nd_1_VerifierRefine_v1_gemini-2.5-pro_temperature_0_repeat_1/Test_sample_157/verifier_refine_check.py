def check_molecular_phenotype_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer regarding the molecular
    phenotype of a dominant-negative mutation in a transcription factor.

    The core logic is based on the definition of a dominant-negative mutation in a
    protein that must dimerize to function.

    1.  **Dominant-Negative Effect**: The mutant protein interferes with the wild-type (WT)
        protein's function. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype.
    2.  **Mechanism**: For interference to occur, the mutant subunit must still be able to
        dimerize with the WT subunit, forming a non-functional heterodimer. A complete
        loss of dimerization would lead to a recessive mutation, not a dominant-negative one.
    3.  **Genetic Consequence**: The interference renders the protein produced by the WT
        allele non-functional. This is precisely described as a "loss-of-function of the
        wild-type allele".
    4.  **Cellular Response**: Non-functional or misfolded protein complexes are often
        recognized by the cell's quality control systems (like the ubiquitin-proteasome
        pathway) and targeted for degradation.

    The function evaluates the provided final answer against these established biological principles.
