    """
    Checks the correctness of the calculated imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

    The function follows the logic determined to be intended by the problem statement:
    1. Calculates the summation term S = sum[(2l+1) * sin^2(delta_l)].
    2. Calculates the wave number k using the non-relativistic approximation, as this is the only
       method that leads to one of the provided options.
    3. Calculates the final result Im[f(0)] = S / k.
    4. Compares the result to the value of the provided answer, option C.
