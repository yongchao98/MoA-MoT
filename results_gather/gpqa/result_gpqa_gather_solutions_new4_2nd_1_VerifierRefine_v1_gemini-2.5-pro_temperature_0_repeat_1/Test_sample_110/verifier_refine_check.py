Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

### **Analysis of Reaction A**

1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction involves a ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one), an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael Addition** reaction.

2.  **Determine the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):** The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=O group) to form a nucleophilic enolate.
    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.
    *   **C2** is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated.
    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.
    *   **Conclusion:** Deprotonation can only occur at C6. The base removes this single available proton to form the enolate. The regioselectivity is determined by the structure of the ketone, not by the base's steric hindrance, as there is only one possible site.

3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond.

4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product A):**
    *   A `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is added to the C6 position of the original ketone.
    *   The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate, which is correct as the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone.
    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the ethyl propanoate chain.
    *   To name this complex substituent, we number the ring starting from the point of attachment. The original C6 of the ketone becomes the new C1 of the substituent.
        *   At the new **C1** (original C6): There is a **methyl** group.
        *   At the new **C2** (original C1): There is the carbonyl group, named as **oxo**.
        *   At the new **C3** (original C2): There is an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.
    *   Assembling the name of the substituent gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.
    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

### **Analysis of Reaction B**

1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane (1-nitropropane), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile), and a base (KOH). This is also a **Michael Addition**.

2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Carbanion):** The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate), `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.

3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).

4.  **Product Structure and Naming (Product B):**
    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.
    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.
    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has six carbons. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.
    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.
    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.
    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

### **Conclusion**

*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)
*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)
*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)
*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)

The only option that correctly identifies both major products is C. The chemical analysis performed by the majority of the agents is correct, even if their final letter choice is inconsistent due to variations in the options they were presented with. The chemical facts point unambiguously to option C.
