    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.

    **Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**
    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`
    *   **Identify the reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction known as **cyanohydrin formation**. A ketone (butan-2-one) is converted into a cyanohydrin.
    *   **Analyze the mechanism:**
        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group in butan-2-one.
        2.  This attack forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.
        3.  This negatively charged intermediate must be protonated to form the final, stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.
    *   **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction.
        *   Looking at the options for A, we have `NaHSO₃` and `H₃O⁺`.
        *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid and is an excellent source of protons for this protonation step.
        *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is a reagent for a different type of carbonyl addition reaction and is not suitable for completing the cyanohydrin synthesis.
    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options A and B.

    **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**
    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`
    *   **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a **nitrile hydrolysis**.
    *   **Analyze the mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires water and is typically catalyzed by a strong acid or a strong base, usually with heating.
    *   **Determine Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis. We must choose between the remaining options for B, which are `HCl` and `CH₃COOH`.
        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and highly effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this hydrolysis to completion under typical laboratory conditions.
    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B must be HCl**.

    **Step 3: Combine the findings and select the final answer.**
    *   From Step 1, we determined that **A = H₃O⁺**.
    *   From Step 2, we determined that **B = HCl**.

    The correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. Looking at the provided options:
    A) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
    B) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH
    C) A = H3O+, B = HCl
    D) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

    The correct option is C.
