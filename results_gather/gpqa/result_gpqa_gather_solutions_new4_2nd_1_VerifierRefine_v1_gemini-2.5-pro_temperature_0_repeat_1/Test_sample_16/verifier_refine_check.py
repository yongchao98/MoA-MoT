    # 1. Determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for the reaction:
    # [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻
    # Kd is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf)
    try:
        K_dissociation = 1 / K_formation
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error in calculation: The formation constant cannot be zero."

    # 2. Set up the equilibrium expression.
    # Let x = [Ca²⁺] at equilibrium. Then [EDTA⁴⁻] = x and [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x.
    # The expression is: Kd = x² / (0.02 - x)
    # This can be rearranged into a quadratic equation: x² + Kd*x - Kd*0.02 = 0

    # 3. Solve the quadratic equation for x.
    # Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
    # where a=1, b=Kd, c=-(Kd * initial_concentration)
    a = 1
    b = K_dissociation
