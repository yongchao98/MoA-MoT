    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the quantum mechanics question.

    The function will:
    1. Define all operators (Ay, A^2, Az) symbolically using sympy.
    2. Calculate the eigenvalues of Ay to check statements about them.
    3. Calculate the eigenvectors of Ay to check the statement about basis functions.
    4. Calculate the commutators [Ay, A^2] and [Ay, Az] to check the statement about simultaneous eigenfunctions.
    5. Evaluate the correctness of each statement from the original question.
    6. Compare the findings with the provided answer ('B').
