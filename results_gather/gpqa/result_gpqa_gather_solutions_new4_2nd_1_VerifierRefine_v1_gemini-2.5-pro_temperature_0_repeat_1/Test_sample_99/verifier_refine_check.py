    # Statement B: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

    # positive result as a violet, blue, or green color. The FeCl3 reagent itself is yellow.
    # A yellow color indicates a NEGATIVE test (no reaction). Due to steric hindrance from the
    # two ortho-methyl groups, Compound H gives a negative test. The statement is misleading
    # because it implies a positive reaction that produces a yellow color.
