    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for arranging substances
    by increasing para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.

    The check is based on established principles of organic chemistry:
    1.  Grouping: Meta-directors yield less para-isomer than ortho,para-directors.
    2.  Ordering Meta-Directors: Para-yield is inversely proportional to the deactivating
        strength of the group. Order of deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.
        Thus, para-yield order is: -NO2 (4) < -COOH (6) < -COOC2H5 (2).
    3.  Ordering Ortho,Para-Directors: Para-yield is determined by steric and electronic
        effects.
        - Sterics: The bulkier -C2H5 group favors para more than -CH3. So, 1 < 5.
        - Electronics/Sterics: The -Cl group strongly favors para substitution due to
          inductive effects and size, yielding more than alkylbenzenes. So, 5 < 3.
        Thus, para-yield order is: -CH3 (1) < -C2H5 (5) < -Cl (3).
    4.  Final Order: Combining the groups gives 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.

Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.

**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**
The first and most important step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This will separate the compounds into two distinct groups based on their para-isomer yield.

*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.
    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.
    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.
    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.

*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer will be a major product.
    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene): Activating.
    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene): Activating.
    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but directs ortho, para.

This classification establishes that the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yields), followed by the ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3).

**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield)**
For the meta-directing groups, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.

*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.
*   Therefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:
    *   Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).
*   This gives the first part of the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.

**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield)**
For this group, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.

*   **Comparing `-CH₃` (1) and `-C₂H₅` (5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the less-crowded *para* position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.

*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it deactivates the ring through its strong inductive effect, it directs ortho and para via resonance. The deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions than at the para position. This electronic effect, combined with the chlorine atom's size, strongly favors substitution at the para position. Experimental data shows that halogenation of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87-89%), which is higher than that for both toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene. Therefore, the order is **5 < 3**.

*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.

**Step 4: Combine the Orders and Determine the Final Answer**
By combining the two sorted groups, we obtain the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)
**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**

The complete sequence is:
**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**

This sequence corresponds to option B.
