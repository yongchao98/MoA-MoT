    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.

    Step 1: Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration)
    The first and most straightforward step is to sum the integration values for each signal to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.
    *   Signal at 7.0 ppm: 1H
    *   Signal at 5.5 ppm: 1H
    *   Signal at 2.1 ppm: 3H
    *   Signal at 1.6 ppm: 3H
    *   **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.**

    Careful Point 1: This total proton count can be used to quickly eliminate options.
    *   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** Has 8 protons. This matches the experimental data.
    *   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** Has 10 protons. This does not match the experimental data.
    Based on this, we can confidently eliminate the butenyl acetate options (A and D). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.

    Step 2: Analyze the Individual Signals (Chemical Shift and Splitting Pattern)
    This step helps confirm the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. We are looking to confirm the structure of propenyl acetate (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃).
    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) for 3 protons in this chemical shift region is characteristic of a methyl group on an acetate (CH₃COO-). The singlet multiplicity indicates it has no adjacent protons, which is correct for this group.
    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (CH₃) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n+1 rule, n=1). This is consistent with the terminal methyl group on the propenyl chain (CH₃-CH=), which is coupled to the adjacent vinylic proton.
    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A doublet of quartets (dq) for a single proton indicates it is coupled to two different sets of neighbors: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This perfectly describes the vinylic proton in the `CH=CH-CH₃` fragment, which is coupled to the other vinylic proton and the terminal methyl group.
    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d):** A doublet for a single proton. Its downfield chemical shift (~7.0 ppm) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom (-O-CH=). It is coupled only to the other vinylic proton, hence the doublet splitting.

    Careful Point 2: The splitting patterns (s, d, dq, d) and chemical shifts perfectly match the connectivity of a propenyl acetate molecule, confirming the conclusion from Step 1.

    Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)
    This is the final and most critical step to distinguish between the remaining two options.
    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm has a given coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the coupling between the two protons on the double bond.

    Careful Point 3: The magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between two protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their geometry.
    *   A **trans** configuration (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) shows a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.
    *   A **cis** configuration (protons on the same side of the double bond) shows a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.

    The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the expected range for a **trans** configuration. This allows us to eliminate the cis isomer (Cis-propenyl acetate).

    Final Conclusion:
    The analysis confirms the compound is a propenyl acetate (from proton count and splitting patterns) and that the double bond has a trans geometry (from the J-coupling constant). Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.

    This corresponds to option B.
