    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by recalculating the area.
    
    The area of a surface with metric ds^2 = g_ij dx^i dx^j is given by the integral of sqrt(det(g)) over the domain.
    
    1.  **Metric and Area Element**:
        ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) * (dx^2 + dy^2)
        The metric tensor is g = [[f(x,y), 0], [0, f(x,y)]] where f(x,y) = 32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2).
        det(g) = f(x,y)^2
        sqrt(det(g)) = f(x,y) = 32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)
        The area element is dA = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) dx dy.

    2.  **Domain**:
        The metric is defined for 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0, which is the open disk x^2 + y^2 < 4.

    3.  **Integral in Polar Coordinates**:
        We switch to polar coordinates: x = rho*cos(theta), y = rho*sin(theta).
        x^2 + y^2 = rho^2
        dx dy = rho d(rho) d(theta)
        The domain becomes 0 <= rho < 2 and 0 <= theta <= 2*pi.
        The integral for the area A is:
        A = integral from 0 to 2*pi [ integral from 0 to 2 [ (32 * rho) / (4 - rho^2) d(rho) ] ] d(theta)
