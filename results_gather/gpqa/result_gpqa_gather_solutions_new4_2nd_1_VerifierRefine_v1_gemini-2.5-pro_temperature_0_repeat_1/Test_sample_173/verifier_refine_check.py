    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer by recalculating the physics problem from scratch.
    
    The problem asks for the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy
    of the more massive fragment from a fission event.

    Mc2_initial = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV
    mass_sum_fraction = 0.99 # Sum of fragment masses is 99% of initial mass
    
    # The final answer from the LLM is <<<D>>>.
    # The options listed in the final LLM response are:
    # A) 10 MeV, B) 2 MeV, C) 20 MeV, D) 5 MeV
    # Therefore, the value corresponding to answer D is 5 MeV.
    llm_answer_value = 5.0 # in MeV

    # --- Step 1: Calculate fragment rest-mass energies ---
    # Let m1 be the more massive fragment and m2 be the less massive one.
    # m1 = 2 * m2  =>  m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2
    # m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M  =>  m1c^2 + m2c^2 = 0.99 * Mc^2
    
    sum_m_c2 = mass_sum_fraction * Mc2_initial
    # Substitute m1c^2 = 2 * m2c^2 into the sum:
    # 2 * m2c^2 + m2c^2 = sum_m_c2
    # 3 * m2c^2 = sum_m_c2
    m2c2 = sum_m_c2 / 3.0
    m1c2 = 2.0 * m2c2
    
    # --- Step 2: Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value) ---
    # Q is the mass defect converted to energy.
    Q = Mc2_initial - sum_m_c2
    
    # --- Step 3: Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation ---
    # From conservation of momentum (p1 = p2), the classical kinetic energies (T = p^2 / 2m)
    # are inversely proportional to the masses: T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = 1/2.
    # So, T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.
    # Since T1_cl + T2_cl = Q:
    # T1_cl + 2 * T1_cl = Q  =>  3 * T1_cl = Q
    T1_classical = Q / 3.0
    
    # --- Step 4: Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1 ---
    # From conservation of momentum (p1 = p2), we equate the relativistic momentum expressions:
    # (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2
    # Using (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2), we get:
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c2)
    # We also know T2 = Q - T1. Substitute this in:
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2c2
    # T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*m2c2 - 2*T1*m2c2
    # The T1^2 terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for T1:
    # 2*T1*m1c2 + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*m2c2 = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2
    # T1 * (2*m1c2 + 2*Q + 2*m2c2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2
    # T1 * (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2) + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)
    # T1 * (2 * sum_m_c2 + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)
    
    # Let's plug in the numbers from the LLM's simpler algebraic path to verify:
    # 600 * T1 = 603
    T1_relativistic = 603.0 / 600.0
    
    # --- Step 5: Find the difference and convert units ---
