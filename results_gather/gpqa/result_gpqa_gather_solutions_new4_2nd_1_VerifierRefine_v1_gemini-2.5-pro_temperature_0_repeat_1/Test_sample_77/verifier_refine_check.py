Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the finite speed of light, `c`, which means the potentials at an observation point $\vec{r}$ at time `t` are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, "retarded" time, $t_r$. The correct expressions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.

2.  **Define Variables and Retarded Time**:
    *   The charge's position at the retarded time is $\vec{s}(t_r)$.
    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r)$.
    *   The distance the signal travels is $d = |\vec{d}|$.
    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\vec{v}$.
    *   The retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$. This means the signal emitted at $t_r$ travels the distance $d$ to arrive at the observer at time $t$.

3.  **State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The derivation of these potentials from Maxwell's equations is a standard procedure in advanced electromagnetism. The resulting formulas are:
    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left[ \dfrac{q}{d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right]$
    *   Vector Potential: $\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left[ \dfrac{q\vec{v}}{d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} \right]$
    All quantities on the right-hand side ($\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.

4.  **Match the Standard Form to the Given Options**: The options in the question have a slightly different algebraic form in the denominator. We can convert our standard expressions to that form by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:
    *   For the scalar potential V:
        $V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \dfrac{q \cdot c}{c \left(d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}\right)} = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}$
    *   For the vector potential $\vec{A}$:
        $\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \dfrac{q\vec{v} \cdot c}{c \left(d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}\right)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}$

5.  **Carefully Compare with Each Option**: Now, we compare these final expressions with the choices provided in the prompt.

    *   **A) V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c + \vec{d}. \vec{v})},  \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d}. \vec{v})}**
        *   This is **incorrect**. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to the "advanced potentials," which are generally discarded as unphysical because they violate causality (effects preceding their cause).

    *   **B) V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r},  \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r},t)**
        *   This is **incorrect**. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation effect in the denominator.

    *   **C) V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r}, \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r},t)**
        *   This is **incorrect**. It also uses the static potential for V. While the relationship $\vec{A} = (\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.

    *   **D) V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})},  \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}**
        *   This is **correct**. This option perfectly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert (retarded) potentials.

### Conclusion

The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. A rigorous derivation shows that the denominator must contain the term $(dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})$, where the negative sign is characteristic of the retarded potential and respects causality. This matches option D.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while the vast majority correctly derive the physical formulas, many make a clerical error in matching their result to the lettered options. The correct physical derivation unambiguously supports option D.
