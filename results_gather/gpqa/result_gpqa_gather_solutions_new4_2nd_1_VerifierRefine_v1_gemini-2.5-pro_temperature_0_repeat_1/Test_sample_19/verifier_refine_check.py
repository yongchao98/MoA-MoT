Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.

**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept of the Impulse Approximation**
The question asks for the set of assumptions that jointly define the "impulse approximation." The central idea of this approximation is to simplify a complex interaction between a probe (e.g., an electron) and a nucleus (a many-body system). The simplification involves treating the interaction as if it occurs with a single nucleon that behaves like a free particle at the moment of the interaction. The name "impulse" implies a very sudden, high-energy event.

**Step 2: Analyze Each Assumption**

*   **Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
    This is the foundational "one-body" assumption. It is the first step in simplifying the many-body problem. It allows the total interaction to be treated as a sum of independent interactions with each nucleon. This explicitly neglects more complex phenomena where the probe might interact with the force-carrying particles between nucleons (meson-exchange currents) or with multiple nucleons simultaneously. This assumption is essential to isolate a single nucleon as the target.

*   **Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**
    This assumption addresses the environment of the interaction. For the struck nucleon to be treated as if it were free and isolated, the incoming probe must reach it without prior interactions, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) must leave the nucleus without subsequent interactions. These secondary collisions are known as Initial and Final State Interactions (ISI and FSI). Neglecting them is crucial for the simple picture of a clean, single-nucleon event to hold. This assumption is essential for the simplest form of the impulse approximation.

*   **Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, a topic governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The impulse approximation, however, operates at the scale of nucleons within a nucleus. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle for the interaction being studied. The internal physics of the nucleon (which is, in fact, highly relativistic) is a separate layer of theory and is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself. Therefore, this assumption is not a component of the impulse approximation.

*   **Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**
    This is the very essence of the "impulse" in the approximation's name. It assumes the interaction happens over a timescale so short that the binding forces holding the nucleon in the nucleus are negligible *during* the brief moment of the collision. The energy transferred is assumed to be much greater than the nucleon's binding energy. This is what allows the nucleon to be treated as a "free" particle at the interaction vertex. This assumption is essential.

**Step 3: Synthesize the Findings and Select the Correct Option**
The analysis shows that the impulse approximation is defined by a set of three core ideas:
1.  The interaction targets a single nucleon (Assumption 1).
2.  The environment is non-interfering, meaning the rest of the nucleus is transparent (Assumption 2).
3.  The target nucleon behaves as if it were free from binding forces during the rapid interaction (Assumption 4).

Therefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the given options:
A) 1,3,4 - Incorrect, as it includes the irrelevant assumption 3.
B) 1,2,3 - Incorrect, as it includes the irrelevant assumption 3 and omits the essential assumption 4.
C) 2,3,4 - Incorrect, as it includes the irrelevant assumption 3 and omits the essential assumption 1.
D) 1,2,4 - Correct, as it includes all three essential assumptions.
