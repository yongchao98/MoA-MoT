Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.

**Step 1: Understand the theoretical framework of SMEFT.**
The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM). It is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory (QFT). This means it is built upon the fundamental principles of special relativity and quantum mechanics. SMEFT adds higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian to parameterize the low-energy effects of new physics that might exist at a much higher energy scale. The key is to identify which symmetries are foundational to this construction and which are not.

**Step 2: Evaluate each symmetry individually.**

*   **1. Lorentz Symmetry & 2. Poincare Symmetry:**
    *   Lorentz symmetry (invariance under rotations and boosts) and the broader Poincare symmetry (which also includes spacetime translations) are the fundamental spacetime symmetries of special relativity.
    *   Any relativistic QFT, including the SM and its extensions like SMEFT, is built upon the principle of Poincare invariance. This is a non-negotiable requirement to ensure that the laws of physics are consistent for all inertial observers and that energy and momentum are conserved.
    *   Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be invariant under Poincare transformations. This means both **Lorentz symmetry (1)** and **Poincare symmetry (2)** must be respected.

*   **3. CP Symmetry (Charge-Parity):**
    *   CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P).
    *   It is a well-established experimental fact that the weak interaction within the Standard Model violates CP symmetry (as seen in the CKM matrix and kaon/B-meson decays).
    *   Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it does not impose symmetries that the SM itself already breaks. On the contrary, one of the primary motivations for SMEFT is to provide a systematic framework for parameterizing potential *new* sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model.
    *   Therefore, **CP symmetry (3) is not required** to be respected by all operators.

*   **4. CPT Symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal):**
    *   The **CPT Theorem** is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation.
    *   SMEFT is constructed precisely under these assumptions (it is a local, Lorentz-invariant theory). A violation of CPT would imply a violation of a more fundamental principle like Lorentz invariance, which is outside the standard SMEFT framework.
    *   Therefore, **CPT symmetry (4) must be respected**.

**Step 3: Synthesize the results and select the correct option.**

Based on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are:
*   1. Lorentz Symmetry
*   2. Poincare symmetry
*   4. CPT symmetry

The symmetry that is not required is CP symmetry (3).

The correct combination of required symmetries is {1, 2, 4}. Now, we match this set to the given options:

*   **A) 1,2,4** - This option correctly includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetry.
*   B) 1,3,4 - This is incorrect because it includes CP symmetry (3), which is not required.
*   C) 1,2 - This is incorrect because it omits the required CPT symmetry (4).
*   D) 3,4 - This is incorrect because it includes CP symmetry (3) and omits the required Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries.

The correct option is A.
