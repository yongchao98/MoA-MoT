    # 2. Analyze the reaction to determine the correct components
    # The reaction is a secondary amine + Reagent A -> Enamine.
    # This is a classic enamine synthesis, which requires a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone) as Reagent A.
    
    # Step A: Determine the correct Reagent A
    # 'vinylcyclohexane' is an alkene, not a carbonyl compound. It's an incorrect reactant.
    # 'cyclohexanecarbaldehyde' is an aldehyde (a carbonyl compound). It's the correct type of reactant.
    # Retrosynthesis of the product confirms that cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is the required starting material.

    # Step B: Determine the most suitable Catalyst B
    # The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration.
    # 'TsOH' (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong organic acid, a standard and highly effective catalyst for dehydration reactions.
    # 'Acetic acid' is a weak acid, which is less effective at promoting the rate-limiting dehydration step.
    # Given the use of heat to drive the reaction, a strong catalyst like TsOH is the most suitable choice.
