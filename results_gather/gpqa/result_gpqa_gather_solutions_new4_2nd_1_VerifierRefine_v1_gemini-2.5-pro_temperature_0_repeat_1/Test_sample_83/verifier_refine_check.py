Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.

**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement**
The question describes a specific numerical method for solving higher-dimensional heat equations and asks for the key factor that enables parallelization. Let's break down the components:
*   **Problem:** Solving a higher-dimensional heat equation.
*   **Discretization:** The spatial dimensions are discretized using "higher order finite difference approximations." This transforms the partial differential equation (PDE) into a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form `dU/dt = AU`.
*   **Time Integration:** The solution over a time step involves the matrix exponential function, `exp(AΔt)`.
*   **Approximation:** The matrix exponential is approximated by a "fractional approximation," which is a rational function `R(z) = P(z)/Q(z)`. The update step is `U_new ≈ R(AΔt)U_old`.
*   **Parallelization:** The goal is to convert the sequential algorithm into a parallel one using "parallel splitting."
*   **Question:** What is the *key factor* that enables this conversion?

**Step 2: Analyze the Sequential vs. Parallel Computation**
*   **Sequential Algorithm:** The approximation `U_new = R(AΔt)U_old` is equivalent to solving the large linear system `Q(AΔt)U_new = P(AΔt)U_old`. This is a single, large, implicit step where all the unknown values in `U_new` are coupled together by the matrix `Q(AΔt)`. This is a computational bottleneck and is inherently sequential.
*   **Parallel Algorithm:** A parallel algorithm must break this single large task into multiple smaller, independent tasks that can be executed simultaneously on different processors. The question is asking for the mathematical tool that performs this "splitting."

**Step 3: Evaluate Each Option as the "Key Factor"**

*   **A) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This is a characteristic of the physical problem being modeled. Nonlocal boundary conditions introduce long-range dependencies in the matrix `A`, which generally makes parallelization *more difficult*, not easier, as it requires more communication between processors. This is an obstacle, not an enabler.

*   **B) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The rational approximation `R(z)` has roots in its denominator polynomial `Q(z)`. These roots (poles of the function) can be real or complex. This detail affects the specific implementation of the sub-problems (e.g., requiring complex arithmetic if roots are complex), but it is not the fundamental principle that allows for parallelization. The parallel structure is created by the decomposition itself, which works for both real and complex roots. This is a detail within the key mechanism, not the mechanism itself.

*   **C) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation:** This is a mathematical technique that decomposes a complex rational function `R(z)` into a sum of simpler fractions. For example:
    `R(z) = c₀ + Σ [cᵢ / (z - dᵢ)]`
    When this is applied to the matrix problem, the calculation of `U_new` becomes:
    `U_new = (c₀I + Σ [cᵢ * (AΔt - dᵢI)⁻¹]) U_old`
    This can be computed by first solving for each intermediate vector `yᵢ` in the following set of linear systems:
    `(AΔt - dᵢI) yᵢ = U_old`
    Crucially, each of these linear systems is **independent** of the others. They can all be solved simultaneously on different processors. The final solution is then found by taking a linear combination: `U_new = c₀U_old + Σ cᵢyᵢ`. This decomposition is the exact mechanism that "splits" the single sequential problem into multiple parallel tasks. This is the direct enabler of the conversion.

*   **D) Stability analysis:** Stability analysis is a crucial process for verifying that a numerical method is reliable and that errors do not grow uncontrollably. A method, whether sequential or parallel, must be stable to be useful. However, stability is a required *property* of the algorithm, not the *mechanism* that creates its parallel structure. It ensures the parallel algorithm works correctly, but it doesn't create it. The question asks what *converts* the algorithm, not what makes it *valid*.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
The conversion from a sequential to a parallel algorithm is achieved by transforming a single, large, coupled problem into numerous smaller, independent sub-problems. The mathematical tool that accomplishes this transformation in this context is the partial fraction decomposition of the rational function used to approximate the matrix exponential. Therefore, the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation is the key enabling factor.
