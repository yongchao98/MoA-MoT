Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

**1. Deconstruct the Question**
The core of the question is to identify the molecular mechanism that makes the symptoms of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) less severe than those of Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21). This requires understanding the biological response to an extra sex chromosome versus an extra autosome.

**2. Identify the Key Biological Principle**
The fundamental difference in severity is due to a process called **dosage compensation**. In mammals, there is a natural mechanism to equalize the expression of genes on the X chromosome between males (XY) and females (XX). This mechanism is known as **X-chromosome inactivation (XCI)** or Lyonization. There is no equivalent large-scale inactivation mechanism for autosomes like chromosome 21.

**3. Apply the Principle to the Syndromes**
*   **Klinefelter's Syndrome (XXY):** The XCI mechanism is activated in individuals with an XXY karyotype. One of the two X chromosomes is epigenetically silenced and condensed into a compact, mostly inactive structure called a Barr body. This process occurs after fertilization (post-zygotically). By silencing the extra X chromosome, the cell largely normalizes the "dose" of X-linked genes, bringing it much closer to that of a typical XY male. This massive compensation is why the phenotype is less severe.
*   **Down's Syndrome (Trisomy 21):** In an individual with Down's syndrome, all three copies of chromosome 21 remain genetically active. This leads to a persistent 1.5-fold overexpression of hundreds of genes, causing a much more significant disruption to development and cellular function, which results in a more severe and wide-ranging phenotype.

**4. Analyze the Molecular Basis of X-Chromosome Inactivation**
X-inactivation is an epigenetic process, meaning it alters gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. The key molecular events that lead to the silencing of the X chromosome include:
*   Coating of the chromosome by a non-coding RNA (*Xist*).
*   Recruitment of protein complexes that modify the chromosome's structure.
*   Extensive **chromatin methylation**, specifically the methylation of histone proteins by enzymes called **histone methyltransferases**. This modification is a hallmark of silenced chromatin (heterochromatin) and is crucial for establishing and maintaining the inactive state.
*   This entire process occurs **post-zygotically**, in the early embryo.

**5. Evaluate the Given Options**
*   **A) chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote:** This option perfectly describes a core molecular event of X-chromosome inactivation. It correctly identifies the process (chromatin methylation), the enzymes involved (histone methyltransferases), and the timing (post-zygote). This is the direct mechanism that silences the extra X chromosome and mitigates the phenotype of Klinefelter's syndrome.
*   **B) attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I:** This is a process during meiosis. An error here can *cause* aneuploidy but does not explain the difference in the *severity* of the resulting syndromes after fertilization.
*   **C) progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst:** This refers to DNA replication, a general process necessary for all cell division, not a specific mechanism for gene silencing that would differentiate the outcomes of these two syndromes.
*   **D) chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis:** Like option B, this is a meiotic process whose failure can cause aneuploidy but does not explain the subsequent difference in phenotypic severity.

**Conclusion**
The less prominent phenotype of Klinefelter's syndrome is a direct result of X-chromosome inactivation, which compensates for the extra X chromosome. The molecular basis of this inactivation is epigenetic silencing. Option A provides the most accurate and specific description of a key molecular event in this process among the choices provided.
