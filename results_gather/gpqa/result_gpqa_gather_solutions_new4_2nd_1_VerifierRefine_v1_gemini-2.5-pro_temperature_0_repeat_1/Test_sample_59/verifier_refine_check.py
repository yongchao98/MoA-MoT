    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer to the special relativity problem.

    The problem involves calculating the proper time (time experienced by the astronaut)
    for a journey from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth.

    The solution requires:
    1. An external value for the distance to the LMC.
    2. Calculation of the Lorentz factor (gamma).
    3. Calculation of the time in Earth's frame (coordinate time).
    4. Calculation of the time in the astronaut's frame (proper time).
    5. Checking the survival condition.
    6. Comparing the result with the given multiple-choice options.
