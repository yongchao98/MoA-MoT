Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided answers and identifying key points.

### **Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Transformation**

The problem describes a two-step reaction sequence applied to two different starting materials:
1.  **Treatment with mCPBA:** This is an epoxidation reaction, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide.
2.  **Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Water acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs with inversion of stereochemistry, meaning it is an *anti*-addition relative to the epoxide oxygen.

The net result of this two-step sequence is the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene. Two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.

### **Step 2: Determine the Product of Reaction 1**

*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene.
*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.
*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.
*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.

### **Step 3: Determine the Products of Reaction 2**

*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene.
*   **Transformation:** Anti-dihydroxylation.
*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding rule is that the *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.
*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers is formed: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**

The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)
2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)
3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)

The relationships between these isomers are critical:
*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).
*   Compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).

### **Step 5: Predict the Chromatographic Observations**

*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**
    *   **Principle:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).
    *   **Separation:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.
    *   **Observation:** The meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3). The two enantiomers will elute together (co-elute) as a single peak.
    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.

*   **Chiral HPLC:**
    *   **Principle:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation. It also separates diastereomers.
    *   **Separation:** The chiral column can resolve all stereoisomers.
    *   **Observation:** The meso-diol (1), the (4R,5R)-diol (2), and the (4S,5S)-diol (3) will all be separated into distinct peaks.
    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.

### **Careful Points and Conclusion**

1.  **Reaction Stereochemistry:** The overall reaction must be correctly identified as *anti*-dihydroxylation.
2.  **Stereochemical Rules:** The rules for addition to *cis* and *trans* alkenes (Trans + Anti → Meso; Cis + Anti → Racemic) are essential and must be applied correctly.
3.  **Isomer Relationships:** The final mixture contains three stereoisomers: one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.
4.  **HPLC Principles:** The key distinction is that standard (achiral) columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers, while chiral columns separate both.
5.  **Matching Conclusion to Options:** The analysis consistently shows 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC. This result corresponds to option B. Many of the candidate answers performed the analysis correctly but failed to select the matching option.

The final answer is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
