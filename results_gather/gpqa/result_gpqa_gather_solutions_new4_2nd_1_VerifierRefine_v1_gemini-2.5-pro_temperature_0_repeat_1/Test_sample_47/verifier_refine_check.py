Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the provided answers and identifying the most accurate path to the solution.

### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**

The problem describes a four-step synthesis. The consensus among all candidate answers is unanimous and chemically sound regarding the identity of the products at each stage.

1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is replaced by a bromine atom.
    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**

2.  **Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base, known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction is characterized by a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring.
    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**

3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The -OH group is replaced by a -Cl atom.
    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**

4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** This reagent, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific purpose is to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.
    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**

### **Step 2: Analysis of the Final Product's Structure**

The final and most critical part of the question is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. This is equivalent to predicting the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.

**Careful Points for Analysis:**

*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.
*   **Chemical Equivalence:** Due to this symmetry, the carbon at position 2 (C2) is equivalent to C5, and C3 is equivalent to C4.
*   **Diastereotopicity:** The carbon at C1 is a stereocenter (or more accurately, a prochiral center). This means that the two protons on any given methylene group (CH₂) in the ring are not chemically equivalent; they are **diastereotopic**.

### **Step 3: Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Environments**

Based on the structure and symmetry, we can count the unique sets of hydrogen atoms:

1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique environment. (1 type)
2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)
3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** These two carbons are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, the "upper" proton on C2 is equivalent to the "upper" proton on C5, and the "lower" proton on C2 is equivalent to the "lower" proton on C5. This gives **two** distinct types of hydrogens from these four protons.
4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent, and the protons on them are also diastereotopic. This gives another **two** distinct types of hydrogens, which are different from the C2/C5 protons due to their distance from the aldehyde group.

**Total Count:**
Summing the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.

### **Conclusion**

The chemical analysis robustly concludes that there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This corresponds to option B in the provided choices. While many candidate answers made clerical errors in matching their correct reasoning to the final letter choice, the underlying chemical analysis is overwhelmingly consistent and correct.
