def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by simulating the
    benzyne reaction mechanism for 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

    The simulation follows these steps:
    1.  Define the starting molecule and reaction conditions.
    2.  Simulate the elimination step to identify all possible benzyne intermediates.
        This considers both H-abstraction and D-abstraction.
    3.  For each unique intermediate, simulate the nucleophilic addition step at all
        possible positions of the benzyne triple bond.
    4.  Canonicalize the resulting product structures to identify unique products.
        A product is canonicalized by placing the primary group (NH2) at position 1
        and representing other substituents by their type and relative position.
    5.  Count the number of unique products.
    6.  Compare this count to the number implied by the given answer choice.
