def check_chemistry_stereoisomers():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer for the given chemistry problem.
    It analyzes the self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene to determine the
    number of possible stereoisomeric products.

    The analysis considers three reaction pathways from the racemic mixture:
    1. (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene
    2. (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene
    3. (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene

    For each pathway, it considers the E/Z isomerism of the resulting double bond
    and the stereochemistry of the product (chiral, meso, etc.).

    # This produces two chiral diastereomers (E and Z isomers).
    rr_products = 2

    # Pathway 2: (S) + (S) -> (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene
    # This produces the two enantiomers of the (R,R) products. Since enantiomers

    # Interpretation A: Rigorous Stereochemical Analysis
    # - The (E)-(3R, 6S) isomer has a center of inversion and is an achiral meso compound. (1 product)
    # - The (Z)-(3R, 6S) isomer is chiral (it has a C2 axis but no improper axis of rotation).
    #   Since it's a chiral product from an achiral starting mix, it must be formed as a
    #   racemic mixture with its enantiomer, (Z)-(3S, 6R). (2 products)

    total_rigorous_count = rr_products + ss_products + rs_products_rigorous  # 2 + 2 + 3 = 7

    # Interpretation B: Common Textbook Simplification
    # This interpretation, often found in introductory/intermediate courses, incorrectly
    # assumes that both the E and Z isomers of the (R,S) product are meso compounds.
    # - (E)-(3R, 6S) is a meso compound. (1 product)
    # - (Z)-(3R, 6S) is also treated as a meso compound. (1 product)

    # The multiple-choice options are [2, 4, 8, 6].
    # The rigorously correct answer (7) is not an option.
