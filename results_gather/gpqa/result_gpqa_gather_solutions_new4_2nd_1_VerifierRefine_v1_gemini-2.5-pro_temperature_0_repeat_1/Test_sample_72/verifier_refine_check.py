    # --- Problem Parameters ---
    # Velocities are given as fractions of c
    v1_c = 0.6
    v2_c = 0.5
    # Masses are given as multiples of m
    m1_m = 2.0
    m2_m = 3.0

    # --- Theoretical Calculation ---

    # 1. Calculate Relative Speed (v_rel)
    # The relativistic velocity subtraction formula for collinear motion is:
    # v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)
    # Since our velocities are already fractions of c, the formula becomes:
    v_rel_calc = (v1_c - v2_c) / (1 - v1_c * v2_c)

    # 2. Calculate Total Energy (E_total)
    # The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies.
    # E_total = E1 + E2, where E = gamma * m * c^2
    # The Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)
    # We will calculate the total energy as a multiple of mc^2.

    # Astronaut 1
    gamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)
    E1_mc2 = gamma1 * m1_m

    # Astronaut 2
    gamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)
    E2_mc2 = gamma2 * m2_m

    # Total Energy
    E_total_calc = E1_mc2 + E2_mc2

    # --- Verification ---

    # The final answer provided by the LLM is <<<D>>>.
    # Let's check the values for option D:
    # D) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2
    answer_v_rel = 0.14
    answer_E = 5.96

    # Compare calculated values with the answer's values, using a tolerance
    # for floating-point comparisons. The options are given to 2 decimal places.
    tolerance = 0.005

    v_rel_match = abs(v_rel_calc - answer_v_rel) < tolerance
    E_total_match = abs(E_total_calc - answer_E) < tolerance

    if not v_rel_match:
        return f"Incorrect. The relative speed in the chosen answer is wrong. The calculated relative speed is approximately {v_rel_calc:.4f}c, but the answer states {answer_v_rel}c."
    
    if not E_total_match:
        return f"Incorrect. The total energy in the chosen answer is wrong. The calculated total energy is approximately {E_total_calc:.4f}mc^2, but the answer states {answer_E}mc^2."

    # Check if the LLM's reasoning matches the correct option.
