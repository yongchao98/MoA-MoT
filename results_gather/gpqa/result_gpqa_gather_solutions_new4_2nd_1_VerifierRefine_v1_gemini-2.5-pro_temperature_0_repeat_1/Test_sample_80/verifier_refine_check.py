def check_synthesis_pathway():

    Checks the correctness of a multi-step chemical synthesis pathway.

    The function analyzes a specific organic chemistry synthesis problem:
    Synthesizing [1,1'-bi(cyclopentylidene)]-2-one from 1,5-dichloropentane.

    It evaluates four possible reagent sequences (A, B, C, D) and determines
    which one is chemically sound. It then compares this correct pathway
    to the provided final answer.
