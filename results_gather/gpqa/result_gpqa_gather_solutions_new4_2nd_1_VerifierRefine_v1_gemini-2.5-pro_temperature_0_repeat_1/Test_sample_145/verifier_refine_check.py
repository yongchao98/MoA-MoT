def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the Diels-Alder reaction between
    5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride.

    The function codifies the established chemical principles for this reaction:
    1.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity**: The Alder-Endo rule predicts the 'endo' adduct is the major kinetic product.
        The 'endo' skeleton is identified by the '(4S,7R)' stereochemistry for the given enantiomer.
    2.  **Facial Selectivity**: For a 5-fluoro-cyclopentadiene, electronic effects favor 'syn'-facial attack over the sterically preferred 'anti'-attack.
    3.  **Product Structure**: A 'syn'-facial attack leads to an 'anti'-adduct, where the fluorine on the C8 bridge is on the opposite side of the bicyclic system from the anhydride ring.
    4.  **IUPAC Nomenclature (C8)**: The 'anti' position is assigned the 'r' or 's' descriptor based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. For this system, the 'anti' position corresponds to '8r'.

    The code combines these principles to predict the correct product and compares it to the provided answer.
