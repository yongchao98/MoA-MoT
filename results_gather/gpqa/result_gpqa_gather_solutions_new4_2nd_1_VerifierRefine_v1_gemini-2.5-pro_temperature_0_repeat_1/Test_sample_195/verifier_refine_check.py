    Checks the correctness of the answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.

    1. Symbolically deriving the expression for v_max from the energy conservation principle.
    2. Checking if the derived expression matches option C.
    3. Verifying that option C has the correct classical limit.
    4. Checking for physical and dimensional consistency.
