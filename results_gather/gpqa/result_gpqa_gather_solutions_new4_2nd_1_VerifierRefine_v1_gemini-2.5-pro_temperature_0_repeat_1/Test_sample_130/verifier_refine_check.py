Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Identify the Reactants
*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data (¹H: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are a classic signature for **maleic anhydride**. The molecule's high symmetry means the two alkene protons are equivalent (one ¹H signal), the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (two ¹³C signals in total).
*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.

### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Major Product
*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction forms a bicyclic product and can result in two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.
*   **Careful Point (Stereoselectivity):** The "Alder-endo rule" generally predicts that the *endo* isomer is the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions (an electronic effect). However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups on its face.
    *   An *endo* approach would force the anhydride ring to pass by these bulky methyl groups, creating a severe steric clash.
    *   An *exo* approach, where the anhydride approaches from the less crowded side (the side of the CH₂ bridge), is sterically much more favorable.
*   **Conclusion on Major Product:** In this case, the powerful steric effect dominates the weaker electronic effect of the endo rule. Therefore, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product.

### Step 3: Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Correlations
*   A **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).
*   The question asks for a cross-peak that is present in the **major product** but absent (or weak) in the minor product. We must therefore find a spatial interaction that is unique to the *exo* isomer.
*   **Proton Signal Assignments:**
    *   `~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`: The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.
    *   `~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the newly formed double bond (vinylic methyls).
    *   `~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions.
    *   `~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)`: One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge.
*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**
    *   **In the Major (*Exo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* to the C7 bridge. This geometry places the **anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm)** on the same face of the molecule as the **vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm)**. These two groups are very close in space, and a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.
    *   **In the Minor (*Endo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* to the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons on the opposite face from the vinylic methyl groups, so they are far apart. In this isomer, the anhydride protons are close to the C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm).

### Step 4: Final Conclusion
The question asks for the cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum.
1.  The major product is the **exo** adduct.
2.  The unique spatial interaction in the *exo* adduct is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.
3.  These protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.

This matches option B.
