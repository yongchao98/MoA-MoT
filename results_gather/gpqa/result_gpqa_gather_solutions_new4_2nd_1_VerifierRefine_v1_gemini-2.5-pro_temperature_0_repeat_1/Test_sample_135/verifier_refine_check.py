    Checks the correctness of the answer to the vector calculus problem.

    The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat
    over a sphere of radius R. By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the 
    surface integral of the flux ∮_S (f ⋅ dS).

    The calculation simplifies to the integral of sin(theta) over the surface of a sphere.
    Integral: ∫_{phi=0}^{2π} ∫_{theta=0}^{π} sin(theta) dtheta dphi.
