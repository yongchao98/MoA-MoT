    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, followed by a list of careful points, and the final answer.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    1.  **Identify Particle Type and Governing Principle:** The question specifies four identical **spin-1/2 particles**. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**. As identical fermions, they must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state.

    2.  **Define Quantum States and Occupancy:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal (or spatial) quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). Because there are two possible spin states for each spatial level `n`, each level can hold a maximum of **two** particles.

    3.  **Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are:
        *   `E₁ = 1²E = E`
        *   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`
        *   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`
        *   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`
        *   and so on.

    4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):** To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions according to the Pauli principle.
        *   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is `2 × E₁ = 2E`.
        *   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is `2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E`.
        *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.

    5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):** The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).
        *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.
        *   The total energy is: `E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.

    6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):** The second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We must systematically compare the total energies of all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state.
        *   Ground State Energy: 10E
        *   First Excited State Energy: 15E (from promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3).
        *   **Other possibilities for excitation:**
            *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration is {1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. The total energy is `(1×E) + (2×4E) + (1×9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.
            *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}. The total energy is `(2×E) + (2×9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.
            *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is {2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}. The total energy is `(2×E) + (1×4E) + (1×16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.
        *   Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the **next lowest is 18E**. Therefore, the second excited state energy is 18E.

    ### Careful Points

    *   **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The most critical point is recognizing that spin-1/2 particles are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If they were bosons, all four particles would occupy the `n=1` state, leading to a ground state energy of 4E (which appears as an incorrect option in C and D).
    *   **State Occupancy:** Each spatial energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles due to the two possible spin states. A common mistake is to allow only one particle per level.
    *   **Finding the Second Excited State:** This is the most complex step. It is not necessarily the "next jump" in quantum numbers. One must calculate the total energy for all plausible low-energy configurations and order them. The configuration with the third-lowest total energy is the second excited state. In this case, promoting a particle from `n=1` to `n=3` (total energy 18E) results in a lower total energy than other promotions like `n=2` to `n=4` (total energy 22E).
    *   **Analysis of Agent Answers:** All candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at the sequence 10E, 15E, 18E. The discrepancies in their final letter choices indicate confusion in mapping their result to the options, but the underlying physics calculation is unanimous.

    ### Final Answer

    The calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E, 15E, and 18E**, respectively. This sequence matches option B.
