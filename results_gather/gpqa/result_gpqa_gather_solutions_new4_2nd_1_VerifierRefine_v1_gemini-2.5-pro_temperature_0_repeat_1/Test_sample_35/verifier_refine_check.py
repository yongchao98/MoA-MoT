    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the astrophysics question.
    It follows the logical steps of the problem:
    1. Calculate the redshift (z) from the given distance.
    2. Calculate the rest-frame energy (E_rest) of the absorption line.
    3. Identify the spectral line by comparing E_rest to known transitions.
    4. Identify the corresponding interstellar medium (ISM) component based on the line type (atomic/molecular) and observation method (absorption/emission).
    5. Compare the derived correct option with the provided answer.
