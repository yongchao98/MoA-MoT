    This function performs a dimensional analysis to verify the mass dimension of the coupling
    constant kappa and the renormalizability of the given theory.

    The analysis is based on standard principles of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) in
    4-dimensional spacetime with natural units (hbar = c = 1).

    # --- Step 1: Define fundamental dimensions ---
    # In 4D spacetime, the action S = integral(d^4x * L) must be dimensionless.
    # The mass dimension of the spacetime volume element d^4x is -4.
    # Therefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density L must be 4.
    dim_L = 4.0

    # --- Step 2: Calculate mass dimensions of the fields from their kinetic terms ---
    # The kinetic term for any field must also have a mass dimension of dim_L.

    # Fermion field (psi): from L_kin ~ psi_bar * gamma * partial * psi
    # The dimensional equation is: [L] = 2 * [psi] + [partial]
    # 4 = 2 * [psi] + 1

    # The dimensional equation is: [L] = 2 * [F]
    # 4 = 2 * [F]
    dim_F = dim_L / 2.0
    # Expected result: dim_F = 2.0

    # Sigma tensor (sigma_mu_nu): from sigma = i/2 * [gamma_mu, gamma_nu]
    # Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless constant matrices, their commutator is also dimensionless.
    dim_sigma = 0.0

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant kappa ---
    # The interaction term L_int = kappa * psi_bar * sigma * psi * F must have dimension dim_L.
    # The dimensional equation is: [L_int] = [kappa] + [psi_bar] + [sigma] + [psi] + [F]
    # Note: [psi_bar] = [psi]
    # 4 = [kappa] + 1.5 + 0 + 1.5 + 2
    # 4 = [kappa] + 5
    dim_kappa = dim_L - (dim_psi + dim_sigma + dim_psi + dim_F)
