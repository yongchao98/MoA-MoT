    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most likely explanation.

    **1. Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**
    The most definitive piece of information is that the LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks, but both peaks have the **same mass spectrum**, which is consistent with the expected molecule.
    *   **Careful Point:** This proves that the two chemical species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.
    *   **Conclusion:** This immediately rules out any explanation involving an impurity with a different molecular weight.
        *   **Option A (precursor)** is incorrect because a precursor would have a different (likely lower) mass.
        *   **Option D ('double coupling')** is incorrect because this side reaction would produce a product with a different (higher) mass.

    **2. Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data**
    With options A and D eliminated, we must distinguish between the two remaining types of isomers: enantiomers (B) and diastereoisomers (C).
    *   **Observation:** The sample separates into two clearly defined peaks on the LC column, and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single proton.
    *   **Careful Point:** Standard (achiral) analytical techniques like LC and NMR can only distinguish between molecules that have different physical and chemical properties.
    *   **Evaluating Option B (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.
        *   They would not be separated by a standard LC column (they would elute as a single peak).
        *   They would produce identical NMR spectra (they would show a single set of peaks).
        *   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect as it contradicts both the LC and NMR data.
    *   **Evaluating Option C (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.
        *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography, which explains the two peaks in the LC.
        *   Because they are chemically distinct molecules, their corresponding protons exist in different chemical environments, leading to different signals in the NMR spectrum. This explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.
        *   **Conclusion:** This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental observations.

    **3. Final Synthesis**
    The combined evidence points unequivocally to a mixture of diastereoisomers. The two species have the same mass (confirming they are isomers), but they are separable by chromatography and distinguishable by NMR (ruling out enantiomers and confirming they are diastereoisomers). This is a very common occurrence in peptide synthesis, often due to either partial racemization at one of the chiral centers (epimerization) or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond, both of which create diastereomeric pairs.
