def check_correctness_of_exoplanet_density_answer():

    This function checks the correctness of the provided final answer about exoplanet density.

    The logic is based on two main steps:
    1.  **Physical Principle Verification**: It confirms that for planets of the same composition,
        a more massive planet has a higher density due to gravitational compression. This identifies
        planet description 'c' as the one with the highest density.
    2.  **Mapping Verification**: It uses the mapping explicitly stated in the provided final answer's
        reasoning (A=a, B=d, C=c, D=b) to check if the chosen answer 'C' correctly corresponds
        to the densest planet 'c'.
