Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.

**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept of "Regularization at High Energies"**

The question asks which physical theory does not require "regularization at high energies." This is a key concept in theoretical physics.

*   **The Problem (Ultraviolet Divergence):** In many physical theories, especially those based on point-like particles (like Quantum Field Theories), calculations for interactions at very high energies (which correspond to extremely short distances) often yield infinite results. This problem is known as an "ultraviolet (UV) divergence" and signals that the theory is incomplete or breaks down at these scales.
*   **The Solution (Regularization & Renormalization):** To extract meaningful, finite predictions from these theories, physicists use a two-step process.
    1.  **Regularization:** This is a mathematical technique to temporarily manage the infinities. It involves modifying the theory to make the calculations give a finite answer, often by introducing an artificial "cutoff" parameter that limits the maximum energy considered.
    2.  **Renormalization:** This second step absorbs the infinite parts (which now depend on the cutoff) into the definitions of the theory's fundamental parameters (like the "bare" mass and charge). The final result for observable quantities becomes finite and independent of the artificial cutoff.
*   **The Question's Goal:** The question is asking which of the listed theories is fundamentally constructed in a way that these high-energy (UV) infinities never appear in the first place, making the entire process of regularization unnecessary.

**Step 2: Analyze Each Option**

*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** While not a quantum theory, it has its own famous high-energy/short-distance problem. If you model a charged particle like an electron as a true mathematical point with zero size, the energy stored in its own electric field (its "self-energy") becomes infinite. To get a finite answer, one must "regularize" the problem, for instance, by assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius. Therefore, this theory *does* require a form of regularization.

*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism and is the archetypal example of a theory that *requires* regularization. Calculations involving "loop diagrams" (which represent quantum corrections from virtual particles) lead to UV divergences. The development of regularization and renormalization was a historic triumph that made QED a predictive theory, but the need for these procedures is fundamental to it.

*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory based on point-like particles (quarks and gluons). Its calculations also involve loop diagrams that lead to UV divergences. Therefore, QCD absolutely *requires* regularization and renormalization to be a predictive theory.

*   **B) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a radical departure from the others. A primary motivation for its development was to resolve the problem of infinities that plague quantum field theories, especially when trying to create a quantum theory of gravity. Its fundamental premise is that elementary particles are not points but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating "strings." This extended nature of the fundamental objects is the key. In the other theories, infinities arise from interactions happening at a single, zero-dimensional point in spacetime. In string theory, interactions are "smeared out" over the finite length of the string. This intrinsic smearing naturally smooths out the interactions at very short distances, preventing the ultraviolet divergences from ever appearing. For this reason, superstring theory is believed to be "UV-finite" and does not require regularization for high-energy interactions.

**Step 3: Final Conclusion**

Classical Electrodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics all suffer from infinities related to point-like behavior at high energies/short distances, which must be handled by regularization. Superstring Theory, by its very design, avoids this problem by replacing point particles with extended strings.
