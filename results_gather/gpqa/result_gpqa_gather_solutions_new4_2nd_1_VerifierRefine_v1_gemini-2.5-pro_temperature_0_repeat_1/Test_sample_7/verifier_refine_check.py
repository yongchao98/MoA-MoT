    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by analyzing the genetic data from the question.

    1.  Identifies the upstream transcription factor by checking for epistasis.
    2.  Characterizes the interaction between G1 and G3 (checking for epistasis and synergy/redundancy).
    3.  Evaluates the chosen option ('B') based on the analysis results to see if it's the most logical conclusion.
