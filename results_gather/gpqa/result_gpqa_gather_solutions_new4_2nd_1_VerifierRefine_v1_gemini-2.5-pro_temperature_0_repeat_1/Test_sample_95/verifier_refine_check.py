    # Convert distance from parsecs to meters

    # Convert angular size from degrees to radians
    theta_radians = theta_degrees * (math.pi / 180)

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (Rs) ---
    # The small-angle approximation gives the diameter of the event horizon.
    # Diameter = distance * angular_size_in_radians
    diameter = d_meters * theta_radians

    # The Schwarzschild radius is half the diameter.
    # This is a critical step. Using the diameter instead of the radius is a common error.
