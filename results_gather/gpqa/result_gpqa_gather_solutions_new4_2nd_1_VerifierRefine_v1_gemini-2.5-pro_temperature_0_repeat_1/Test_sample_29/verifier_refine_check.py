    Checks the correctness of the answer to the textile dye question.
    
    The function verifies the following steps:
    1. Calculation of the emitted light's wavelength from its energy.
    2. Identification of the emitted light's color.
    3. Application of the Stokes Shift principle to determine valid absorbed colors.
    4. Selection of the most plausible absorbed color based on typical dye behavior.
    5. Comparison with the provided final answer.
