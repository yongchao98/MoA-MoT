Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided answers.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** When the positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity, it attracts the free electrons within the conducting material. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To determine the total charge on this inner surface (`q_inner`), we apply Gauss's Law. By drawing a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material and enclosing the cavity, we know the electric field on this surface must be zero (as it is inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). Zero field implies zero flux, which in turn implies the net enclosed charge is zero. Therefore, `q + q_inner = 0`, which means `q_inner = -q`.

2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). To conserve charge, if a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.

3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (The Faraday Cage Effect):** This is the most critical principle for this problem. The conducting material acts as a shield, isolating the exterior region from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The combined electric field from the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` resides on the outer surface of the conductor. Because this surface is a sphere and is shielded from the asymmetrically placed charges inside, the `+q` charge will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface. This uniform distribution is the lowest energy state and ensures the outer surface is an equipotential.

5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.
    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.
    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.
    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.

6.  **Final Formula:** Using Coulomb's Law, the magnitude of the electric field is:
    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$

### Careful Points

*   **Electrostatic Shielding is Key:** The most important concept is that the conductor isolates the outside from the inside. The field outside is only due to the charge on the outer surface.
*   **Irrelevant Information:** The parameters describing the cavity's geometry and location (`r`, `s`) and the position of point P relative to the cavity (`l`, `Î¸`) are all distractors. They are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.
*   **Symmetry of the Outer Surface:** The spherical shape of the *outer* surface is crucial. It is this symmetry that ensures the induced charge `+q` distributes uniformly, allowing for the simple point-charge formula to be used.
*   **Correct Distance:** The distance `L` is measured from the center of the *conductor*, not the center of the cavity, because the external field behaves as if the charge `+q` is at the conductor's center.

### Conclusion

The correct analysis, supported by the reasoning in all the detailed candidate answers, leads to the formula $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$. Comparing this to the provided options:

A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$
B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$
C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$
D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$

The derived formula matches option D.
