    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to a chemistry problem.
    It follows a logical, step-by-step analysis of the problem.
    1.  It identifies the starting material (Compound X) from the given IR and NMR data.
    2.  It determines the chemical transformation based on the reagents (Red P/HI).
    3.  It identifies the final product.
    4.  It matches the final product to the given multiple-choice options.
    5.  Finally, it compares this derived correct option with the provided answer.

        # - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Confirms the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
        # - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) & 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.
