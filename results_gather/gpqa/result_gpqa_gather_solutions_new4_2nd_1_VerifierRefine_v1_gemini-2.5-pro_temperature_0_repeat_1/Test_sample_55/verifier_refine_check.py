    # The final consolidated answer from the prompt

    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.

    **1. Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**
    The problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. These transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n, l, m\rangle$:
    *   **Rule for l (Orbital Angular Momentum):** The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\Delta l = \pm 1$.
    *   **Rule for m (Magnetic Quantum Number):** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\Delta m = 0, \pm 1$.
    *   **Rule for n (Principal Quantum Number):** For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).

    **2. Analyze the First Transition Step: Initial to Intermediate State**
    The atom starts in the initial state $|i\rangle = |3,0,0\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\rangle = |n',l',m'\rangle$.
    *   **Initial State:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.
    *   **Applying the $\Delta l$ rule:** Since the initial state has $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$ (because $\Delta l = l' - 0 = \pm 1$, and $l'$ cannot be negative).
    *   **Applying the $\Delta m$ rule:** Since the initial state has $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \text{ or } -1$ (because $\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \pm 1$).
    *   **Applying the $\Delta n$ rule:** The principal quantum number must decrease. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$, which is a valid decay ($2 < 3$).
    *   **Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\rangle$, $|2,1,0\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\rangle$.

    **3. Analyze the Second Transition Step: Intermediate to Final State**
    The atom then decays from the intermediate state $|k\rangle = |2,1,m'\rangle$ to the final state $|f\rangle = |1,0,0\rangle$.
    *   **Intermediate State:** $n'=2, l'=1, m' \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.
    *   **Final State:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.
    *   **Applying the $\Delta l$ rule:** The change is $\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.
    *   **Applying the $\Delta m$ rule:** The change is $\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. For all possible intermediate values of $m'$ (i.e., -1, 0, 1), the resulting $\Delta m$ (+1, 0, -1) is allowed.
    *   **Conclusion for the second step:** All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\rangle$. Therefore, all the transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.

    **4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**
    The question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is the branching ratio for that particular decay path.
    *   **Careful Point:** The probability of the entire cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.
    *   **Probability of the first step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states for this step, $|2,1,-1\rangle$, $|2,1,0\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\rangle$, are degenerate in energy. Due to the symmetry of the initial state, the probability of decaying into any of these three substates is equal. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is **1/3**.
    *   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\rangle$ states, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only possible decay via a single dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step occurring is **1**.
    *   **Total Probability:** The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.
        $P(\text{route}) = P(\text{step 1}) \times P(\text{step 2}) = \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}$.

    **5. Evaluate the Options**
    We have determined that any of the three possible routes has a probability of 1/3. Let's check the given options:
    *   A) $|3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,-1\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.
    *   B) $|3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,1\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.
    *   C) $|3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle$ and $\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.
    *   D) $\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle$ and $\frac{2}{3}$. The route is malformed, and the probability is incorrect.

    Therefore, option C is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.
