    # 1. The luminosity ratio is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
    # L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4
    
    # 2. Calculate the radius component: (R1/R2)^2
    radius_term = radius_ratio**2
    
    # 3. Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2). This requires the Doppler effect.
    # Since observed wavelengths are the same (lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2):
    # lambda_emitted1 = lambda_emitted2 * (1 + v2/c)
    # From Wien's Law, T is proportional to 1/lambda_emitted, so:
    # T1/T2 = lambda_emitted2 / lambda_emitted1
    # T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
    temperature_ratio = 1.0 / (1.0 + v2 / c)
    
    # 4. Calculate the temperature component: (T1/T2)^4
    temperature_term = temperature_ratio**4
    
    # 5. Calculate the final luminosity ratio
    calculated_luminosity_ratio = radius_term * temperature_term
