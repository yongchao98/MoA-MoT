    # For proportionality, we can use the formula plx = 1/r.
    plx_from_r = 1/r

    # 3. Define the given distribution.
    # The problem states "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5".
    # The standard physical interpretation is that this is a number density function.
    # Let n_plx be the number of stars per unit parallax, dN/d(plx).

    # The transformation formula using the chain rule is: n_r = n_plx * |d(plx)/dr|
    # The absolute value of the derivative (the Jacobian) is used because densities are non-negative.
