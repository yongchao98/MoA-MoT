    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    The problem requires us to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl/R_star`) that would produce a light curve signal of the same amplitude as a rotating star with a spotted hemisphere. This can be broken down into two main calculations.

    **1. Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Starspots**

    The brightness (or flux, F) of a star's surface is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).

    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power: `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.
    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere's flux is a weighted average of the normal surface and the cooler spots. A fraction `f` (the filling factor) of the area is at `T_spot`, and the remaining `(1 - f)` is at `T_eff`.
        `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`

    The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux:
    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`

    This simplifies to the key formula:
    `Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`

    Now, we plug in the given values:
    *   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`
    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`
    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`

    `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`
    `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`
    `Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 625/1296]`
    `Amplitude = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]`
    `Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`
    `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`

    The star's brightness varies by approximately 10.36% due to the rotating spotted hemisphere.

    **2. Equate the Spot Amplitude to an Exoplanet Transit Signal**

    The dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet, known as the transit depth, is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.

    `Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`

    To find the exoplanet that produces the same amplitude signal, we set the transit depth equal to the spot-induced amplitude:
    `(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`
    `(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`

    **3. Solve for the Relative Radius**

    To find the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`, we must take the square root of the amplitude:
    `R_pl / R_star = √0.10355`
    `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`

    The calculated relative radius is approximately **0.32**.

    ### Careful Points

    1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The core of the calculation relies on the flux being proportional to the **fourth power** of temperature (`T⁴`). Using a linear or squared relationship would lead to a significantly different and incorrect result.
    2.  **Transit Depth vs. Radius Ratio:** This is the most critical point for potential error. The transit depth is proportional to the *area* ratio, which means it is the *square* of the radius ratio `(R_pl / R_star)²`.
    3.  **The Final Square Root:** A common mistake is to calculate the amplitude (`~0.10355`) and forget to take the square root at the end. This would lead to an answer of `~0.104`, which is very close to option C (`~0.11`), making it a classic distractor.
    4.  **Temperature Calculation:** The spot temperature must be correctly calculated as `T_eff - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`, not simply using the temperature difference of 1000 K.
    5.  **Consistency of Calculation:** All candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at the same numerical result (`~0.32`). The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual prompts, not a disagreement on the physics or math.

    ### Final Answer

    The calculation robustly yields a relative radius `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32`. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:
    A) ~0.39
    B) ~0.32
    C) ~0.11
    D) ~0.07

    The calculated value matches option B.
