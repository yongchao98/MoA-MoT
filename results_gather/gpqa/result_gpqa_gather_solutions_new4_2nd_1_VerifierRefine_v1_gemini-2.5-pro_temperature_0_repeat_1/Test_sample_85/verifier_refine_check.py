def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question.

    The core logic relies on two key principles:
    1. Chemoselectivity of reducing agents:
       - LiBH4 reduces esters, not carboxylic acids.
       - BH3 reduces carboxylic acids, not esters.
    2. Stereochemical consequence (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):
       - The R/S descriptor can change if the priority of the groups attached
         to the chiral center changes, even if the 3D configuration is retained.

    # --- Chemical Analysis ---

    # In the starting material, the chiral center is attached to:
    # - H, -CH2CH3, -CH2COOH (acid side), -CH2COOiBu (ester side)
    # The CIP priority order is: Ester side > Acid side > Ethyl > H.

    # --- Analysis of Reaction A (LiBH4 reduction) ---
    # 1. LiBH4 reduces the ester side to an alcohol side (-CH2CH2OH).
    # 2. The acid side (-CH2COOH) is unchanged.
    # 3. In the intermediate, the acid side now has higher priority than the alcohol side.
    # 4. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped.
    # 5. CONCLUSION: This causes an INVERSION of the R/S descriptor.
    # To get an (R) product, the starting material A must be (S).
    required_config_A = "S"

    # --- Analysis of Reaction B (BH3 reduction) ---
    # 1. BH3 reduces the acid side to an alcohol side (-CH2CH2OH).
    # 2. The ester side (-CH2COOiBu) is unchanged.
    # 3. In the intermediate, the ester side still has higher priority than the alcohol side.
    # 4. The priority order of the groups is maintained.
    # 5. CONCLUSION: This causes a RETENTION of the R/S descriptor.
    # To get an (S) product, the starting material B must be (S).
