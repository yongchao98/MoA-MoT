    # B) Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples
    # C) The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates
    # D) qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples

    if not is_C_true:
        return "Incorrect. The provided answer claims 'The deviation is more than 0.3...' is True, but the code found it to be False. All deviations are within the 0.3 limit."

    # The code confirms that B and C are the only true statements based on the data.
    # The final step is to decide which is the *best* explanation.
    # An inverted standard curve (Option B) is a fundamental, fatal error that invalidates the entire experiment's quantitative purpose.
