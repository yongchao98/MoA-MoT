Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating the careful points identified from the provided answers.

**Step 1: Elucidate the Reaction Sequence to Find the Final Product (E)**

The problem involves a five-step synthesis. Each step must be correctly identified to determine the structure of the final product.

*   **Reaction 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**
    *   This is a protection reaction. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) is protected as a cyclic thioacetal using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT).
    *   Product **A** is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane (or 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane if 1,3-propanedithiol was used, which is common for this reaction type; the final outcome is the same).

*   **Reaction 2: A + BuLi → B**
    *   This is an acid-base reaction. Butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion.
    *   This is a classic example of **umpolung** (polarity inversion), where the carbon that was originally an electrophilic carbonyl carbon is converted into a nucleophile.
    *   Product **B** is the lithiated carbanion of A.

*   **Reaction 3: B + Bromoethane → C**
    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane, adding an ethyl group.
    *   Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane (or dithiane).

*   **Reaction 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**
    *   This is a deprotection reaction. The thioacetal is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl group.
    *   Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product **D** is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.

*   **Reaction 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**
    *   This is a **Wittig reaction**. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, PPh₃, and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D).
    *   The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.
    *   The final product **E** is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.

**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Product E for ¹³C-NMR Signals**

The final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. To find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.

*   **Structure of E:**
    ```
          CH₂CH₃
          |
    CH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃
          |
          CH₂CH₃
    ```

*   **Careful Point 1: Symmetry.** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation through the center of the C=C bond and perpendicular to it. This symmetry makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.

*   **Careful Point 2: Stereoisomerism.** E/Z (geometric) isomerism is not possible for this molecule. For E/Z isomers to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In this case, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, only one structure exists.

*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**
    1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two carbons of the central double bond are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This gives **one signal**.
    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, all four methylene carbons are also equivalent. This gives a **second signal**.
    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃-):** Similarly, all four terminal methyl carbons are equivalent. This gives a **third signal**.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, has three distinct types of carbon atoms. Therefore, it will produce **3** signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.

**Step 4: Match the Result to the Options**

The calculated number of signals is 3. The provided options are:
A) 8
B) 6
C) 11
D) 3

The correct option is D.
