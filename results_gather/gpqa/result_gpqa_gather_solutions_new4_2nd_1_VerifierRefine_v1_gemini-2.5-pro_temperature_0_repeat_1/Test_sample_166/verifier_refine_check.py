    # --- Step-by-step calculation based on the provided analysis ---

    # 1. Simplify the nG measure.
    # nG = S(tau) - S(rho). For a pure state, S(rho) = 0. So, nG = S(tau).
    # We need to calculate the entropy of the reference Gaussian state, S(tau).

    # 2. Calculate the moments of the state rho.
    # For an odd cat state (phi = -pi/4):
    # <a> = 0 (centered Gaussian reference state)
    # <a^2> = alpha^2
    # <n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)
    alpha_sq = alpha**2
    
    # <a^2>
    m_sq = alpha_sq
    
    # <n> = <a_dagger * a>
    # coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / (e^x - e^-x) or cosh(x)/sinh(x)
    coth_alpha_sq = np.cosh(alpha_sq) / np.sinh(alpha_sq)
    n_mean = alpha_sq * coth_alpha_sq

    # 3. Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue 'nu'.
    # nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2
    nu_sq = (n_mean + 0.5)**2 - np.abs(m_sq)**2
    nu = np.sqrt(nu_sq)

    # 4. Calculate the entropy of the reference state, S(tau).
    # S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)
    # This formula can cause issues if nu is close to 0.5, but here nu is ~1.5, so it's safe.
    term1 = (nu + 0.5) * np.log(nu + 0.5)
    term2 = (nu - 0.5) * np.log(nu - 0.5)
    s_tau = term1 - term2
    
    calculated_nG = s_tau

    # 5. Compare the calculated value with the expected answer.
    # We use a tolerance to account for floating-point arithmetic and rounding in the options.
    # A tolerance of 0.01 is reasonable since the option is given to two decimal places.
