def check_correctness():
    """
    This function analyzes the multi-step chemical synthesis to determine the correct final product
    and compares it with the provided answer.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  Define the functional groups of the starting material.
    2.  Simulate each reaction step by transforming the functional groups according to known chemical principles.
    3.  Determine the functional groups of the final product (Product 4).
    4.  Define the functional groups for each of the multiple-choice options.
    5.  Identify which option matches the derived final product.
    6.  Compare this correct option with the provided answer and return the verdict.
