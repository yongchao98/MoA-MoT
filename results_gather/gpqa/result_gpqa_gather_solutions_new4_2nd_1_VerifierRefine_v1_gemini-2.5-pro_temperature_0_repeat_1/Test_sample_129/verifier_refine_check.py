def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the astrophysics redshift question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The question asks for the "lower limit" of redshift for detection by a "ground-based" telescope.
    2. The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) rest wavelength is a known physical constant, ~1216 Angstroms.
    3. The key constraint is the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. The phrase "lower limit" implies using the 
       physical edge of atmospheric transparency, not the start of the human-visible spectrum.
    4. The physical atmospheric cutoff for ground-based astronomy is approximately 3500 Å. A more conservative
       value, representing the start of the visible spectrum, is ~4000 Å.
    5. We calculate the required redshift for both interpretations using the formula: z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1.
    6. We determine which interpretation is more appropriate and check if the selected answer aligns with it.
