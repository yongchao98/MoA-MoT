Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's symmetry.

**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**
*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).
*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to reduced steric hindrance at the para position compared to the ortho positions, the major product formed is p-nitrotoluene.
*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene.

**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**
*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).
*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. This step is the most critical for determining the final product, as there are two plausible outcomes.
    *   **Pathway A (Oxidation to Carboxylic Acid):** The combination of MnO₂ and a strong acid like H₂SO₄ is a powerful oxidizing agent. Chemically, the most expected product is the complete oxidation of the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, yielding p-nitrobenzoic acid.
    *   **Pathway B (Oxidation to Aldehyde):** In the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, the reagents for the subsequent step often provide a clue about the intended intermediate. The next step uses acetone and NaOH, the classic reagents for a Claisen-Schmidt (aldol) condensation, which requires an aldehyde as a reactant. Therefore, it is highly probable that the problem intends for the oxidation to stop at the aldehyde stage.
*   **Decision:** To resolve this ambiguity, we must analyze the consequences of both pathways. If Pathway A is followed, the final product's symmetry group (C₂ᵥ) is not among the given options. This strongly suggests that Pathway B is the intended route.
*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde.

**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**
*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which lacks α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting intermediate alcohol readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of water) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans (E) isomer is the major product due to greater thermodynamic stability.
*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.

**Step 4: Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**
*   **Structure:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, with the structure O₂N—C₆H₄—CH=CH—C(=O)—CH₃.
*   **Symmetry Analysis:**
    1.  **Planarity:** Due to the extensive π-conjugation involving the nitro group, the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group, the heavy-atom framework of the molecule is essentially planar in its most stable conformation.
    2.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane that contains this planar framework is a plane of symmetry. All atoms within the plane are reflected onto themselves.
    3.  **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** The molecule does not possess any C₂ or higher-order rotational axes. The two ends of the molecule are different (a nitrophenyl group vs. an acetyl group), so a 180° rotation cannot leave the molecule unchanged.
    4.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.
*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule with this set of symmetry elements belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.

**Final Answer Determination**
The most logical reaction pathway, which leads to a product whose symmetry group is among the choices, results in (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This molecule has Cₛ symmetry.
