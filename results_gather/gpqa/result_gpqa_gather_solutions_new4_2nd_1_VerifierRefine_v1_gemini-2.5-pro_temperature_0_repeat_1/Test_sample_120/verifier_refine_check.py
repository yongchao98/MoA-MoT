    # The reaction rule states that the nucleophile (Me-) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.
    # The epoxide is between C1 and C6.
    # C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to a methyl group), making it more hindered.
    # C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a hydrogen), making it less hindered.
    # Therefore, the attack must occur at C6.
    
    # An attack at C6 results in a product where the -OH group is on the original C1 and the new methyl group is on the original C6.
    # In IUPAC naming, the C-OH becomes the new C1, and the adjacent C with the new methyl group becomes the new C2.
    # The methyl groups are at positions 1 (original), 2 (new), 4 (original), and 5 (from the original C3).
