Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, considering all the careful points.

### **Careful Points to Consider**

1.  **Stereochemistry of Starting Materials:** It is essential to identify if the starting materials are chiral or achiral, as this dictates the stereochemical outcome of the reactions.
2.  **Creation of New Stereocenters:** Determine if the reactions create new chiral centers and how many.
3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** Correctly identify all the stereoisomers formed (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds) and their relationships.
4.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:** The core of the problem is understanding the difference between achiral (normal-phase) and chiral HPLC.
    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** Separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.
    *   **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):** Uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment. It can separate all unique stereoisomers, including **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.
5.  **Combined Mixture Analysis:** The final count must consider all products from both reactions. It is assumed that structurally distinct molecules (e.g., products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) and diastereomers will not have the same retention time by coincidence.

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

**Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**

*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a **chiral** molecule with one pre-existing stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.
*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a **new stereocenter** at C3.
*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:
    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
*   **Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.

**Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**

*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and **achiral**.
*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBHâ‚„. This creates **two new stereocenters** at C2 and C4.
*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are:
    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).
    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule).
*   **Relationship:** The reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and their diastereomer, the meso compound.

**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**

*   This column separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.
*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.
*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.
    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated, giving **1 peak**.
    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as **1 peak**.
    *   This gives a total of 1 + 1 = **2 peaks** from Reaction II.
*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will be separated.
    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.

**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**

*   This column separates both diastereomers and enantiomers. We simply count the total number of unique stereoisomers.
*   **From Reaction I:** There are **2** unique diastereomers.
*   **From Reaction II:** There are **3** unique stereoisomers (the R,R enantiomer, the S,S enantiomer, and the meso compound).
*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of unique molecules in the mixture is 2 + 3 = **5**. A chiral column can resolve all of them.
    *   Total Peaks = **5 peaks**.

### **Conclusion**

The analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.
