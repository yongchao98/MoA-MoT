Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the provided answers.

**1. Identification of the Physical System**
The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator.
*   **Isotropic:** The potential depends only on the radial distance $r$, meaning the angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is the same in all three Cartesian directions.
*   **Separable Hamiltonian:** The potential can be written as $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This allows the SchrÃ¶dinger equation to be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.

**2. Determination of Energy Eigenvalues**
The energy of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.
For the 3D system, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:
$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$
This simplifies to:
$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$
By defining a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, the energy levels are given by the formula:
$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$

**3. Calculation of the Energy of the Third Excited State**
The energy levels are ordered by the principal quantum number $N$.
*   **Ground State:** $N=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.
*   **First Excited State:** $N=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.
*   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.
*   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$.

To find the energy of the third excited state, we substitute $N=3$ into the energy formula:
$E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.

**4. Calculation of the Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**
The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (i.e., combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state ($N=3$), we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.

*   **Method 1: Direct Enumeration**
    1.  Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> **3 states**
    2.  Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) -> **6 states**
    3.  The combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) -> **1 state**
    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.

*   **Method 2: Using the Formula**
    The degeneracy $g_N$ for the N-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:
    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$
    For the third excited state ($N=3$):
    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.

Both methods confirm that there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.

**Careful Points:**
*   The ground state corresponds to $N=0$, not $N=1$. Therefore, the third excited state is $N=3$.
*   The energy formula for the 3D case has a zero-point energy of $(3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, not $(1/2)\\hbar\\omega$.
*   The energy expressions involving $1/r^2$ are distractors; they correspond to a different physical system (like a particle in an infinite spherical well).
*   The degeneracy of 3 corresponds to the first excited state ($N=1$), not the third.

**Final Conclusion**
The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10. Comparing this with the provided options:
A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10
B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10
C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3
D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3

The calculated result matches option A.
