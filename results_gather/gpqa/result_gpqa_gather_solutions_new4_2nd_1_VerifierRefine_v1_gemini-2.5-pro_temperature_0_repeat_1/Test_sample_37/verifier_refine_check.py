    # --- Step 1: Define Chemical Principles for the Reaction ---

    # The reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation of an iminium salt derived from pentan-2-one.
    # The reaction proceeds in three main steps:
    # 1. Deprotonation with a bulky base (LDA).
    # 2. Alkylation with an electrophile (ethyl iodide).
    # 3. Hydrolysis with acid (H3O+).

    # Principle 1: Correct Product
    # The starting ketone is pentan-2-one, which has two alpha-carbons (C1 and C3).
    # The base used is LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide), which is sterically bulky.
    # Due to its bulk, LDA preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon.
    # In pentan-2-one (CH3(C1)-C(=O)-CH2(C3)-CH2-CH3), the C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group.
    # Therefore, alkylation occurs at C1.
    # The alkylating agent is ethyl iodide, which adds an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).
    # The original C1 methyl group becomes a propyl group (CH3-CH2-CH2-).
    # The final product is CH3CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is named heptan-4-one.
    correct_product = "heptan-4-one"

    # Principle 2: Correct Reagent Sequence
    # The reaction must be stepwise. The base, alkylating agent, and acid must be added in separate, sequential steps.
    # A correct sequence will be formatted like: (i) ..., (ii) ..., (iii) ...
    # An incorrect sequence will group reagents from different steps, e.g., adding H3O+ in step (ii).
