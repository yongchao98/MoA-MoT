    # Part A: Which compound does NOT show tautomerism?
    # - Benzoquinone: Lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp3 carbon, so it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. This is the correct answer for A.
    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Has acidic alpha-hydrogens on sp3 carbons between two carbonyl groups. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is aromatic and highly stable. It does show tautomerism.

    # Part B: Which compound WILL show optical isomerism?
    # - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Has a chiral carbon (the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3). It is chiral and will show optical isomerism. This is the correct answer for B.
    # - Dimethyl fumarate: This is a trans-alkene. It is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It will not show optical isomerism.

    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.

    **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**

    The first part of the question asks to identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.

    1.  **Careful Point:** The key concept is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit this type of tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen), and the carbon it is attached to is typically sp³ hybridized.

    2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**
        *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone has a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.
        *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.
        *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.

    3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**
        *   **Structure:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups, situated between the carbonyls.
        *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These CH₂ groups contain alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.
        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is exceptionally stable due to being an aromatic compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.

    **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

    ---

    **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**

    The second part of the question asks to identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.

    1.  **Careful Point:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.

    2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**
        *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
        *   **Chiral Center:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:
            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)
            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)
            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)
            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)
        *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.

    3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**
        *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).
        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers. Any molecule with a plane or center of symmetry is achiral.
        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.

    **Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    ---

    **Final Conclusion**

    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.
    *   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    This combination corresponds to option B.
