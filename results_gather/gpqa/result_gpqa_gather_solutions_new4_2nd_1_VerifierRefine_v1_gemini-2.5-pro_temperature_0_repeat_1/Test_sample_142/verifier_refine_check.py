    # --- Part 1: Analysis of Reaction 1 to determine Starting Material 'A' ---
    # Reaction: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one
    # Principle: The product is a cyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring ketone).
    # In Pinacol rearrangements involving cyclic systems, ring expansion is a common and favorable process
    # if it leads to a more stable ring (e.g., from a strained 5-membered ring to a 6-membered ring).
    # If the starting material 'A' had a 6-membered ring (cyclohexane), a ring expansion would lead to a
    # 7-membered ring (cycloheptanone), which does not match the product.
    # Therefore, the starting material 'A' must have a 5-membered ring that expands.
    correct_A = "1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol"

    # --- Part 2: Analysis of Reaction 2 to determine Product 'B' ---
    # Reaction: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 ---> B
    # Starting Material Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-COOCH3
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The reaction proceeds via the most stable carbocation.
    # The -OH on C2 will leave because it forms a tertiary, benzylic carbocation, which is much more
    # stable than the secondary carbocation that would form at C3.
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): A group from the adjacent carbon (C3) migrates to the carbocation at C2.
    # The groups on C3 are a hydrogen (H) and a methyl group (CH3). The established order of migratory
    # aptitude is H > alkyl. Therefore, a 1,2-hydride shift occurs.
    # The ketone then forms at C3.
    # Resulting Product Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3
