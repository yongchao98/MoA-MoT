    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to an organic chemistry question.
    It verifies the answer based on established chemical principles:
    1. Stoichiometry: The products of an intramolecular cyclization should be isomers of the reactant.
    2. Reaction Mechanism Plausibility: The reaction follows predictable pathways, including Markovnikov's rule, carbocation stability (favoring rearrangements to more stable carbocations), and the high favorability of forming stable 5- or 6-membered rings via intramolecular reactions.
    3. Consistency with Observation: The formation of two products matches the two competing pathways.
