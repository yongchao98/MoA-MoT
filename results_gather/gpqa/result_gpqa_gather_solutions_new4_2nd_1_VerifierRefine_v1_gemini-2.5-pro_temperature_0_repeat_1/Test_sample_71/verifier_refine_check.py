    # Step 4: Thermal fragmentation (retro-Diels-Alder) and subsequent reactions.
    # This is the crucial step. Heating Product 3 causes a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction.
    # Fragments:
    #   - One molecule of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, which loses CO to form benzene.
    #   - Two molecules of o-quinodimethane (a highly reactive diene).
    
    # Fate of o-quinodimethane: This reactive intermediate cannot be isolated. At high temperature and
    # concentration (as it's generated from a single precursor molecule), it rapidly dimerizes.
    # The major thermal dimerization product is dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene.

    # Symmetry: The most stable conformations possess C2 symmetry (a single two-fold rotation axis).
    # A molecule with only C2 symmetry has no mirror planes.
    
    # Counting Aromatic Hydrogens:
    # There are two benzene rings, made equivalent by the C2 axis.
    # Within a single benzene ring, the four protons are all in unique chemical environments because there are no
    # other symmetry elements (like a mirror plane) that would make them equivalent.
    # Therefore, there are 4 distinct types of aromatic hydrogens.

    # Counting Aliphatic Hydrogens:
    # There are four -CH2- groups in the central eight-membered ring.
    # The C2 axis relates these groups in pairs, so there are two non-equivalent types of -CH2- groups.
    # Within each -CH2- group, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent) due to the
    # overall chiral, puckered environment of the molecule.
    # This results in 2 (non-equivalent CH2 types) * 2 (diastereotopic protons per CH2) = 4 distinct types.
