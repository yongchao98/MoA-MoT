When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?

A review of the candidate answers shows that while most of them performed the calculation correctly to arrive at ~4.5, many made errors in mapping this result to the correct lettered option. The correct calculation consistently points to ~4.5.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Core Task**: The goal is to find the factor by which the population ratio of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K due to starspots.\n2.  **Governing Physics**: The problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In this condition, the relative population of atomic energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n3.  **Key Information**:\n    *   Temperature without spots (T_nospots): 6000 K\n    *   Overall effective temperature with spots (T_spots): 5500 K\n    *   Transition wavelength (λ): 1448 Å (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m)\n4.  **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage are contextual details. They are not needed for the calculation because the resulting effective temperatures for both scenarios are explicitly provided.\n5.  **The Factor to Calculate**: We need to find the ratio of the population ratios: `Factor = (Population Ratio at 6000 K) / (Population Ratio at 5500 K)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Boltzmann vs. Saha Equation**: The question is about the ratio of populations *within the neutral state* of Titanium. The Boltzmann equation governs this. The Saha equation, which describes the ratio of ionized to neutral atoms, is not needed.\n*   **Which Ratio?**: The problem states the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases with temperature. This implies that the ratio being discussed is that of the higher energy level population to the lower energy level population (N_upper / N_lower). As temperature drops, fewer atoms are excited to the upper level, so this ratio decreases.\n*   **Formula for the Factor**: The population ratio is given by `R = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (kT))`. The factor we need is `R_nospots / R_spots`. The statistical weight term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out, leaving:\n    `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k)**:\n    The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the Planck-Einstein relation `ΔE = hc/λ`. We need the term `ΔE/k`.\n    *   `ΔE/k = hc / (λk)`\n    *   Using the constants:\n        *   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n        *   λ (wavelength) = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `ΔE/k = (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.381e-23) ≈ 99440 K`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Temperature Term**:\n    *   `(1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000)`\n    *   `= (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Factor**:\n    *   `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n    *   `Factor = exp[ 99440 * (1 / 66000) ]`\n    *   `Factor = exp(1.5066...)`\n    *   `Factor ≈ 4.51`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This means the ratio of the population of the higher energy level to the lower energy level is about 4.5 times greater in the hotter, unspotted star than in the cooler, spotted star. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~1.1\nB) ~4.5\nC) ~2.9\nD) ~7.8\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.

The information about the star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage is extraneous, as the problem provides the necessary effective temperatures for both scenarios.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physical Principle\nThe question asks about the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels. For a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), like a stellar photosphere, this is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Boltzmann Equation\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is:\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\nwhere:\n*   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels (a constant for this transition).\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (`E₂ - E₁`).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 3. Interpret the Problem Statement\nThe problem states that the ratio of atoms in the two levels *decreases* when the star has spots. Spots cause the temperature to decrease (from 6000 K to 5500 K). As the temperature `T` decreases, the term `-ΔE/(kT)` becomes more negative, causing the exponential term `exp(-ΔE/(kT))` to decrease. This matches the description in the problem, confirming that the ratio in question is indeed `N₂/N₁` (higher level population over lower level population).\n\n### 4. Set Up the Calculation for the Factor\nThe question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the population ratios:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\text{Ratio at } T_{\\text{nospots}}}{\\text{Ratio at } T_{\\text{spots}}} = \\frac{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{nospots}}}{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{spots}}} $$\nThe temperatures are:\n*   `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spots` = 5500 K\n\nPlugging in the Boltzmann equation:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{nospots}}}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spots}}}}} $$\nThe statistical weight term `g₂/g₁` cancels out. Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{nospots}}} - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spots}}})} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right)} $$\nThis formula is correctly derived by the majority of the candidate answers.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Numerical Value\nThe calculation requires two parts: the energy term `ΔE/k` and the temperature term.\n\n*   **Energy Term (`ΔE/k`)**: The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition wavelength `λ` by `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{hc}{k\\lambda} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^8)}{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (1.448 \\times 10^{-7})} \\approx 99400 \\text{ K} $$\n    This value is consistently calculated across the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Temperature Term**:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66000} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n\n*   **Final Factor**:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = e^{99400 \\times \\frac{1}{66000}} = e^{1.506} \\approx 4.508 $$\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculation robustly yields a factor of approximately **4.5**.

Now I will analyze the candidate answers in light of this result.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Physics Principle**: The problem requires the use of the Boltzmann equation to find the ratio of atomic populations at two different temperatures. The factor is the ratio of these two population ratios:\n    `Factor = Ratio(T=6000K) / Ratio(T=5500K)`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n    where `ΔE = hc/λ`. Almost all candidate answers correctly identify and apply this formula.\n\n2.  **Calculation**: The inputs are `T_nospots = 6000 K`, `T_spots = 5500 K`, and `λ = 1448 Å`. My own calculation, as well as the calculations in the vast majority of the candidate answers (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17), yields a numerical result of **~4.51**. There is a strong consensus on this value.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**:\n    *   **Correct Calculation, Correct Answer**: Answers 3, 5, 16, and 17 all correctly calculate the factor to be ~4.5 and correctly map this to option **A**.\n    *   **Correct Calculation, Incorrect Answer**: A large number of answers (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14) correctly calculate the factor to be ~4.5 but then select an incorrect option (B, C, or D). This indicates a flaw in their final step of matching the result to the provided options. For example, Answer 1 calculates 4.51 but chooses D (~1.1). Answer 7 calculates 4.506 but chooses B (~7.8).\n    *   **No Calculation/Reasoning**: Answer 12 provides an answer without any justification.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The physical reasoning and mathematical calculation are consistent across nearly all solutions, leading to a factor of approximately 4.5. The discrepancies arise from a failure in some agents to correctly associate this numerical result with the corresponding option letter. The agents that perform the entire process correctly (calculation and selection) unanimously arrive at option A.\n\nTherefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is ~4.5.\n\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated factor is: 4.506\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Governing Physical Principle\nThe problem asks about the population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship that governs the relative number of atoms in different energy states under these conditions is the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n### 2.

In this condition, the relative population of atomic energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n3.  **Key Information**:\n    *   Temperature without spots (T_nospots): 6000 K\n    *   Overall effective temperature with spots (T_spots): 5500 K\n    *   Transition wavelength (λ): 1448 Å (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m)\n4.  **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage are contextual details. They are not needed for the calculation because the resulting effective temperatures for both scenarios are explicitly provided.\n5.  **The Factor to Calculate**: We need to find the ratio of the population ratios: `Factor = (Population Ratio at 6000 K) / (Population Ratio at 5500 K)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Boltzmann vs. Saha Equation**: The question is about the ratio of populations *within the neutral state* of Titanium. The Boltzmann equation governs this. The Saha equation, which describes the ratio of ionized to neutral atoms, is not needed.\n*   **Which Ratio?**: The problem states the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases with temperature. This implies that the ratio being discussed is that of the higher energy level population to the lower energy level population (N_upper / N_lower). As temperature drops, fewer atoms are excited to the upper level, so this ratio decreases.\n*   **Formula for the Factor**: The population ratio is given by `R = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (kT))`. The factor we need is `R_nospots / R_spots`. The statistical weight term `(g₂/g₁)` cancels out, leaving:\n    `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k)**:\n    The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the Planck-Einstein relation `ΔE = hc/λ`. We need the term `ΔE/k`.\n    *   `ΔE/k = hc / (λk)`\n    *   Using the constants:\n        *   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n        *   λ (wavelength) = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `ΔE/k = (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.381e-23) ≈ 99440 K`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Temperature Term**:\n    *   `(1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000)`\n    *   `= (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Factor**:\n    *   `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n    *   `Factor = exp[ 99440 * (1 / 66000) ]`\n    *   `Factor = exp(1.5066...)`\n    *   `Factor ≈ 4.51`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.

The relationship that governs the population of these energy levels is the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}} $$\n\nwhere:\n*   $N_2$ and $N_1$ are the number of atoms in the higher energy level (level 2) and lower energy level (level 1), respectively.\n*   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels, which are constant for a given transition.\n*   $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Define the Factor to be Calculated**\nThe question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures:\n\n*   Temperature without spots: $T_{nospots} = 6000$ K\n*   Overall effective temperature with spots: $T_{spots} = 5500$ K\n\nThe factor is:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{nospots}}}{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{spots}}} $$\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann equation:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_{nospots}}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_{spots}}}} $$\n\nThe statistical weight term $\\frac{g_2}{g_1}$ cancels out. Using the property of exponents ($e^a / e^b = e^{a-b}$), the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_{nospots}} - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_{spots}})} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{nospots}}\\right)} $$\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Term ($\\Delta E/k$)**\nThe energy difference $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength $\\lambda = 1448$ Å. The energy is given by the Planck-Einstein relation, $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda$. We need the term $\\Delta E/k$:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{hc}{k\\lambda} $$\n\nUsing the standard values for the physical constants:\n*   $h$ (Planck's constant) $\\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n*   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $k$ (Boltzmann constant) $\\approx 1.381 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K\n*   $\\lambda = 1448$ Å $= 1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m\n\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8)}{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (1448 \\times 10^{-10})} \\approx 99400 \\text{ K} $$\n\n**4.

Conclusion**\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This matches option B. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage is extraneous, as the problem provides the necessary effective temperatures for both scenarios.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physical Principle\nThe question asks about the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels. For a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), like a stellar photosphere, this is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Boltzmann Equation\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is:\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\nwhere:\n*   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels (a constant for this transition).\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (`E₂ - E₁`).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 3. Interpret the Problem Statement\nThe problem states that the ratio of atoms in the two levels *decreases* when the star has spots. Spots cause the temperature to decrease (from 6000 K to 5500 K). As the temperature `T` decreases, the term `-ΔE/(kT)` becomes more negative, causing the exponential term `exp(-ΔE/(kT))` to decrease. This matches the description in the problem, confirming that the ratio in question is indeed `N₂/N₁` (higher level population over lower level population).\n\n### 4. Set Up the Calculation for the Factor\nThe question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the population ratios:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\text{Ratio at } T_{\\text{nospots}}}{\\text{Ratio at } T_{\\text{spots}}} = \\frac{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{nospots}}}{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{spots}}} $$\nThe temperatures are:\n*   `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spots` = 5500 K\n\nPlugging in the Boltzmann equation:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{nospots}}}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spots}}}}} $$\nThe statistical weight term `g₂/g₁` cancels out. Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{nospots}}} - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spots}}})} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right)} $$\nThis formula is correctly derived by the majority of the candidate answers.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Numerical Value\nThe calculation requires two parts: the energy term `ΔE/k` and the temperature term.\n\n*   **Energy Term (`ΔE/k`)**: The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition wavelength `λ` by `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{hc}{k\\lambda} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^8)}{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (1.448 \\times 10^{-7})} \\approx 99400 \\text{ K} $$\n    This value is consistently calculated across the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Temperature Term**:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66000} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n\n*   **Final Factor**:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = e^{99400 \\times \\frac{1}{66000}} = e^{1.506} \\approx 4.508 $$\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculation robustly yields a factor of approximately **4.5**. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is not needed for the calculation, as the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided directly.\n\nComparing the result to the given options:\nA) ~4.5\nB) ~7.8\nC) ~1.1\nD) ~2.9\n\nThe calculated value of ~4.5 directly matches option A.

Now I will analyze the candidate answers in light of this result.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Core Physics Principle**: The problem requires the use of the Boltzmann equation to find the ratio of atomic populations at two different temperatures. The factor is the ratio of these two population ratios:\n    `Factor = Ratio(T=6000K) / Ratio(T=5500K)`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n    where `ΔE = hc/λ`. Almost all candidate answers correctly identify and apply this formula.\n\n2.  **Calculation**: The inputs are `T_nospots = 6000 K`, `T_spots = 5500 K`, and `λ = 1448 Å`. My own calculation, as well as the calculations in the vast majority of the candidate answers (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17), yields a numerical result of **~4.51**. There is a strong consensus on this value.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**:\n    *   **Correct Calculation, Correct Answer**: Answers 3, 5, 16, and 17 all correctly calculate the factor to be ~4.5 and correctly map this to option **A**.\n    *   **Correct Calculation, Incorrect Answer**: A large number of answers (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14) correctly calculate the factor to be ~4.5 but then select an incorrect option (B, C, or D). This indicates a flaw in their final step of matching the result to the provided options. For example, Answer 1 calculates 4.51 but chooses D (~1.1). Answer 7 calculates 4.506 but chooses B (~7.8).\n    *   **No Calculation/Reasoning**: Answer 12 provides an answer without any justification.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The physical reasoning and mathematical calculation are consistent across nearly all solutions, leading to a factor of approximately 4.5. The discrepancies arise from a failure in some agents to correctly associate this numerical result with the corresponding option letter.

The governing principle for this is the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n\nwhere:\n*   $N_2$ and $N_1$ are the number of atoms in the higher (level 2) and lower (level 1) energy states.\n*   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature.\n\n**2. Interpret the Observational Clue**\nThe problem states that the ratio \"decreases when the star has spots.\" Spots cause the temperature to decrease (from 6000 K to 5500 K). For the ratio $N_2/N_1$ to decrease as temperature $T$ decreases, the exponent $-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}$ must become more negative. This is indeed what happens, confirming that the ratio in question is that of the higher energy level population to the lower energy level population ($N_2/N_1$).\n\n**3. Set Up the Calculation for the Factor**\nThe question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\" This means we need to calculate the ratio of the population ratios:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{no spots}}}{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{with spots}}} = \\frac{R(T_{\\text{no spots}})}{R(T_{\\text{with spots}})} $$\n\nLet $T_{\\text{no spots}} = 6000$ K and $T_{\\text{with spots}} = 5500$ K.\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spots}}}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{with spots}}}}} $$\n\nThe statistical weight term $\\frac{g_2}{g_1}$ cancels out. Using the property of exponents $e^a / e^b = e^{a-b}$, we get:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spots}}} - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{with spots}}})} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{with spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spots}}}\\right)} $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Term ($\\Delta E/k$)**\nThe energy difference $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the given transition wavelength $\\lambda = 1448$ Å. We can calculate $\\Delta E/k$ directly using the formula $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda$.\n\n*   $h$ (Planck's constant) ≈ $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n*   $c$ (speed of light) ≈ $3.0 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n*   $\\lambda$ = 1448 Å = $1.448 \\times 10^{-7}$ m\n*   $k$ (Boltzmann constant) ≈ $1.381 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K\n\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{hc}{k\\lambda} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^8)}{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (1.448 \\times 10^{-7})} \\approx 99400 \\text{ K} $$\nAll candidate answers that perform this calculation arrive at a very similar value.\n\n**5.
