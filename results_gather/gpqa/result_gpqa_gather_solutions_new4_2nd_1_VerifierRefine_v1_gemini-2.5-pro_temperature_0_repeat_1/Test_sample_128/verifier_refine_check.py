    # Step 1: Identify Compound A using Hint (a).
    # Hint (a) describes a Wittig reaction product: '1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane'.
    # A retro-Wittig analysis involves replacing the ylide part ('=C(CH3)2') with a carbonyl ('=O').
    # This gives a ketone at position 4 of a 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane.
    # According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbonyl carbon gets the lowest number (C1).
    # Renumbering the ring to give substituents the lowest locants places the methyl groups at C3 and C4.

    # Step 2: Verify Compound A with the IR hint (b).

    # strained 5-membered ring ketone (cyclopentanone).

    # Step 3: Deduce Compound E from the reaction sequence.
    # The sequence is:
    # A (ketone) -> B (cyanohydrin) -> C (1-aminomethyl-cycloalkanol) -> D (diazonium salt) -> E (rearranged ketone)
    # This is a known named reaction: the Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement.
    # The key outcome of this rearrangement is a one-carbon ring expansion.
    # Therefore, the 5-membered ring of Compound A expands to a 6-membered ring in Compound E.
    # The substituents (3,4-dimethyl) are carried over.

    # less-strained 6-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone).
