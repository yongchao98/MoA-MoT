    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by systematically applying
    the constraints from the chemistry problem.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  Calculate the required Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) based on the described
        structural features (aromatic ring, ester, vinyl group).
    2.  Filter the given chemical formula options to find those that match the required DoU.
    3.  Assemble the molecular formula from the fragments identified by the detailed
        Â¹H NMR data (aromatic ring, propenyl group, methyl ester part).
    4.  Compare the formula deduced from the fragments with the options that passed the
        DoU check.
    5.  Verify that the final selected option does not violate any constraints, especially
        the "no -CH2- groups" rule.
    6.  Compare the code's conclusion with the LLM's provided answer.
