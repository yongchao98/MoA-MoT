    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum electrostatic potential energy of a system of 13 charges.
    - 1 charge at the center of a sphere.
    - 12 charges on the surface of the sphere (radius r = 2m).
    - All charges are identical: q = 2e.

    The total energy U_total is the sum of:
    1. U_cs: Interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges.
    2. U_ss: Mutual interaction energy of the 12 shell charges.

    To minimize energy, the 12 shell charges form a regular icosahedron (Thomson problem for N=12).

    The formula for the total energy is:
    U_total = U_cs + U_ss
            = 12 * (k * q^2 / r) + E_12 * (k * q^2 / r)
            = (12 + E_12) * (k * q^2 / r)
    where E_12 is a dimensionless constant for the icosahedron, approximately 49.165.
