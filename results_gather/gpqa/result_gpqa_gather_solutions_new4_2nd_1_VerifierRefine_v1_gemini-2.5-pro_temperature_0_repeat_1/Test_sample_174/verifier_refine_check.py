    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Correct Physical Model:**
        The problem describes an "oscillating charge distribution" with a spheroid shape and a symmetry axis (z-axis). The key first step is to model this source of radiation.
        *   **Electric Dipole Model:** The most fundamental and typically dominant form of radiation from a compact, oscillating charge distribution is electric dipole radiation. This arises from a time-varying separation of charge, creating an oscillating electric dipole moment. For an oscillation along the z-axis, this is the most natural and expected model.
        *   **Electric Quadrupole Model:** A higher-order form of radiation that would only dominate if the electric dipole moment were zero due to a specific symmetry (e.g., a shape deformation where the center of charge remains fixed).
        *   **Conclusion on Model:** The overwhelming consensus among the candidate answers is to use the electric dipole model. This is the standard approach in physics unless specific conditions forbidding dipole radiation are stated. Therefore, we model the source as an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis.

    2.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**
        For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`), which the problem calls `f`, is not uniform. It has a characteristic angular dependence:
        `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`
        where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).

    3.  **Calculate the Fraction of Maximum Power:**
        *   The maximum power per unit solid angle, `A`, is radiated where the `sin²(θ)` term is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation).
        *   We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°` as a fraction of `A`. The power at this angle is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.
        *   Using the standard trigonometric value `sin(30°) = 1/2`.
        *   The power is proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.
        *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:
            Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = `(proportional to 1/4) / (proportional to 1) = 1/4`.

    4.  **Determine the Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**
        *   The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation. The formula for radiated power shows that it is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω⁴`).
        *   The angular frequency `ω` is inversely proportional to the wavelength `λ` (`ω = 2πc/λ`).
        *   Substituting this relationship into the power dependence gives:
            `Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.
        *   Therefore, a possible form for the function `f` includes a dependence on `λ⁻⁴`.

    ### Careful Points to Note

    *   **Model Choice:** The most critical decision is to model the system as an electric dipole. The alternative, an electric quadrupole, would lead to the answer `(3/4, λ⁻⁶)`, which matches option C, but this is a less fundamental and less likely scenario.
    *   **Squaring the Sine:** A very common mistake is to forget that the power is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, not `sin(θ)`. This means the value of `sin(30°) = 1/2` must be squared to get the correct factor of `1/4`.
    *   **Frequency vs. Wavelength:** The power is proportional to `ω⁴`. It is essential to correctly convert this to wavelength dependence using `ω ∝ 1/λ`, which results in the `λ⁻⁴` relationship characteristic of dipole radiation (and Rayleigh scattering).
    *   **Matching to Options:** The candidate answers show significant confusion in matching their correct physical derivation to the lettered options, likely due to scrambled option lists. It is crucial to carefully match the derived pair `(1/4, λ⁻⁴)` to the options provided in the question.

    ### Final Conclusion

    The analysis consistently shows that the fraction of maximum power radiated at 30° is **1/4**, and the wavelength dependence is **λ⁻⁴**. We now match this result to the given options:

    A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴
    B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴
    C) 3/4, λ⁻⁶
    D) 1/4, λ⁻³

    The derived pair `(1/4, λ⁻⁴)` perfectly matches option A.
