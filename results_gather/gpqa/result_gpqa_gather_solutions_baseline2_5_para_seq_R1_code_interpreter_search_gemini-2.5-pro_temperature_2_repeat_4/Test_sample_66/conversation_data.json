The correct answer can be found by applying a fundamental conservation law. Here is a step-by-step analysis based on the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (they are in p-orbitals).\n    *   $l=2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n    *   **m = -1**: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum and obtaining a specific result:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired outcome would place the system in an *uncoupled basis* state.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: The core physical principle governing the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of its z-component. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of (and therefore can only be measured to be in) uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to `m`. If this condition is not met, the measurement outcome is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must apply this selection rule to the problem to see if the desired outcome is possible.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the required total `m` from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`). Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically forbidden. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute**: The rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is a strict, inviolable consequence of the conservation of angular momentum. If the rule is violated, the probability of the event is exactly zero, not just small.\n*   **No Need for Complex Calculations**: This problem appears to involve Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which relate the coupled and uncoupled bases. However, one does not need to look up or calculate any coefficients. By definition, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is zero unless the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is satisfied. The violation of this rule immediately provides the answer.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: A more formal way to understand this is to recognize that the initial state is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state would be an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state to be in another state that is orthogonal to it is zero.\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning**: All the provided candidate answers correctly identify and apply this reasoning, unanimously concluding that the probability is 0. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicate that the options were presented to them in a different order, but the core physical analysis is sound and consistent.\n\nBased on the unambiguous physical reasoning, the joint probability is 0. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the system.\n    *   **$m=-1$**: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. Any measurement of the total z-component must yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ with 100% certainty.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the probability of a specific joint measurement on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule)**: The core physical principle governing this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict and absolute **selection rule** for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n    This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be measured in an uncoupled state where the sum of the individual quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is exactly equal to `m`. If this rule is not satisfied, the probability of that measurement outcome is exactly zero.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now apply the selection rule to see if the desired outcome is physically possible.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   Comparing the initial requirement with the final outcome: Is $-1 = -2$? No, the equality is false.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability**: The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. The probability of a physically impossible event is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute**: The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not an approximation; it is an exact consequence of how angular momentum is defined. Its violation means the probability is precisely zero, not just small. This rule is a powerful tool that often allows for solving problems without more complex calculations.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: This provides a more formal explanation. The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$, is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system transitioning to a state orthogonal to itself upon measurement is zero.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**: Formally, the probability is given by the squared magnitude of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which connects the initial (coupled) and final (uncoupled) bases: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$. These coefficients are zero by definition if the selection rule $m=m_1+m_2$ is violated.\n*   **Unanimity of Reasoning**: All candidate answers correctly identified this reasoning, showing a strong consensus on the underlying physics. The discrepancies in their final lettered choices are a result of being presented with differently ordered options, not any confusion about the correct numerical answer.\n\nThe analysis robustly shows the probability is 0. Matching this to the options given in the question:\nA) 1\nB) 2/3\nC) 1/2\nD) 0\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the candidate answers and adding key points for clarity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is described in the coupled basis by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Let's break down this notation:\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: Each electron has an individual orbital angular momentum quantum number of 1.\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the combined two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement outcome on the individual electrons' angular momenta. This is described in the uncoupled basis.\n    *   The measured eigenvalue for the first electron's $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measured eigenvalue for the second electron's $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule):** A core principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component operator is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers. For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers in the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state.\n    **Selection Rule:** `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying this rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be **m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** We compare the total quantum number required by the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`). Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of this measurement occurring is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The Power of the Selection Rule:** The entire problem is solvable by simply checking the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. The other quantum numbers ($l_1, l_2, l$) are not needed for this specific question. Any outcome violating this rule has zero probability.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem highlights the difference between the coupled basis $|l, m\\rangle$, where the system's total angular momentum is defined, and the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, where the individual components are defined. The probability of transitioning from the former to the latter is what's being calculated.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal way to state the same principle is that the initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1$) is an eigenstate of the same operator but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of one state being measured in a state orthogonal to it is zero.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is formally given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. These coefficients are zero by definition if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, confirming that the probability is zero without any need for calculation.\n\nGiven the unambiguous result that the probability is 0, we select the corresponding option.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The two-electron system is described in the *coupled basis* by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The essential information to extract from this notation is:\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n    *   **$m=-1$**: This is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron:\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being found in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ also yields an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being found in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** A core principle in the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a strict and absolute **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule dictates that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number *m* can only be a superposition of, and therefore can only be measured to be in, uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to *m*.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must apply the selection rule to determine if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is fixed: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** We compare the value of $m$ from the initial state with the value of $m_1 + m_2$ from the desired final state. The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$. For this problem, that means checking if $-1 = -2$. This statement is **false**. Since the desired outcome violates a fundamental conservation law of physics, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identify the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum and the resulting selection rule ($m = m_1 + m_2$) as the decisive factor. They all correctly apply it and conclude that the probability is 0.\n*   **Selection Rule as a First Principle:** The selection rule serves as an immediate check that resolves the problem without complex calculations. One does not need to compute Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the full basis expansion; knowing they are zero if the selection rule is violated is sufficient.\n*   **Formal Justifications:**\n    *   **Orthogonality:** The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$) is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state in another state orthogonal to it is zero.\n    *   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability of this transition is formally given by the square of the magnitude of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. These coefficients are zero by definition if the condition $m = m_1+m_2$ is not met.\n*   **Irrelevance of Some Information:** While the values of total angular momentum ($l_1, l_2, l$) must be consistent with the rules of angular momentum addition (i.e., $|l_1-l_2| \\le l \\le l_1+l_2$, which is satisfied since $|1-1| \\le 2 \\le 1+1$), they are not needed to solve this specific question, which is decided solely by the magnetic quantum numbers.\n\nThe final calculated probability is 0, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is described by the state vector in the *coupled basis*, given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The key quantum numbers are:\n    *   $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$: Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number of 1.\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the system.\n    *   $m=-1$: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most critical piece of information, as it represents a definite value for the system's total z-component angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Final State:** A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state would have a total z-component angular momentum corresponding to a quantum number $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule):** A central principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding angular momenta. The total z-component operator is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    \n    This rule means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be measured to be in an uncoupled configuration of `(m₁, m₂)` if their sum is exactly equal to `m`. Any measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We apply the selection rule to check if the desired outcome is physically possible.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   The selection rule requires that the initial total `m` equals the final total `m₁ + m₂`. Here, **-1 ≠ -2**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. A system known to be in a state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$ cannot be measured to be in a state with a total $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically forbidden. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The Power of the Selection Rule:** The solution hinges entirely on the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. This acts as a definitive filter; if the rule is violated, the probability is immediately zero without the need for more complex calculations involving Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal perspective is to note that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ and the desired final state (with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$) are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator, $L_z$, but correspond to different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, and the probability of a system transitioning to an orthogonal state upon measurement is zero.\n*   **Irrelevance of Total Angular Momentum Quantum Number `l`:** While the value $l=2$ is given and is consistent with the rules for adding two $l=1$ angular momenta ($|1-1| \\le l \\le 1+1$ allows for $l=0, 1, 2$), it is not needed to answer this specific question. The conflict in the magnetic quantum numbers is sufficient to determine the outcome.\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning in Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the key principle ($m = m_1 + m_2$) and correctly concluded that since $-1 \\neq -2$, the probability is 0. The differences in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are merely an artifact of having different option lists provided to them and do not reflect any disagreement about the underlying physics.

A violation of the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ immediately implies the probability is zero, without the need for complex calculations involving Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Orthogonality**: The reasoning can be framed in terms of vector orthogonality.

A step-by-step analysis, which is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all the provided candidate answers, leads to a clear and unambiguous result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The system of two electrons is described in the *coupled basis* by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons (they are in p-orbitals).\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n    *   **m = -1**: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also measured to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: The core physical principle governing this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding angular momenta. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$). This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of (and therefore can only be measured to be in) uncoupled states where the sum of the individual quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to `m`. Any measurement outcome that violates this rule is physically forbidden.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   The selection rule requires that $m = m_1 + m_2$. Comparing the values, we check if $-1 = -2$. This statement is false.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: Since the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it represents a physically impossible event. The probability of a physically impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Conservation Laws are Absolute**: In quantum mechanics, a selection rule derived from a fundamental conservation law (like the conservation of angular momentum) is not an approximation. Its violation implies the probability of the event is exactly zero.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: It is essential to understand that the initial state is given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), which is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum. The measurement projects this state onto the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where the individual components are known. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is the critical bridge between these two descriptions.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: A more formal way to explain this result is that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$) is also an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a *different* eigenvalue, $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system transitioning to a state to which it is orthogonal is zero.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**: The probability is formally given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. By definition, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. This confirms the probability is zero without needing to perform any calculations.\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The values of the total angular momentum quantum numbers ($l_1$, $l_2$, and $l$) are not required to solve this specific question, which can be fully resolved using only the conservation of the z-component ($m$).\n\nThe analysis robustly and unambiguously shows the probability is 0.

The key information from this notation is:\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers.\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the system.\n    *   **m = -1**: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This is the most important piece of information for this problem. It signifies that the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state must, with 100% certainty, yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the joint probability of a specific measurement on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The desired outcome is:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being found in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the second electron being found in a state with an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: The core physical principle governing this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding momenta. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    \n    This rule means that a coupled state with a total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of, or be measured in, uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is exactly equal to `m`. If this rule is not satisfied for a potential outcome, that outcome is physically impossible to measure.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the required total from the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum from the desired final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$).\n    Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically forbidden. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Decisive Rule**: The solution hinges entirely on the selection rule for the magnetic quantum numbers, $m = m_1 + m_2$. The other quantum numbers ($l_1, l_2, l$) are not needed to answer this specific question.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute**: In quantum mechanics, a selection rule derived from a fundamental conservation law is not an approximation. Its violation implies the probability of the event is exactly zero, not just small.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: A more formal way to understand this is to recognize that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state (with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$) is also an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$, but with a *different* eigenvalue of $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring a system in a state to which it is orthogonal is zero.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**: Formally, the probability is the square of the magnitude of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. By definition, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.

This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    \n    This rule states that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of (and therefore can only be measured to be in) uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to `m`.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   The selection rule requires that $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case, this means we must have $-1 = -2$. This statement is false.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the desired measurement outcome is physically forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. The probability of an event that is physically impossible is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Selection Rules as the First Check**: This problem appears to require knowledge of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to decompose the coupled state. However, a simple check of the selection rules ($m=m_1+m_2$) is sufficient to solve the problem immediately. This check should always be the first step in such problems.\n*   **Orthogonality**: A more formal reason for the zero probability is the orthogonality of eigenstates. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, with $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$, is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state in a state orthogonal to it is zero.\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning of Agents**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ as the decisive factor. They all correctly calculate that the initial state has $m=-1$ and the final state requires a total of $m=-2$. They unanimously conclude the probability is 0. The differences in their final lettered choices (A, B, C, D) are due to the options being presented in a different random order for each agent and does not reflect any disagreement on the physics.\n*   **Mapping to Correct Option**: The numerical answer is 0. Based on the options provided in the question prompt (A) 2/3, B) 1/2, C) 1, D) 0), this corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial Quantum State:** The system is in the *coupled basis* state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The essential piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number for the system's z-component of angular momentum, which is **m = -1**. This means the system has a definite, well-defined total z-component angular momentum corresponding to the eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the probability of a joint measurement on the *individual* z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The specific desired outcome is that both measurements yield the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state with individual magnetic quantum numbers:\n    *   Electron 1: **$m_1 = -1$**\n    *   Electron 2: **$m_2 = -1$**\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** A core principle in the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual operators, $L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a strict and absolute **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    \n    This rule states that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be measured to be in an uncoupled state where the sum of the individual magnetic numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to `m`. If this condition is violated, the probability of that outcome is exactly zero.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must apply the selection rule to the values from the problem.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** We compare the initial required total (`m=-1`) with the final measured total (`-2`). Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that is forbidden by a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Selection Rule is Decisive:** The entire problem is solved by the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. No complex calculations involving Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are necessary, because the coefficients themselves are defined to be zero when this rule is violated.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The initial state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum ($L^2$ and $L_z$), while the final measured state is an eigenstate of the individual angular momentum components ($L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$). The selection rule acts as a fundamental constraint when relating these two different descriptions (bases).\n*   **Orthogonality:** A more formal perspective is that the initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue, $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, and the probability of a system transitioning to a state to which it is orthogonal is zero.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The values of $l_1=1, l_2=1$ and $l=2$ are not needed to answer this specific question. The answer hinges solely on the magnetic quantum numbers $m, m_1$, and $m_2$.\n\nGiven that the calculated probability is 0, we select the corresponding option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a standard problem in quantum mechanics concerning the addition of angular momentum.

It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome**: A joint measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the first electron being found in a state with individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.

This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    \n    This rule is absolute. It means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of (and therefore can only be measured to be in) uncoupled states for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to `m`.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the value of `m` from the initial state with the value of `m₁ + m₂` from the desired final state.\n    *   The selection rule requires $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case, this becomes the statement: $-1 = -2$.\n    This statement is false. The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that is forbidden by a conservation law has a probability of exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Power of the Selection Rule**: The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a powerful tool. It allows for an immediate conclusion without the need to calculate any complex Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are used to perform the full basis transformation. The coefficients are zero by definition if this selection rule is violated.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: A more formal way to understand this result is to recognize that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$.

    "This problem requires the application of fundamental principles of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics. A step-by-step analysis, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found across all the candidate answers, provides a clear and unambiguous solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is described by the state vector in the *coupled basis*, given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.

The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule):** A core principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component operator is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a strict and inviolable selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule means that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be measured to be in an uncoupled configuration of `(m₁, m₂)` if their sum is exactly equal to `m`.

For this problem, we check if $-1 = -2$. This statement is **false**. Since the desired measurement outcome violates a fundamental conservation law, it represents a physically impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Power of the Selection Rule:** The solution hinges entirely on the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. This acts as a definitive filter; if the rule is violated, the probability is immediately zero without the need for more complex calculations involving Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal justification is that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ and the desired final state (with $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$) are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator, $L_z$. However, they correspond to different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system transitioning to a state orthogonal to its initial state upon measurement is zero.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** Formally, the probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$. By definition, these coefficients are zero unless the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is met.\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly identified this selection rule, applied it correctly, and concluded the numerical probability is 0. This high level of consensus on the physical reasoning confirms its validity.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The quantum numbers for the magnitude of the angular momenta ($l_1=1, l_2=1, l=2$) are not needed to solve this specific question, which is resolved solely by considering the z-component magnetic quantum numbers.\n\nBased on this definitive analysis, the probability of the specified measurement outcome is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The total z-component operator is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship imposes a strict selection rule on their corresponding quantum numbers. For a measurement to be possible, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers in the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state.\n    **Selection Rule:** `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying this rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be **m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:** We compare the total quantum number required by the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`). Since **-1 ≠ -2**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of this measurement occurring is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The Power of the Selection Rule:** The entire problem is solvable by simply checking the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. The other quantum numbers ($l_1, l_2, l$) are not needed for this specific question.

The desired final state (with $m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1$) is an eigenstate of the same operator but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of one state being measured in a state orthogonal to it is zero.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The probability is formally given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.

The selection rule is a shortcut to knowing the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: An alternative physical explanation is that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state is an eigenstate of the same operator but with a different eigenvalue, $(-1 - 1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal, meaning the probability of transitioning from one to the other is zero.\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The quantum numbers for the magnitude of the angular momenta ($l_1=1, l_2=1, l=2$) are not needed to solve this specific question, which is resolved solely by considering the z-component magnetic quantum numbers.\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning**: All provided candidate answers correctly identify the selection rule as the key, apply it correctly, and conclude the numerical probability is 0. This high level of consensus on the physical reasoning confirms its validity. The disagreement on the final letter in the candidate answers clearly stems from them being provided with different option lists, which is not an error in their reasoning.\n\nBased on the definitive physical reasoning, the joint probability is 0.

The solution to the problem is straightforward when applying a fundamental principle of angular momentum in quantum mechanics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The system of two electrons is described in the *coupled basis* by the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The quantum number for the z-component of the **total** angular momentum is **$m=-1$**. This is the most critical piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the *individual* z-components of angular momentum and obtaining a specific result:\n    *   For the first electron ($L_{1z}$), the eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   For the second electron ($L_{2z}$), the eigenvalue is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This potential final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (Selection Rule)**: The core principle that governs the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n    This rule is absolute. For a measurement outcome to be possible, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers in the final state must equal the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We apply this rule to the given problem:\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the required total $m$ from the initial state ($-1$) with the sum from the desired final state ($-2$). Since **$-1 \\neq -2$**, the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Conservation is Key**: The solution hinges entirely on the conservation law $m = m_1 + m_2$. No complex calculations involving Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are necessary, as the violation of this rule immediately sets the relevant coefficient to zero.\n*   **Eigenstate Orthogonality**: The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system transitioning to a state to which it is orthogonal is zero.\n*   **Consensus Reasoning**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified this exact physical reasoning and unanimously concluded the probability is 0. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are clearly due to them being presented with different option lists, which is a superficial error that doesn't challenge the sound physics conclusion.\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The quantum numbers $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, and $l=2$ are consistent with each other, but they are not needed to solve this specific question. The answer can be found by solely comparing $m$ with the sum of $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\nThe final calculated probability is 0. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) 0\nB) 1/2\nC) 1\nD) 2/3\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a standard problem in the quantum mechanical theory of the addition of angular momentum. A detailed, step-by-step analysis based on the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers leads to an unambiguous conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial Quantum State:**\n    The problem describes the two-electron system in the *coupled basis* with the state ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This notation gives us the following information:\n    *   $l_1=1, l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons. They are in p-orbitals.\n    *   $l=2$: This is the quantum number for the magnitude of the *total* orbital angular momentum of the system.\n    *   **$m=-1$**: This is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most critical piece of information for this problem. It signifies that the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state is guaranteed to yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of a specific outcome when measuring the *individual* z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   A measured eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the first electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   A measured eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the second electron having an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule):**\n    A core principle of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component is the simple sum of the individual component operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This physical relationship imposes a strict and inviolable **selection rule** on their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n    This rule means that a coupled state with a definite total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be measured to be in an uncoupled state with components `m₁` and `m₂` if their sum is exactly equal to `m`. If this condition is not met, the transition is physically forbidden.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must apply the selection rule to see if the desired outcome is physically possible.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is fixed at **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired final measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    The selection rule requires that $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case, this would mean:\n    $-1 = -2$\n    This is a false statement. The desired measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. The probability of an impossible event is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Decisive Factor:** The entire problem is solved by the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, embodied in the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$. This rule acts as a definitive veto; its violation immediately means the probability is zero.\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning:** All candidate answers provided correctly identified this selection rule as the key physical principle and arrived at the correct numerical result of 0. Discrepancies in the final letter choices in the provided examples are due to inconsistent option labeling, not a flaw in the physics.\n*   **No Complex Calculations Needed:** It is unnecessary to calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which formally give the probability amplitude for the transition. By definition, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is zero if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** A more formal perspective is that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, characterized by $m_1=-1, m_2=-1$, is also an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state in another state orthogonal to it is zero.\n\nBased on the unambiguous physical reasoning, the probability of the specified measurement outcome is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from all the candidate answers and highlighting the key physical principles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The system of two electrons is in a *coupled angular momentum state*, described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The essential information to extract from this is:\n    *   $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$: The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n    *   $l=2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.\n    *   **$m=-1$**: The magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the **total** angular momentum. This is the most crucial piece of information. It signifies that the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum for each electron and obtaining the eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to finding the system in a final state with the following individual magnetic quantum numbers:\n    *   For the first electron: **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   For the second electron: **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law (The Selection Rule)**: A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding momenta. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a strict and absolute **selection rule** for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $$m = m_1 + m_2$$\n    This rule means that for a system to transition from an initial state with total magnetic quantum number `m` to a measured final state with individual numbers `m₁` and `m₂`, the sum of the latter must equal the former. Any outcome that violates this rule is physically impossible.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must apply this selection rule to the problem's specifics:\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: We compare the required total `m` from the initial state (`-1`) with the sum from the desired final state (`-2`). Since **$-1 \\neq -2$**, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is physically impossible. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Power of Selection Rules**: The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is the most direct way to solve the problem. It allows for a definitive answer without performing more complex calculations, such as finding Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: Another way to understand this is that the initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state is an eigenstate of the same operator but with a different eigenvalue, $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring a state and finding it to be in a state orthogonal to it is zero.\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The problem illustrates the relationship between the coupled basis ($|l,m\\rangle$), which describes the system as a whole, and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1,m_2\\rangle$), which describes the individual parts. The selection rule is a key constraint linking these two representations.\n*   **Unanimity of Physical Reasoning**: All candidate answers correctly identified the selection rule and its violation, unanimously concluding that the probability is 0. Any differences in their final letter choice arose from being presented with different option lists, not from any disagreement on the physics.\n\nThe calculated probability is 0. Based on the options provided in your question, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Initial State**: The system of two electrons is described by the state vector in the *coupled basis*, given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$: These are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (p-orbitals).\n    *   $l=2$: This is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number for the 2-electron system.\n    *   **$m=-1$**: This is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is the most critical piece of information. It means the system has a definite, well-defined total z-component of angular momentum, and a measurement of this total component will always yield the eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Final State (The Measurement Outcome)**: A measurement is performed on the *individual* z-components of angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired final state is described in the *uncoupled basis*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law**: A core physical principle governs the addition of angular momenta. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    \n    This rule states that a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number `m` can only be a superposition of (and therefore can only be measured to be in) uncoupled states where the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) is equal to `m`.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We now check if the desired measurement outcome is physically possible by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n    *   The selection rule requires that $m = m_1 + m_2$. In our case, this means we must have $-1 = -2$. This statement is false.\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, the desired measurement outcome is physically forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum. The probability of an event that is physically impossible is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Selection Rules as the First Check**: This problem appears to require knowledge of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to decompose the coupled state. However, a simple check of the selection rules ($m=m_1+m_2$) is sufficient to solve the problem immediately. This check should always be the first step in such problems.\n*   **Orthogonality**: A more formal reason for the zero probability is the orthogonality of eigenstates. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, with $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$, is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state in a state orthogonal to it is zero.\n*   **Unanimous Reasoning of Agents**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ as the decisive factor. They all correctly calculate that the initial state has $m=-1$ and the final state requires a total of $m=-2$. They unanimously conclude the probability is 0. The differences in their final lettered choices (A, B, C, D) are due to the options being presented in a different random order for each agent and does not reflect any disagreement on the physics.\n*   **Mapping to Correct Option**: The numerical answer is 0.

The essential piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number for the system's z-component of angular momentum, which is **m = -1**. This means the system has a definite, well-defined total z-component angular momentum corresponding to the eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the probability of a joint measurement on the *individual* z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The specific desired outcome is that both measurements yield the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state with individual magnetic quantum numbers:\n    *   Electron 1: **$m_1 = -1$**\n    *   Electron 2: **$m_2 = -1$**\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** A core principle in the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component.
