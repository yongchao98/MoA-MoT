This compound will be designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This is the most common form of tautomerism for carbonyl compounds. A critical requirement for it to occur is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen.\" Specifically, this is a hydrogen atom located on an **sp³-hybridized** carbon atom that is directly adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is essential for the necessary bond rearrangement.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: The structure of this molecule consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is especially stable because it forms an aromatic ring.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: The structure of this molecule is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms that are adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. This means these alpha-carbons are **sp²-hybridized**. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism** as it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will show** optical isomerism. This compound will be designated as (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The key requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound will show optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different** atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (at position 2). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an overriding element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion), **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. \"Fumarate\" specifies the *trans* geometry across the double bond. This molecule has no chiral center. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis and Decision**\n\n*   We have correctly and unanimously determined from the reasoning that **(A) is benzoquinone**.\n*   We have also correctly and unanimously determined that **(B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThe final step is to match this conclusion with the multiple-choice options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination we derived, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\", corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, integrating the reasoning from the provided solutions.\n\nThe problem asks to identify two specific compounds from given pairs based on their chemical properties.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n**Task**: Identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism from the pair: (i) benzoquinone and (ii) cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This common type of tautomerism involves the migration of a proton and the shifting of a double bond. A crucial prerequisite for a ketone to undergo this transformation is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen.\" Specifically, this is a hydrogen atom located on an **sp³-hybridized carbon atom** that is directly adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is essential for the standard rearrangement mechanism.\n\n*   **Analysis of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Therefore, the hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism. It readily equilibrates with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule's structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms that are adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds. These alpha-carbons are **sp²-hybridized**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Because it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, **benzoquinone does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Decision for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Task**: Identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: (i) methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (ii) dimethyl fumarate. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound will show optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different** atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinctly different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule lacks a chiral center. Furthermore, it is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Decision for (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis and Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the results from both parts:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which does show optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow we match this conclusion to the specific multiple-choice options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe derived pair, {A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}, corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate solutions and fundamental chemical principles.\n\nThe problem asks to identify two compounds based on specific chemical properties. We will analyze each part separately and then combine the findings to select the correct option.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Core Principle**: The relevant form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism, which is an equilibrium between a molecule with a carbonyl group (keto form) and one with a hydroxyl group adjacent to a double bond (enol form).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Requirement for Tautomerism**: A crucial requirement for standard keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen.\" This is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl (C=O) group.

This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Core Principle**: The relevant form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. This is an equilibrium between a molecule containing a ketone group (the keto form) and its isomer containing an alcohol group adjacent to a double bond (the enol form).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Requirement for Tautomerism**: For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, the molecule must possess an \"alpha-hydrogen\". Critically, this hydrogen atom must be attached to an **sp³-hybridized** carbon atom which is adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is essential for the standard bond rearrangement mechanism.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound's structure consists of a six-membered ring where three ketone groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of these methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyls. Therefore, the hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens, fulfilling the requirement for tautomerism. **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This compound has a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. This means they are **sp²-hybridized**. **Conclusion**: Because it lacks the required alpha-hydrogen on an sp³-carbon, benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Decision for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to determine which of the two compounds, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** or **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism.

A chiral molecule is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Indicator of Chirality**: The most common structural feature that causes a molecule to be chiral is the presence of a \"chiral center\". A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to **four different** atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

This molecule has no chiral centers. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Decision for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nSynthesizing the results from both parts:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this definitive conclusion with the provided multiple-choice options.\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Final Matching**: The unanimity in the reasoning of the candidate answers confirms the correct pair of compounds.

This compound is (A).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This common type of tautomerism requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is essential for the typical bond rearrangement.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a ring structure with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The carbon atoms of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule's structure contains C=O groups and C=C double bonds in a ring. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. This means these carbons are sp²-hybridized, not sp³. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify the compound that will exhibit optical isomerism. This compound is (B).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, it is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from the analysis, `A = benzoquinone` and `B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`, corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The sp³ hybridization is essential for the necessary bond rearrangement.\n\n*   **Analysis of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   This molecule's structure contains a six-membered ring where three ketone groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls.

This compound is designated as (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The key requirement for optical isomerism.**\n    A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that causes chirality is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different** atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinctly different groups: (-H), (-OH), (-CH₃), and (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral.

The problem requires a two-part chemical analysis.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: To identify which compound between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does **not** show tautomerism. This compound will be designated as (A).\n\n*   **Core Principle**: The relevant form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism, which is an equilibrium between a molecule containing a ketone (keto form) and one containing an alcohol adjacent to a double bond (enol form).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The prerequisite for tautomerism**: For standard keto-enol tautomerism to occur, the molecule must possess an \"alpha-hydrogen.\" This is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O), where that adjacent carbon is sp³-hybridized. The sp³ hybridization is essential for the necessary rearrangement of bonds.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure is a six-membered ring where three C=O groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is exceptionally stable due to being an aromatic compound.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure contains two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds within a six-membered ring. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds, making them sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: To identify which compound between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate** **will show** optical isomerism. This compound will be designated as (B).\n\n*   **Core Principle**: A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The indicator of chirality**: The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different** atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Because this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where \"fumarate\" specifies the *trans* geometry. This molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it an achiral molecule. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis and Decision**\n\nBy combining the results from both analyses, we have:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Matching the conclusion to the options**: We must now find the multiple-choice option that matches this specific combination. Let's examine the provided list:\n    A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOur derived combination, {A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}, corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Goal**: To identify which compound between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does **not** show tautomerism.

This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.**\n    The most common form of tautomerism for ketones is keto-enol tautomerism. For this equilibrium to occur, a molecule must possess an \"alpha-hydrogen.\" Specifically, this is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is directly adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is essential for the standard rearrangement mechanism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    This molecule's structure contains a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**:\n    This molecule has a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and are therefore sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.**\n    A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that indicates chirality is a \"chiral center\"—a carbon atom bonded to four distinctly different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four unique groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    The structure is the *trans*-isomer, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis and Decision**\n\n*   We have correctly identified that **(A) is benzoquinone**.\n*   We have correctly identified that **(B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this combination to the provided multiple-choice options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from our analysis, {A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}, matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on a synthesis of the provided answers and core chemical principles.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Task**: To identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism. This is compound (A).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Requirement for Keto-Enol Tautomerism.** For the common keto-enol tautomerism to occur, there must be a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen). Critically, this alpha-carbon must be **sp³-hybridized** to allow for the necessary bond rearrangement to form the enol (C=C-OH).\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure contains C=O groups and C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, making them **sp²-hybridized**. Since it lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Task**: To identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism. This is compound (B).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Requirement for Optical Isomerism.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different** atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups: (-H), (-OH), (-CH₃), and (-COOCH₃). Since it possesses a chiral center, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which has a *trans* geometry. It has no chiral center. It is a planar molecule with a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis and Decision**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the options provided in the question:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct pairing of `A = benzoquinone` and `B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information and chemical principles.\n\nThe question asks for two things:\n1.  The compound that **does not** show tautomerism (A) from the pair: benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n2.  The compound that **will show** optical isomerism (B) from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate & dimethyl fumarate.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify the compound that does not exhibit tautomerism. This compound is (A).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This common type of tautomerism requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is essential for the typical bond rearrangement.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a ring structure with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The carbon atoms of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule's structure contains C=O groups and C=C double bonds in a ring. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. This means these carbons are sp²-hybridized, not sp³. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify the compound that will exhibit optical isomerism. This compound is (B).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, it is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from the analysis, `A = benzoquinone` and `B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`, corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
