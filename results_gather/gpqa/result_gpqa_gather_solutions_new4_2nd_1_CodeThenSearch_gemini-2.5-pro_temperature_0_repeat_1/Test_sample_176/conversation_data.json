Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L₂).\n\n### 2. Fundamental Principles\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The intrinsic peak wavelength of emission (λ_emitted) for a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving away (receding), the light is redshifted (λ_observed > λ_emitted). The non-relativistic formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n### 3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### 4. Analyze the Components\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the ratio of the radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step):** This requires careful interpretation. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_observed), not the intrinsic emitted wavelength.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion causes a Doppler shift. Assuming a positive velocity means it is receding, its light is redshifted. Therefore, λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since we are given λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2, we can set the expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). So, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio:\n        T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1\n    *   From the previous step, we can find this ratio:\n        λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the main luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009355\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2292\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation. The answer 2.25 (Option D) is a common distractor that arises from incorrectly assuming the temperatures are the same and ignoring the Doppler effect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\n\n### 2. List the Relevant Physical Principles\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The intrinsic peak emission wavelength (λ_emitted) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). So, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light is shifted if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving away (receding) with velocity *v*, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted): λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n### 3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### 4. Analyze the Components of the Ratio\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    1.  The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_observed). So, λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    2.  For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is equal to its intrinsic emitted wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    3.  For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion causes a redshift, so its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    4.  Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    5.  From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    6.  From the equation in step 4, we can find this ratio: λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    7.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the ratios for the radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) ~2.23\n*   B) ~2.32\n*   C) ~2.25\n*   D) ~2.35\n\nThe result is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation. The error in some candidate answers is to ignore the Doppler effect and assume the temperatures are the same, which would lead to an incorrect answer of 2.25.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The solution involves combining the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler effect.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, the squared ratio of the radii is:\n    **(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25**\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" are the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), not the intrinsic (or rest) peak wavelength (λ_emitted).\n    *   **Wien's Law** (λ_emitted = b/T) relates the intrinsic peak wavelength to the star's temperature.\n    *   **The Doppler Effect** relates the observed wavelength to the intrinsic wavelength. For a source moving away with radial velocity *v*, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is its intrinsic wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted (observed wavelength is longer than emitted): λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2), we can set the expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   Now, we use Wien's Law to substitute temperature (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted):\n        1/T₁ ∝ (1/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   Solving for the temperature ratio T₁/T₂ gives:\n        **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**\n        This shows that Star_1 is slightly cooler than Star_2. For Star_2's light to be redshifted to the same observed wavelength as Star_1, it must have started at a shorter (bluer) wavelength, which corresponds to a higher temperature.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: We substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the given values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    **L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option 2.23.

Analyze the Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step)**\nThis step requires careful interpretation of the given information.\n*   The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_obs). So, λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n*   We must relate this observed wavelength to the intrinsic temperature using Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n*   From Wien's Law, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n*   Now, we use the Doppler effect to relate the observed and emitted wavelengths:\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0. There is no Doppler shift, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. Assuming a positive velocity means it is moving away, its light is redshifted. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   From this, we find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n    λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n**6. Combine and Calculate the Final Answer**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n**7.

This gives the primary formula for the ratio: L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength is shifted from the *intrinsic* wavelength due to the star's radial velocity.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** We are given R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the radius term (R₁/R₂)² is (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the critical part of the problem. The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2).\n        *   Star 1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed wavelength is its true, emitted wavelength (λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1).\n        *   Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its light is Doppler-shifted. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we have: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   From Wien's Law, T is proportional to 1/λ_emitted. Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n        *   From the Doppler relation, we find λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). So, T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   **Final Calculation:** We substitute these terms back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Agent Answers:**\n    *   **Correct Approach:** The majority of agents (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17) correctly identify the need to use the Doppler effect and derive a result of approximately 2.229. This value is closest to option C (~2.23).\n    *   **Incorrect Approach:** A few agents (e.g., 9, 11, 15) make a critical error by ignoring the Doppler effect. They assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This leads them to an incorrect answer of 2.25 (Option A). This approach disregards the crucial information about the radial velocities.\n    *   **Inconsistencies:** Many agents that correctly calculate the value of ~2.229 then select the wrong letter for their final answer (e.g., Answer 2 calculates ~2.23 but chooses B, which is ~2.32). However, the reasoning and calculation steps are the most important part of the evaluation.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The most robust and physically sound reasoning, supported by the majority of the agents' calculations, leads to a value of approximately 2.229. This corresponds to option C. The agents who chose other answers either made a fundamental physics error or were inconsistent in matching their result to the given options.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of ~2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Foundational Principles\nThe problem requires combining three key principles of astrophysics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The total luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on its radius, R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The intrinsic peak wavelength of emission (λ_emitted) for a black body is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). `T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`.\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving away (receding), the light is redshifted (wavelength increases). The non-relativistic formula is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)`\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Ratios\n\n*   **Radius Ratio**: The problem states `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`. Therefore, the ratio `(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`. This part is straightforward and agreed upon by almost all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (The Crucial Step)**: This is where the main point of contention lies.\n    *   The problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars **appeared brightest**... are the same.\" This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (`λ_observed`), not the intrinsic emitted wavelength.\n    *   **Star 1**: Has a radial velocity `v₁ = 0`. There is no Doppler shift. Therefore, `λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1`.\n    *   **Star 2**: Has a radial velocity `v₂ = 700 km/s`. Since it's moving, its light is Doppler shifted. A positive velocity implies it is receding, so its light is redshifted. `λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2`, we can equate the expressions: `λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n    *   From Wien's Law, `T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`, which means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1`.\n    *   From the equation above, we find this ratio: `λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n\n### 4. Common Pitfall\nSeveral candidate answers (e.g., 9, 11, 15) make the mistake of assuming that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This ignores the Doppler effect on Star 2. If the temperatures were the same, the luminosity ratio would simply be `(1.5)² = 2.25`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect because it disregards the provided velocity information.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe must use the correctly derived temperature ratio.\n`L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (T₁/T₂)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴`\n\nNow, plug in the values (`v₂ = 700 km/s`, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`):\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated factor is approximately 2.229. This value is closest to the option **~2.23**. The majority of the candidate answers that correctly account for the Doppler effect arrive at this same numerical conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\n\n### 2. Identify the Core Physical Principles\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on the radius, R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The intrinsic peak wavelength of a star's emission (λ_emitted) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). So, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light from a moving object is shifted relative to its emitted wavelength. For an object moving away (receding), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). The non-relativistic formula is λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### 4. Analyze the Ratios from the Given Information\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂)**: The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂)**: This is the most critical part of the calculation.\n    1.  The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_observed). So, λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2.\n    2.  We must relate this observed wavelength to the intrinsic emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) using the Doppler effect to find the true temperature.\n    3.  For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    4.  For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This causes a redshift, so its observed wavelength is λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    5.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    6.  From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    7.  From the relationship in step 5, we find this ratio: λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    8.  So, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s, c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009355\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.2292**\n\n### 6.

This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_obs).\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted) relates temperature to the **emitted** (or rest) peak wavelength.\n    *   The Doppler effect connects the observed and emitted wavelengths: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n4.  **Applying the Doppler Effect:**\n    *   For Star 1, v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star 2, v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted, so λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the problem states λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can conclude:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    *   Using the relationship from the Doppler effect:\n        T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    *   Plug in the values (v₂ = 700 km/s, c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n        L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Answers\n\n*   **Correct Approach:** The majority of the candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17) correctly identify the need to account for the Doppler effect. They all arrive at a numerical result of approximately 2.229.\n*   **Incorrect Approach:** A few answers (9, 11, 15) incorrectly assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This ignores the non-zero velocity of Star 2 and leads to an incorrect answer of 2.25. This corresponds to option D.\n*   **Conclusion:** The physically correct approach, confirmed by the majority of the detailed analyses, yields a result of ~2.229.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) ~2.23\n*   B) ~2.35\n*   C) ~2.32\n*   D) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a careful application of several principles of astrophysics: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for luminosity, Wien's Displacement Law for temperature, and the Doppler effect for observed wavelengths.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the correct logical steps, which is supported by the majority of the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. The Goal: Luminosity Ratio**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂). The Stefan-Boltzmann law gives the luminosity of a star as L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio is therefore:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nAfter canceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n**2. The Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\nTherefore, the squared ratio of the radii is:\n**(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25**\n\n**3. The Temperature Ratio (The Crucial Step)**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem. The temperature ratio must be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's intrinsic (or rest-frame) peak emission wavelength (λ_emitted) to its surface temperature (T). The relationship is T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: **T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1**.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. \"Appeared\" refers to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: **λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1**.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion away from the observer causes a redshift, stretching the light to a longer wavelength. The relationship is: **λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)**, where c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Combining the Information:** Since the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2), we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n*   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We can now find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n    Since T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1, we have:\n    **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the main luminosity equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nPlugging in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00936\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option **2.23**. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation. The reasoning that ignores the Doppler effect and arrives at 2.25 is incorrect because it misinterprets the meaning of \"appeared brightest.\"\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

There is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. Since it's moving, its light is Doppler-shifted. A positive velocity implies it is moving away, causing a redshift. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n*   Now, we can relate the emitted wavelengths.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown that synthesizes the correct approaches and identifies the crucial points of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio from Stefan-Boltzmann Law**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant.\n\n    The ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, the squared ratio of the radii is:\n    **(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25**\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio (The Most Careful Point)**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem. The temperature ratio must be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n\n    *   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* or *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted). So, T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    *   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" are the same. This refers to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is what an astronomer on Earth would measure. This observed wavelength is affected by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** For Star 2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted (assuming it's moving away). The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the formula: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n    Let's apply this to both stars:\n    *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0 km/s): There is no Doppler shift. So, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): There is a Doppler shift. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n    Since the problem states λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**\n\n    *Note*: Several candidate answers incorrectly assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This ignores the crucial information about Star 2's velocity and the resulting Doppler effect.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009355...\n    **L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated factor is approximately 2.229, which is closest to option A, 2.23.

The luminosity ratio was defined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law as L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n2.  The radius ratio squared, (R₁/R₂)², was calculated as 1.5² = 2.25.\n3.  The temperature ratio, T₁/T₂, was determined by accounting for the Doppler effect. Since the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical, but Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. This means its *emitted* wavelength must be shorter (and its temperature higher) than Star_1's. The code correctly calculated this temperature ratio to be approximately 0.99767.\n4.  Substituting these values into the luminosity formula, the final ratio was computed to be 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 2.2291.\n\nThis calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo decide the final answer, a careful step-by-step analysis of the physics involved is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂), i.e., L₁ / L₂.\n\n2.  **Fundamental Principles**:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The intrinsic peak wavelength of emission (λ_emitted) for a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emitted = b/T, where b is a constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving away (receding) at a non-relativistic speed v, the formula is λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n3.  **Deriving the Luminosity Ratio**:\n    From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n2.  **Temperature Ratio**: This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same.

This mistake stems from misinterpreting \"appeared brightest\" as the intrinsic property rather than the observed one.\n\nThe most careful and physically correct approach yields a result of ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here are the critical points to consider in reaching the correct solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Formula**: The fundamental relationship governing the luminosity (L) of a star treated as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is therefore L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Component**: The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Thus, the radius component of the ratio is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. This part of the calculation is straightforward and agreed upon by almost all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Wavelength Information Correctly**: This is the most crucial step. The problem states \"the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest*... are the same.\" The term \"appeared\" refers to the light as it is *observed* by the astronomers, not the intrinsic wavelength emitted by the star. Therefore, the Doppler effect due to the stars' motion must be considered.\n\n4.  **Apply the Doppler Effect**:\n    *   Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is identical to its emitted (rest) peak wavelength (λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1).\n    *   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Assuming this is a receding velocity (standard convention), its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength according to the formula: λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2), we can establish a relationship between the emitted wavelengths: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Relate Wavelength to Temperature**: Wien's Displacement Law states that a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *emitted* peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n\n6.  **Determine the Temperature Component**: Using the relationship from step 4, we find the temperature ratio: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). This shows that Star_1 is slightly cooler than Star_2.\n\n7.  **Avoid the Common Pitfall**: Several candidate answers (9, 11, 15) incorrectly assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This leads to a temperature ratio of 1 and a final answer of 2.25. This is a classic distractor in physics problems; it represents a simplified calculation that ignores a key piece of information (the radial velocity and its effect on observed wavelength).\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the correct radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 2.229 is closest to the option 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "To determine the final answer, it is essential to perform a step-by-step analysis of the physics involved and identify the critical points where mistakes could be made.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Governing Equation**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is therefore:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    After canceling the constants, we get:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n2.  **The Radius Ratio**: The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. This is a straightforward substitution:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **The Temperature Ratio**: This is the most critical part of the problem and requires careful interpretation.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength.** The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest... are the same.\" The word \"appeared\" is key, as it refers to the wavelength *observed* by the astronomers, not the intrinsic wavelength *emitted* by the star. Therefore, λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Doppler Effect.** The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity.\n        *   For Star 1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n        *   For Star 2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion away from the observer causes its light to be redshifted (stretched to a longer wavelength). The relationship is: λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c), where c is the speed of light.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Relating Wavelength to Temperature.** Wien's Displacement Law states that a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *emitted* peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). This means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: **T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1**.\n    *   **Deriving the Temperature Ratio.** Since λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2, we can set the expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n        Rearranging this to find the ratio we need for the temperature gives:\n        λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n        Therefore, the temperature ratio is: **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **The Common Pitfall**: A frequent mistake is to ignore the Doppler effect. If one assumes that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂), the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂)⁴ becomes 1. This leads to an incorrect final answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25, which corresponds to option B. This approach fails to use all the information given in the problem (specifically, the radial velocities).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We substitute the correct radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the given values (v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009355\n    **L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers that correctly apply the Doppler effect arrive at this same numerical result, confirming its validity. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to inconsistent mapping of the result to the options, not errors in the physical reasoning.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The solution involves combining the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler effect.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Identify the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂), which is L₁ / L₂.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The intrinsic peak wavelength of emission (λ_emitted) for a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to its emitted wavelength. For a source moving away with radial velocity v, the observed wavelength is redshifted: λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**4.

Analyze the Temperature Ratio**\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the light as it is observed.\n*   We must relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. This causes a redshift. Thus, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n*   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n**6.

The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Analysis of the Problem and Agent Responses\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n2.  **Core Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** Luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature (L ∝ R²T⁴). This gives the primary formula for the ratio: L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted).\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength is shifted from the *intrinsic* wavelength due to the star's radial velocity.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** We are given R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the radius term (R₁/R₂)² is (1.5)² = 2.25.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the critical part of the problem. The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2).\n        *   Star 1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed wavelength is its true, emitted wavelength (λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1).\n        *   Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its light is Doppler-shifted. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we have: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n        *   From Wien's Law, T is proportional to 1/λ_emitted. Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n        *   From the Doppler relation, we find λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). So, T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   **Final Calculation:** We substitute these terms back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Agent Answers:**\n    *   **Correct Approach:** The majority of agents (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17) correctly identify the need to use the Doppler effect and derive a result of approximately 2.229. This value is closest to option C (~2.23).\n    *   **Incorrect Approach:** A few agents (e.g., 9, 11, 15) make a critical error by ignoring the Doppler effect. They assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This leads them to an incorrect answer of 2.25 (Option A). This approach disregards the crucial information about the radial velocities.\n    *   **Inconsistencies:** Many agents that correctly calculate the value of ~2.229 then select the wrong letter for their final answer (e.g., Answer 2 calculates ~2.23 but chooses B, which is ~2.32). However, the reasoning and calculation steps are the most important part of the evaluation.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The most robust and physically sound reasoning, supported by the majority of the agents' calculations, leads to a value of approximately 2.229. This corresponds to option C. The agents who chose other answers either made a fundamental physics error or were inconsistent in matching their result to the given options.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of ~2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Foundational Principles\nThe problem requires combining three key principles of astrophysics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The total luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on its radius, R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is `L = 4πR²σT⁴`.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The intrinsic peak wavelength of emission (λ_emitted) for a black body is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). `T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`.\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving away (receding), the light is redshifted (wavelength increases). The non-relativistic formula is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)`.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)`\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n`L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Ratios\n\n*   **Radius Ratio**: The problem states `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`. Therefore, the ratio `(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25`. This part is straightforward and agreed upon by almost all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (The Crucial Step)**: This is where the main point of contention lies.\n    *   The problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars **appeared brightest**... are the same.\" This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (`λ_observed`), not the intrinsic emitted wavelength.\n    *   **Star 1**: Has a radial velocity `v₁ = 0`. There is no Doppler shift. Therefore, `λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1`.\n    *   **Star 2**: Has a radial velocity `v₂ = 700 km/s`. Since it's moving, its light is Doppler shifted. A positive velocity implies it is receding, so its light is redshifted. `λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2`, we can equate the expressions: `λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n    *   From Wien's Law, `T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`, which means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: `T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1`.\n    *   From the equation above, we find this ratio: `λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n\n### 4. Common Pitfall\nSeveral candidate answers (e.g., 9, 11, 15) make the mistake of assuming that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This ignores the Doppler effect on Star 2. If the temperatures were the same, the luminosity ratio would simply be `(1.5)² = 2.25`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect because it disregards the provided velocity information.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe must use the correctly derived temperature ratio.\n`L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (T₁/T₂)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴`\n\nNow, plug in the values (`v₂ = 700 km/s`, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`):\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936`\n`L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated factor is approximately 2.229. This value is closest to the option **~2.23**. The majority of the candidate answers that correctly account for the Doppler effect arrive at this same numerical conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\n\n### 2. Identify the Core Physical Principles\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area (which depends on the radius, R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The intrinsic peak wavelength of a star's emission (λ_emitted) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). So, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light from a moving object is shifted relative to its emitted wavelength. For an object moving away (receding), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). The non-relativistic formula is λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### 4. Analyze the Ratios from the Given Information\n\n*   **Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂)**: The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂)**: This is the most critical part of the calculation.\n    1.  The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_observed). So, λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2.\n    2.  We must relate this observed wavelength to the intrinsic emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) using the Doppler effect to find the true temperature.\n    3.  For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    4.  For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This causes a redshift, so its observed wavelength is λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    5.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    6.  From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    7.  From the relationship in step 5, we find this ratio: λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    8.  So, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s, c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009355\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.2292**\n\n### 6.

This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_obs).\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted) relates temperature to the **emitted** (or rest) peak wavelength.\n    *   The Doppler effect connects the observed and emitted wavelengths: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n4.  **Applying the Doppler Effect:**\n    *   For Star 1, v₁ = 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star 2, v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted, so λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the problem states λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can conclude:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    *   Using the relationship from the Doppler effect:\n        T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    *   Plug in the values (v₂ = 700 km/s, c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n        L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Answers\n\n*   **Correct Approach:** The majority of the candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17) correctly identify the need to account for the Doppler effect. They all arrive at a numerical result of approximately 2.229.\n*   **Incorrect Approach:** A few answers (9, 11, 15) incorrectly assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This ignores the non-zero velocity of Star 2 and leads to an incorrect answer of 2.25. This corresponds to option D.\n*   **Conclusion:** The physically correct approach, confirmed by the majority of the detailed analyses, yields a result of ~2.229.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) ~2.23\n*   B) ~2.35\n*   C) ~2.32\n*   D) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a careful application of several principles of astrophysics: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for luminosity, Wien's Displacement Law for temperature, and the Doppler effect for observed wavelengths.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the correct logical steps, which is supported by the majority of the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. The Goal: Luminosity Ratio**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂). The Stefan-Boltzmann law gives the luminosity of a star as L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio is therefore:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nAfter canceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n**2. The Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\nTherefore, the squared ratio of the radii is:\n**(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25**\n\n**3. The Temperature Ratio (The Crucial Step)**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem. The temperature ratio must be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's intrinsic (or rest-frame) peak emission wavelength (λ_emitted) to its surface temperature (T). The relationship is T ∝ 1/λ_emitted. This means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: **T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1**.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. \"Appeared\" refers to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: **λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1**.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This motion away from the observer causes a redshift, stretching the light to a longer wavelength. The relationship is: **λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)**, where c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Combining the Information:** Since the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2), we can set the expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n*   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We can now find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n    Since T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1, we have:\n    **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the main luminosity equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nPlugging in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00936\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option **2.23**. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation. The reasoning that ignores the Doppler effect and arrives at 2.25 is incorrect because it misinterprets the meaning of \"appeared brightest.\"\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Identify the Relevant Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The intrinsic peak emission wavelength (λ_emitted) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T), i.e., T ∝ 1/λ_emitted.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) due to the source's radial velocity (v). For non-relativistic speeds, λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**4. Analyze the Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\nTherefore, the squared ratio of the radii is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n**5. Analyze the Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem. The key is to understand the difference between *observed* and *emitted* wavelength.\n*   The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n*   Wien's Law relates temperature to the **emitted** (or intrinsic) peak wavelength: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n*   We must use the Doppler effect to connect the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity v₁ = 0. There is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. Since it's moving, its light is Doppler-shifted. A positive velocity implies it is moving away, causing a redshift. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n*   Now, we can relate the emitted wavelengths. Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2:\n    λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n*   From this, we find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation:\n    λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n**6. Combine and Calculate the Final Answer**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values (using c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009355...\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2292\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n*   A) ~2.35\n*   B) ~2.25 (This would be the answer if the Doppler effect were ignored)\n*   C) ~2.23\n*   D) ~2.32\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, the most accurate solution is derived by correctly applying the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler effect. Here is a step-by-step breakdown that synthesizes the correct approaches and identifies the crucial points of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio from Stefan-Boltzmann Law**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant.\n\n    The ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n    Therefore, the squared ratio of the radii is:\n    **(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25**\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio (The Most Careful Point)**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem. The temperature ratio must be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n\n    *   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* or *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted). So, T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    *   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" are the same. This refers to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs), which is what an astronomer on Earth would measure. This observed wavelength is affected by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** For Star 2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted (assuming it's moving away). The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the formula: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n    Let's apply this to both stars:\n    *   For Star 1 (v₁ = 0 km/s): There is no Doppler shift. So, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n    *   For Star 2 (v₂ = 700 km/s): There is a Doppler shift. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n    Since the problem states λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**\n\n    *Note*: Several candidate answers incorrectly assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This ignores the crucial information about Star 2's velocity and the resulting Doppler effect.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009355...\n    **L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated factor is approximately 2.229, which is closest to option A, 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe python code successfully executed the plan to determine the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.\n\nThe calculation proceeded as follows:\n1.  The luminosity ratio was defined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law as L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n2.  The radius ratio squared, (R₁/R₂)², was calculated as 1.5² = 2.25.\n3.  The temperature ratio, T₁/T₂, was determined by accounting for the Doppler effect. Since the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical, but Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. This means its *emitted* wavelength must be shorter (and its temperature higher) than Star_1's. The code correctly calculated this temperature ratio to be approximately 0.99767.\n4.  Substituting these values into the luminosity formula, the final ratio was computed to be 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 2.2291.\n\nThis calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo decide the final answer, a careful step-by-step analysis of the physics involved is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂), i.e., L₁ / L₂.\n\n2.  **Fundamental Principles**:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is a constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The intrinsic peak wavelength of emission (λ_emitted) for a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emitted = b/T, where b is a constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of light is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength if the source is moving relative to the observer. For a source moving away (receding) at a non-relativistic speed v, the formula is λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).\n\n3.  **Deriving the Luminosity Ratio**:\n    From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    **L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii squared is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n2.  **Temperature Ratio**: This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    *   The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength (λ_observed).\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* peak wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the given observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths.\n        *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is v₁ = 0. There is no Doppler shift, so λ_observed,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n        *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s. This causes a redshift, so λ_observed,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since we are given λ_observed,1 = λ_observed,2, we can set the expressions equal:\n        λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n        λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values (v₂ = 700 km/s, c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009355\n    **L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to the option **2.23**.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\n*   The majority of the candidate answers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 13, 16, 17) correctly follow this logic, accounting for the Doppler shift, and arrive at ~2.23.\n*   A minority of answers (e.g., 9, 11, 15) make the error of assuming the *emitted* wavelengths are the same, thus ignoring the provided radial velocity information and incorrectly calculating the answer as 2.25. This mistake stems from misinterpreting \"appeared brightest\" as the intrinsic property rather than the observed one.\n\nThe most careful and physically correct approach yields a result of ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here are the critical points to consider in reaching the correct solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Formula**: The fundamental relationship governing the luminosity (L) of a star treated as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is therefore L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Component**: The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Thus, the radius component of the ratio is (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25. This part of the calculation is straightforward and agreed upon by almost all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Wavelength Information Correctly**: This is the most crucial step. The problem states \"the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest*... are the same.\" The term \"appeared\" refers to the light as it is *observed* by the astronomers, not the intrinsic wavelength emitted by the star. Therefore, the Doppler effect due to the stars' motion must be considered.\n\n4.  **Apply the Doppler Effect**:\n    *   Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is identical to its emitted (rest) peak wavelength (λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1).\n    *   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Assuming this is a receding velocity (standard convention), its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength according to the formula: λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2), we can establish a relationship between the emitted wavelengths: λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n5.  **Relate Wavelength to Temperature**: Wien's Displacement Law states that a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *emitted* peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,2 / λ_emitted,1.\n\n6.  **Determine the Temperature Component**: Using the relationship from step 4, we find the temperature ratio: T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). This shows that Star_1 is slightly cooler than Star_2.\n\n7.  **Avoid the Common Pitfall**: Several candidate answers (9, 11, 15) incorrectly assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. This leads to a temperature ratio of 1 and a final answer of 2.25. This is a classic distractor in physics problems; it represents a simplified calculation that ignores a key piece of information (the radial velocity and its effect on observed wavelength).\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the correct radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 2.229 is closest to the option 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
