Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the spectrum for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThis data provides a unique fingerprint to identify the two components.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe key to this problem is accurately predicting the spectrum for each of the four candidate molecules based on their symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has two ethyl groups. The protons on these groups will couple with each other, producing a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem explicitly states that all signals in the aliphatic region are *singlets*. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately **eliminated**. This rules out option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in this symmetrical AA' system, they appear as a single sharp signal. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at H4 and H6 equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we must find which 1:1 mixture of the remaining three compounds matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene provides one 12H singlet. Prehnitene provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined mixture would have at least four signals (6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H, possibly with overlap), which does not match the observation of three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined mixture would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the experimental data, which shows only three. While one could argue for an accidental overlap of signals, Option A fits the data directly without requiring such an assumption.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only pair of compounds that produces the described spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets is a crucial piece of information.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (e.g., singlet), and their relative integrations.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This results in **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This results in **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This results in **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent), the one at C2, and the one at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H** (or 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They form an AA' spin system which typically appears as a single sharp signal, i.e., **one singlet**, with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- signal will be a quartet, and the -CH3- signal will be a triplet. This contradicts the experimental data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nSince 1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated, **Option A** (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene) is incorrect.\n\nNow let's analyze the remaining options based on the number of signals they would produce in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data (two signals).\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two signals from different compounds would appear as **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio would be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic region data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the aliphatic region data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the spectrum for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe key takeaways are:\n1.  The presence of only singlets in the aliphatic region strongly suggests the signals are from methyl groups and not ethyl groups (which would show a quartet and a triplet). This immediately eliminates **1,4-diethylbenzene**.\n2.  The presence of two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 mixture implies that the combination of the two compounds results in exactly two distinct aromatic proton environments, with an equal number of protons in each.\n3.  The presence of three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio means the combination of methyl groups from both compounds results in exactly three distinct methyl proton environments with that specific integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Prediction:** **One singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent.\n        *   **Prediction:** **One singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They are adjacent, but in such symmetrical systems (AA'), they often appear as a single sharp peak.\n        *   **Prediction:** **One singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3).\n        *   **Prediction:** **Two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. H4 is between a methyl and a hydrogen, while H6 is between two methyls.\n        *   **Prediction:** **Two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair (C1, C3), the unique C2 methyl, and the unique C5 methyl.\n        *   **Prediction:** **Three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H** (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   As established in Step 1, this compound is eliminated because its ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces **two** aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and **three** aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated because of 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two distinct singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet** for **12H**. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets**, each for **6H**. The combined spectrum of the mixture will therefore show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the exact NMR spectrum described is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1.

This gives **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no symmetry that makes major groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This gives **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in different environments. Accounting for common accidental equivalence, this typically results in **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H integration ratio (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. In introductory problems, this AA' system is treated as a **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This gives **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- protons appear as a **quartet**, and the -CH3- protons appear as a **triplet**. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, this compound can be **eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each) = **Three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (2 singlets, 1H each) = **Three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two signals from different molecules will appear as **two singlets**. Since each represents 2H, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene gives one singlet for 12H. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum for the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the aliphatic data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe key takeaways are:\n1.  The presence of only singlets in the aliphatic region strongly suggests the signals are from methyl groups and not ethyl groups (which would show a quartet and a triplet).\n2.  The total number of distinct proton environments in the mixture is 2 (aromatic) + 3 (aliphatic) = 5.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent and have no adjacent protons.

This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic signal, 2 aliphatic signals.*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This gives **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n    *   *Summary: 2 aromatic signals, 3 aliphatic signals.*\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin coupling.

The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, the integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.

Deconstruct the Problem and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Goal:** Identify the two compounds in a 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region Data:** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region Data:** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThis step is crucial and requires careful consideration of molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet and the -CH3- protons will be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated** because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are equivalent. A common point of confusion is their multiplicity. Because they are adjacent and equivalent (an AA' system), they can appear as a complex multiplet. However, in many contexts, especially for introductory problems, this is simplified to **one singlet (2H)** because the coupling constant is small or the chemical shift difference is zero. We will proceed with this common simplification.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4, C6) are in different chemical environments. H4 is between a methyl and a proton, while H6 is between two methyl groups. They have no adjacent protons to couple with. This gives **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the equivalent pair (C1, C3), the unique C2, and the unique C5. This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find the 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration of 2H each, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option A. The analysis shows that this combination uniquely accounts for both the aromatic (two 2H singlets) and aliphatic (one 12H singlet, two 6H singlets) regions of the spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThis data provides strict constraints. The \"all singlets\" observation is particularly important.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet due to proton-proton coupling.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture**. This immediately eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. In this specific symmetric system, they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. H4 is between a methyl and a hydrogen, while H6 is between two methyls. This gives **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to assume the two aromatic protons in Isodurene are equivalent. They are not, which is key to solving the problem.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aromatic signals: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   Aromatic signals: Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these will appear as **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene gives **one singlet** for 12H. Prehnitene gives **two singlets**, each for 6H. The total spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This combination accounts for the number, multiplicity, and integration ratios of all signals without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **1.

Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo solve this, we must first predict the spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to proton-proton coupling. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**, which also eliminates option **D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This results in **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This results in **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C3, the unique methyl at C2, and the unique methyl at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we must find which 1:1 mixture of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers matches the experimental data.\n\n**Aromatic Region Check:**\nEach of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers produces a single aromatic singlet for 2H. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will produce **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which simplifies to a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data, so the aromatic region does not distinguish between options A, B, and C.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Check (The Deciding Factor):**\nThe mixture's spectrum shows **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Let's examine the combinations:\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The total number of signals would be at least four (assuming one 6H signal overlaps), which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The total number of signals would be four, which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   The combination of these signals results in exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data for the aliphatic region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **1.

Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the mixtures, we must first understand the spectrum of each component. This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** This compound has ethyl groups, which produce a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-) due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. In many contexts, this AA' system appears as a single sharp signal. We will treat it as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This gives **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different chemical environments. This would give **four separate singlets (3H each)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test the remaining combinations against the experimental data (2 aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio; 3 aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene provides one 12H singlet. Prehnitene provides two 6H singlets. The mixture therefore shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit for all observations.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only mixture that produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the careful points and synthesizing the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand what the experimental data tells us about the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" means there are two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these aromatic protons have no adjacent proton neighbors to cause splitting.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\": Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Three signals\" means there are three chemically distinct types of alkyl protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" strongly suggests the signals are from methyl (-CH3) groups attached to the benzene ring (or another quaternary carbon), as ethyl groups would produce quartets and triplets.\n    *   \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons for these three signals.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has two ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet and the -CH3 protons would be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture**. This immediately eliminates option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: While technically an AA' system, in introductory problems and often in practice, this appears as a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments (H4 is between two methyls, H6 is next to one). They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at (C1, C3), the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H** (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining options in a 1:1 ratio and compare to the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 2.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data (two signals).\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two signals from different compounds will appear as **two singlets**. Since each represents 2H, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This perfectly matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This perfectly matches the aliphatic data.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the problem, the correct answer can be determined by systematically predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for each compound and then for each possible mixture.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Individual Compounds**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound would show a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to the ethyl groups. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound is eliminated, and **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has:\n    *   One type of aromatic proton -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   One type of methyl group -> **1 aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Due to a plane of symmetry, it has:\n    *   One type of aromatic proton -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Two types of methyl groups -> **2 aliphatic singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** Due to a plane of symmetry, it has:\n    *   One type of aromatic proton -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Three types of methyl groups -> **3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Aromatic Region Check:**\nA 1:1 mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two aromatic singlets, each corresponding to 2H. This results in a 1:1 ratio. This information does not distinguish between options A, B, and D.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Check (The Deciding Factor):**\nWe need a combination that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n    *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total: At least four distinct signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Total: Exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total: Four distinct signals. This is incorrect.\n\nOnly the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is consistent with all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the spectrum for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information. It implies that the protons giving rise to these signals have no chemically non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbon atoms.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the molecular symmetry of each candidate to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H. (Note: While adjacent equivalent protons can sometimes form complex multiplets, in introductory problems and many real-world cases for such symmetric molecules, they appear as a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is next to only one methyl group. This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in three or four distinct chemical environments, which would lead to at least **three aliphatic singlets**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- signal will be a **quartet**, and the -CH3- signal will be a **triplet**. This directly contradicts the experimental data that all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can immediately eliminate any option containing **1,4-diethylbenzene**.\n*   This eliminates option B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nNow, let's test the remaining combinations for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.

Although they are adjacent, symmetrically equivalent protons in an AA' system like this typically appear as a single sharp signal. This results in **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the spectrum for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The key features are:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. This implies the absence of adjacent, non-equivalent protons, which is a strong filter for the possible structures.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) would show spin-spin coupling.

They have no adjacent protons, resulting in **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, resulting in **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. In such a symmetrical system (AA'), they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is adjacent to only one. Neither has an adjacent proton. This results in **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3, the unique methyl at C2, and the unique methyl at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H** (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces **two** aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and **three** aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 2.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two distinct singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet** for **12H**. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets**, each for **6H**. The combined spectrum will therefore show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the exact NMR spectrum described is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The protons on these groups will couple with each other, producing a **quartet** (for the -CH2-) and a **triplet** (for the -CH3-).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem explicitly states that all signals in the aliphatic region are *singlets*. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately **eliminated**. This rules out option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in this symmetrical AA' system, they appear as a single sharp signal. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the protons at H4 and H6 equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we must find which 1:1 mixture of the remaining three compounds matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene provides one 12H singlet. Prehnitene provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined mixture would have at least four signals (6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H, possibly with overlap), which does not match the observation of three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined mixture would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the experimental data, which shows only three. While one could argue for an accidental overlap of signals, Option A fits the data directly without requiring such an assumption.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only pair of compounds that produces the described spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets is a crucial piece of information.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (e.g., singlet), and their relative integrations.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This results in **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This results in **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This results in **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent), the one at C2, and the one at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H** (or 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They form an AA' spin system which typically appears as a single sharp signal, i.e., **one singlet**, with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- signal will be a quartet, and the -CH3- signal will be a triplet. This contradicts the experimental data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nSince 1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated, **Option A** (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene) is incorrect.\n\nNow let's analyze the remaining options based on the number of signals they would produce in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data (two signals).\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two signals from different compounds would appear as **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio would be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic region data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the aliphatic region data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the spectrum for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe key takeaways are:\n1.  The presence of only singlets in the aliphatic region strongly suggests the signals are from methyl groups and not ethyl groups (which would show a quartet and a triplet). This immediately eliminates **1,4-diethylbenzene**.\n2.  The presence of two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 mixture implies that the combination of the two compounds results in exactly two distinct aromatic proton environments, with an equal number of protons in each.\n3.  The presence of three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio means the combination of methyl groups from both compounds results in exactly three distinct methyl proton environments with that specific integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent.

They are adjacent, but in such symmetrical systems (AA'), they often appear as a single sharp peak.\n        *   **Prediction:** **One singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3).\n        *   **Prediction:** **Two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments.

In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two distinct singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet** for **12H**. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets**, each for **6H**. The combined spectrum of the mixture will therefore show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.

Accounting for common accidental equivalence, this typically results in **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H integration ratio (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent.

A common point of confusion is their multiplicity. Because they are adjacent and equivalent (an AA' system), they can appear as a complex multiplet. However, in many contexts, especially for introductory problems, this is simplified to **one singlet (2H)** because the coupling constant is small or the chemical shift difference is zero. We will proceed with this common simplification.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4, C6) are in different chemical environments. H4 is between a methyl and a proton, while H6 is between two methyl groups. They have no adjacent protons to couple with. This gives **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the equivalent pair (C1, C3), the unique C2, and the unique C5.

This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option A. The analysis shows that this combination uniquely accounts for both the aromatic (two 2H singlets) and aliphatic (one 12H singlet, two 6H singlets) regions of the spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThis data provides strict constraints.

Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture**. This immediately eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons.

In this specific symmetric system, they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. H4 is between a methyl and a hydrogen, while H6 is between two methyls. This gives **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to assume the two aromatic protons in Isodurene are equivalent.

This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene gives **one singlet** for 12H. Prehnitene gives **two singlets**, each for 6H. The total spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will produce **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which simplifies to a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data, so the aromatic region does not distinguish between options A, B, and C.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Check (The Deciding Factor):**\nThe mixture's spectrum shows **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Let's examine the combinations:\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The total number of signals would be at least four (assuming one 6H signal overlaps), which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The total number of signals would be four, which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   The combination of these signals results in exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data for the aliphatic region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the mixtures, we must first understand the spectrum of each component. This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** This compound has ethyl groups, which produce a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-) due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. In many contexts, this AA' system appears as a single sharp signal. We will treat it as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This gives **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different chemical environments. This would give **four separate singlets (3H each)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test the remaining combinations against the experimental data (2 aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio; 3 aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene provides one 12H singlet. Prehnitene provides two 6H singlets. The mixture therefore shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit for all observations.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Prehnitene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene (one 2H singlet) + Isodurene (two 1H singlets) = **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only mixture that produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the careful points and synthesizing the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's understand what the experimental data tells us about the 1:1 mixture.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" means there are two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these aromatic protons have no adjacent proton neighbors to cause splitting.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\": Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Three signals\" means there are three chemically distinct types of alkyl protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" strongly suggests the signals are from methyl (-CH3) groups attached to the benzene ring (or another quaternary carbon), as ethyl groups would produce quartets and triplets.\n    *   \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons for these three signals.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has two ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be a quartet and the -CH3 protons would be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture**. This immediately eliminates option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: While technically an AA' system, in introductory problems and often in practice, this appears as a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments (H4 is between two methyls, H6 is next to one). They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at (C1, C3), the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H** (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining options in a 1:1 ratio and compare to the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated in Step 2.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data (two signals).\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two signals from different compounds will appear as **two singlets**. Since each represents 2H, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This perfectly matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This perfectly matches the aliphatic data.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the problem, the correct answer can be determined by systematically predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for each compound and then for each possible mixture.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Individual Compounds**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound would show a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to the ethyl groups. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound is eliminated, and **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has:\n    *   One type of aromatic proton -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   One type of methyl group -> **1 aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Due to a plane of symmetry, it has:\n    *   One type of aromatic proton -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Two types of methyl groups -> **2 aliphatic singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** Due to a plane of symmetry, it has:\n    *   One type of aromatic proton -> **1 aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Three types of methyl groups -> **3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Aromatic Region Check:**\nA 1:1 mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two aromatic singlets, each corresponding to 2H. This results in a 1:1 ratio. This information does not distinguish between options A, B, and D.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Check (The Deciding Factor):**\nWe need a combination that results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n    *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total: At least four distinct signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Total: Exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):**\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total: Four distinct signals. This is incorrect.\n\nOnly the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is consistent with all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the spectrum for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information. It implies that the protons giving rise to these signals have no chemically non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbon atoms.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the molecular symmetry of each candidate to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H. (Note: While adjacent equivalent protons can sometimes form complex multiplets, in introductory problems and many real-world cases for such symmetric molecules, they appear as a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. H4 is between two methyl groups, while H6 is next to only one methyl group. This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in three or four distinct chemical environments, which would lead to at least **three aliphatic singlets**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- signal will be a **quartet**, and the -CH3- signal will be a **triplet**. This directly contradicts the experimental data that all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can immediately eliminate any option containing **1,4-diethylbenzene**.\n*   This eliminates option B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nNow, let's test the remaining combinations for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.

It defined the target spectrum from the problem description: two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio and three aliphatic singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n3.  It then iterated through the four multiple-choice options, combining the predicted signals for each pair of compounds.\n4.  The script found that only the mixture in **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene)** produced a combined spectrum that matched the target:\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 12H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides two 6H singlets. The mixture correctly shows three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, which corresponds to the required 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nAll other options were found to be inconsistent with the experimental data, either by producing the wrong number of signals or signals with the wrong multiplicity (e.g., quartets/triplets instead of singlets).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine which two compounds are present in the mixture, we will systematically analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**1.

This results in **two distinct singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or **2:1:1**).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, symmetrically equivalent protons in an AA' system like this typically appear as a single sharp signal. This results in **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H (or **1:1**).\n\n**3.

This gives **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (which is 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent and appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (6H). This gives **two singlets** with a 6H:6H ratio (which is 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups show splitting. The -CH2- signal is a **quartet** and the -CH3- signal is a **triplet**. This does not match the \"all singlets\" data for the alkyl region.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe can immediately eliminate any option containing **1,4-diethylbenzene** because its alkyl signals are not singlets. This rules out option D.\n\nNow let's test the remaining options against the data (2 aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio; 3 alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** This mixture would show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-). This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H or **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives two 6H singlets. The combination results in **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **This option is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** This mixture would show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-). This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
