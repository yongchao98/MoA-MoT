Identification of Key Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\". This is equivalent to 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is a near-perfect match. Therefore, Substance B is heavy water. This is a crucial first step correctly identified by most of the detailed analyses (e.g., Answers 2, 4, 7, 8, 12, 16, 17).\n*   **Gas W:** The gas molecule contains an equal number of protons and neutrons. Since the involvement of deuterium (D, the heavier isotope of hydrogen) is established from the identity of B, the most logical candidate for W is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **Substance X:** The problem provides several clues:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (deuterium).\n    *   Its close analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with only two oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) has three oxygen atoms. A reduction to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) would result in a product with two oxygen atoms. This requires a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n    *   The most common strong reducing agent of this type is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n**2. Verification of the Reaction**\n\nLet's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the entire reaction sequence.\n*   The reaction is between Substance X (LiAlD₄) and liquid Y. Given the context, Y is most likely heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n*   This reaction is known to be violent.\n*   It produces gas W (D₂), which matches our deduction.\n*   It produces a precipitate G. Aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate, so its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate.\n*   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to release B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n*   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The masses of all atoms of these elements must be summed.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium isotope (²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** The sum of the masses from the lightest and heaviest elements is:\n    *   8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Substances\n\n1.  **Substance B:** The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a near-perfect match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that deuterium is involved, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Substance X and the Reaction:**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Analysis:** A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains at least three oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces this to a product with two oxygen atoms must be a strong reduction, converting both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups into alcohols (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, a diol). Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous strong reducing agent that does this. Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X perfectly.\n    *   **Reaction Verification:** Let's test the reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with Y. The products are W (D₂) and a precipitate G that releases B (D₂O) on heating. This suggests Y is D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n        *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G).\n        *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing D₂O (B): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   All clues are consistent. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\n1.  **Identify Elements in X (LiAlD₄):** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n2.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest element, and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest.\n3.  **Sum the Masses:** We must sum the masses of all atoms of Hydrogen and all atoms of Aluminum in the formula LiAlD₄. We use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Hydrogen isotopes = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Since the problem involves a heavier isotope and we've identified D₂O, the most logical candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** X contains a heavier isotope (which we've deduced is Deuterium).\n    *   **Clue 2:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent where hydrogen is replaced by deuterium.\n    *   **Clue 3:** The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, both functional groups must be reduced to alcohols (-OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Analysis:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry that can perform this reduction. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**, **Y = D₂O** (a liquid that reacts violently with X), **W = D₂**, **G = Al(OD)₃**, and **B = D₂O**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G).\n    *   **Heating G:** When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n    *   The problem specifies summing the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the molecule, using the masses of the specific isotopes present. We will use integer mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**.\n\nThis calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe problem states that the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Since we have identified D₂O, it is highly likely that the heavier isotope involved in the reaction is deuterium (D).\n*   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   This perfectly matches the description. Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nSeveral clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as Deuterium).\n*   It and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n*   It reacts violently with a liquid (Y) to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G).\n*   The precipitate G, when heated, releases D₂O (B). This implies G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, e.g., M(OD)n.\n*   The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups must be reduced to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n\nConsidering these points, a prime candidate for the \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Substance X would then be its deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction Scheme**\nLet's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues. The reaction with liquid Y (which must be D₂O to provide the deuteroxide) would be:\nLiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Violent reaction:** Yes, this reaction is known to be violent.\n*   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which matches.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is the deuterated analog of the insoluble aluminum hydroxide, so it would be a precipitate. This matches.\n*   **Heating G releases B:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O), releasing D₂O (B). This matches.\n*   **Keto acid reaction:** LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to perform the required reduction. This matches.\nAll clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** (Z=1) and the **heaviest element is Aluminum** (Z=13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the formula. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Sum = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since we know deuterium is involved, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

Execute the Plan: Step-by-Step Deduction**\n\n*   **Identify Substance B:** The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a near-perfect match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n*   **Identify Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since the reaction involves a heavier isotope and we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   This fits the description perfectly. Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   **Clue:** X contains a heavier isotope (now known to be D) and its analog is a common organic chemistry reagent. This points to a deuterated version of a common reagent.\n    *   **Clue:** The reaction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms, e.g., R-CO-COOH) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This means both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups were reduced to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous strong reducing agent. Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all these clues.\n\n*   **Verify the Entire Reaction:**\n    *   Let's assume X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O (since all other components are deuterated).\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces gas W (D₂).\n    *   It produces a precipitate G (Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃).\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose and release B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**3. Execute the Plan: Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Question:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   **Sum the masses:** The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the formula. We use integer mass numbers for this calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option A. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many correctly deduce the identity of Substance X and perform the calculation to get 35, they often select the wrong final letter. The reasoning and calculation are sound, and the result is unambiguously 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance B\nThe melting point of substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Gas W\nGas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   Since the involvement of deuterium (D) is established from Substance B, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Substance X\nMultiple clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (deuterium).\n*   Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n*   It reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction to a product with 2 oxygens (e.g., a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) requires a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n*   The most common strong reducing agent of this type is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Reaction Chemistry\nLet's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄, Y = D₂O, G = Al(OD)₃, and B = D₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction is known to be violent.\n*   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n*   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G), which is a precipitate.\n*   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n*   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of 2.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum of the masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** Its melting point is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since the involvement of deuterium is now established, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n*   **Precipitate G:** G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide decomposing into a metal oxide and heavy water. For example, M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n**2. Identification of Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as Deuterium) and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n*   **Clue 2:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction to a product with 2 oxygen atoms (e.g., a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) requires a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a common reducing agent but is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common, powerful reducing agent that *does* reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **Conclusion:** The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, which means **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**3. Verification of the Reaction**\n\nLet's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the reaction clues, assuming liquid Y is D₂O (heavy water).\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Violent Reaction:** The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent, so this is consistent.\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas, which matches our earlier identification.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide is a known gelatinous precipitate, so this is consistent.\n*   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause it to decompose and release D₂O (Substance B), which is also consistent.\n*   All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   The problem specifies to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these elements present in the molecule, using the masses of the specific isotopes. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly identify LiAlD₄ and calculate the value of 35, many incorrectly map this result to the wrong letter option. The correct calculation leads to 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step chemical deduction to identify the unknown substances and then perform a calculation based on the molecular formula of \"Substance X\".\n\n**Analysis of the Clues**\n\n1.  **Substance B's Melting Point**: The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Gas W's Composition**: The molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since the context involves a heavier isotope and heavy water, Deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identity of Substance X**:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as Deuterium).\n    *   It and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent where hydrogen is replaced by deuterium.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (which contains at least 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a powerful reduction that converts both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups into alcohols.\n    *   A common reagent capable of this strong reduction is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Reaction**: Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the entire reaction sequence.\n    *   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is indeed violent.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n    *   This produces D₂ gas (W), as identified.\n    *   It produces a precipitate G. Aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate, so its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   **Mass Calculation**: We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). Its mass number is **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are four atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H). The mass number of Deuterium is **2**. The total mass is 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Sum**: 27 (from Aluminum) + 8 (from Deuterium) = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n*   **Heavier Isotope:** Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given the context of deuterium, the gas D₂ is the most logical candidate. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n*   **Precipitate G:** G is a precipitate that releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This indicates G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)n, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n**2. Identification of Substance X**\n\n*   **Reaction Clues:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate G. This strongly suggests X is a metal deuteride and Y is D₂O. The reaction would be: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W).\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues:** Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The reaction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A keto acid has both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   To reduce the oxygen count from 3 to 2, a strong reducing agent is needed to reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) while also reducing the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-). The resulting product is a diol, which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A powerful reducing agent that fits this description is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Verification:** Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The reaction with Y (D₂O) is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   This reaction is violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases D₂O (B).\n    *   All clues are consistent. Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the formula, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D or ²H) isotope.

Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nThe gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given the involvement of deuterium, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A single deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\nSeveral clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium).\n*   Its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   It reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (general structure R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) would result in a 2-oxygen product. This requires a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n*   The most common strong reducing agent with these properties is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n*   Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the descriptions for Substance X.\n\n**4. Verification of the Entire Reaction**\nLet's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄, Y = D₂O, W = D₂, G = Al(OD)₃, and B = D₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction is known to be violent. (Clue met)\n*   It produces D₂ gas. (Clue met)\n*   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate.

The cumulative mass of the four deuterium atoms is 4 × 2 = 8. The mass of the single aluminum atom is 27.\n4.  **Final Answer**: The sum of these masses is 8 + 27 = 35. This result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Therefore, substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Since the involvement of a heavier hydrogen isotope (deuterium, D) is established by the identity of B, the most logical candidate for W is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (²H) contains one proton and one neutron. Consequently, a D₂ molecule contains two protons and two neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n3.  **Identify Precipitate G and Liquid Y:** Precipitate G releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes to a metal oxide and heavy water. The reaction that forms G and W is violent and involves substance X and liquid Y. Given the products, it is logical that liquid Y is also heavy water (D₂O).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The problem states that X contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as deuterium) and that its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   A crucial clue is that the reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with only two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains at least three oxygen atoms (in a ketone group, C=O, and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). The reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH) is required to reduce the oxygen count. This is a powerful reduction.\n    *   Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent capable of this transformation. Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits every clue for Substance X.\n    *   Let's verify the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W). This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate of aluminum deuteroxide (G). Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would release D₂O (B). All conditions are met.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula, using their integer mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of D is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.

Analysis of the Chemical Clues**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying several unknown substances (X, Y, W, G, B) based on a series of clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance B's Melting Point**\n    *   The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Gas W's Composition**\n    *   The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since we've identified heavy water, the involvement of deuterium is highly likely. Let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the clue perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: The Reaction and Precipitate G**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n    *   When precipitate G is heated, it releases substance B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide decomposing into a metal oxide and heavy water (e.g., M(OD)ₓ → MₓOᵧ + D₂O).\n\n*   **Clue 4: Substance X's Identity**\n    *   X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is deuterium).\n    *   X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   The product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count to 2, a strong reducing agent is needed to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH).\n    *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavier isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   This candidate for X fits all the clues.\n\n*   **Clue 5: Verifying the Entire Reaction**\n    *   Let's assume X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O (a logical choice for the liquid reactant).\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces gas W (D₂).\n    *   It produces a precipitate G (Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃).\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### **2. Calculation of the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Atomic Numbers**: H (1), Li (3), Al (13).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminum.\n*   **Isotopes in the molecule**:\n    *   The lightest element, Hydrogen, is present as four atoms of its heavier isotope, **Deuterium (D or ²H)**. The mass number of D is **2**.\n    *   The heaviest element, Aluminum, is present as one atom. Its most stable isotope is **²⁷Al**. The mass number is **27**.\n*   **Summation**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium) = 4 atoms × 2 = **8**.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 atom × 27 = **27**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass** = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct deductions and identifying key points for a careful solution.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n*   **Clue:** The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Analysis:** Converting Kelvin to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   **Conclusion:** The match is excellent. Substance B is **D₂O (heavy water)**. This is a critical first step, as it identifies the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem as **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\n*   **Clue:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   **Analysis:** Since we have established that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂). A single deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** This perfectly fits the description. Gas W is **D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains deuterium. Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n*   **Clue 2:** The reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count, both the ketone group and the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to alcohol groups (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Analysis:** A common laboratory reducing agent, sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. However, lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent that can perform this exact transformation.\n*   **Conclusion:** The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Therefore, Substance X, its deuterated version, is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**4. Verification of the Entire Reaction Sequence**\n*   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues. The reaction is between X and liquid Y, which, given the context, must be D₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Verification Points:**\n    *   The reaction is described as violent, which is true for the reaction of LiAlD₄ with water.\n    *   It produces gas W (D₂), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate G. Aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate, so its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate.\n    *   Heating precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose and release substance B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n*   **Conclusion:** All clues are consistent. The identification of X as LiAlD₄ is correct.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n*   **Task:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Mass Summation:** The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes present.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 25\nB) 35\nC) 31\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Identification of Key Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point is stated to be \"very close to 277 K\". This is equivalent to 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is a near-perfect match. Therefore, Substance B is heavy water. This is a crucial first step correctly identified by most of the detailed analyses (e.g., Answers 2, 4, 7, 8, 12, 16, 17).\n*   **Gas W:** The gas molecule contains an equal number of protons and neutrons. Since the involvement of deuterium (D, the heavier isotope of hydrogen) is established from the identity of B, the most logical candidate for W is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **Substance X:** The problem provides several clues:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (deuterium).\n    *   Its close analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with only two oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH) has three oxygen atoms. A reduction to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) would result in a product with two oxygen atoms. This requires a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n    *   The most common strong reducing agent of this type is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n**2. Verification of the Reaction**\n\nLet's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the entire reaction sequence.\n*   The reaction is between Substance X (LiAlD₄) and liquid Y. Given the context, Y is most likely heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n*   This reaction is known to be violent.\n*   It produces gas W (D₂), which matches our deduction.\n*   It produces a precipitate G. Aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate, so its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate.\n*   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to release B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n*   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The masses of all atoms of these elements must be summed.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium isotope (²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** The sum of the masses from the lightest and heaviest elements is:\n    *   8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Substances\n\n1.  **Substance B:** The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a near-perfect match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that deuterium is involved, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Substance X and the Reaction:**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Analysis:** A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains at least three oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces this to a product with two oxygen atoms must be a strong reduction, converting both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups into alcohols (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, a diol). Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous strong reducing agent that does this. Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X perfectly.\n    *   **Reaction Verification:** Let's test the reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with Y. The products are W (D₂) and a precipitate G that releases B (D₂O) on heating. This suggests Y is D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n        *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G).\n        *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing D₂O (B): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   All clues are consistent. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\n1.  **Identify Elements in X (LiAlD₄):** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n2.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest element, and Aluminum (Z=13) is the heaviest.\n3.  **Sum the Masses:** We must sum the masses of all atoms of Hydrogen and all atoms of Aluminum in the formula LiAlD₄. We use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Hydrogen isotopes = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Since the problem involves a heavier isotope and we've identified D₂O, the most logical candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** X contains a heavier isotope (which we've deduced is Deuterium).\n    *   **Clue 2:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent where hydrogen is replaced by deuterium.\n    *   **Clue 3:** The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, both functional groups must be reduced to alcohols (-OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Analysis:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry that can perform this reduction. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**, **Y = D₂O** (a liquid that reacts violently with X), **W = D₂**, **G = Al(OD)₃**, and **B = D₂O**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G).\n    *   **Heating G:** When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n    *   The problem specifies summing the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the molecule, using the masses of the specific isotopes present. We will use integer mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = **35**.\n\nThis calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe problem states that the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Since we have identified D₂O, it is highly likely that the heavier isotope involved in the reaction is deuterium (D).\n*   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   This perfectly matches the description. Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\nSeveral clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as Deuterium).\n*   It and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n*   It reacts violently with a liquid (Y) to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G).\n*   The precipitate G, when heated, releases D₂O (B). This implies G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, e.g., M(OD)n.\n*   The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups must be reduced to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n\nConsidering these points, a prime candidate for the \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Substance X would then be its deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction Scheme**\nLet's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues. The reaction with liquid Y (which must be D₂O to provide the deuteroxide) would be:\nLiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Violent reaction:** Yes, this reaction is known to be violent.\n*   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which matches.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is the deuterated analog of the insoluble aluminum hydroxide, so it would be a precipitate. This matches.\n*   **Heating G releases B:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O), releasing D₂O (B). This matches.\n*   **Keto acid reaction:** LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to perform the required reduction. This matches.\nAll clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** (Z=1) and the **heaviest element is Aluminum** (Z=13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the formula. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Sum = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since we know deuterium is involved, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X contains deuterium and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms, e.g., R-CO-COOH) with substance X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This means both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups were reduced to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄** and it reacts with liquid **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces gas **W = D₂**.\n    *   It produces a precipitate **G = Al(OD)₃** (aluminum deuteroxide, analogous to the precipitate aluminum hydroxide).\n    *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to release **B = D₂O** (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent with this identification.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using their integer mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (²H).

A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to alcohol groups (-OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Analysis:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent that performs this exact transformation. Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits all the clues so far.\n    *   **Confirmation:** Let's assume **X is LiAlD₄**.

This points to a deuterated version of a common reagent.\n    *   **Clue:** The reaction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms, e.g., R-CO-COOH) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.

Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option A.

The reasoning and calculation are sound, and the result is unambiguously 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance B\nThe melting point of substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Gas W\nGas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n*   Since the involvement of deuterium (D) is established from Substance B, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Substance X\nMultiple clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (deuterium).\n*   Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n*   It reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction to a product with 2 oxygens (e.g., a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) requires a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n*   The most common strong reducing agent of this type is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Reaction Chemistry\nLet's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄, Y = D₂O, G = Al(OD)₃, and B = D₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction is known to be violent.\n*   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n*   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G), which is a precipitate.\n*   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n*   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of 2.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum of the masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** Its melting point is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since the involvement of deuterium is now established, let's examine deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n*   **Precipitate G:** G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide decomposing into a metal oxide and heavy water. For example, M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n**2. Identification of Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as Deuterium) and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n*   **Clue 2:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction to a product with 2 oxygen atoms (e.g., a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) requires a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a common reducing agent but is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common, powerful reducing agent that *does* reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **Conclusion:** The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, which means **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**3. Verification of the Reaction**\n\nLet's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the reaction clues, assuming liquid Y is D₂O (heavy water).\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Violent Reaction:** The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent, so this is consistent.\n*   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas, which matches our earlier identification.\n*   **Precipitate G:** The reaction produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide is a known gelatinous precipitate, so this is consistent.\n*   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause it to decompose and release D₂O (Substance B), which is also consistent.\n*   All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   The problem specifies to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these elements present in the molecule, using the masses of the specific isotopes. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly identify LiAlD₄ and calculate the value of 35, many incorrectly map this result to the wrong letter option. The correct calculation leads to 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step chemical deduction to identify the unknown substances and then perform a calculation based on the molecular formula of \"Substance X\".\n\n**Analysis of the Clues**\n\n1.  **Substance B's Melting Point**: The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Gas W's Composition**: The molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Since the context involves a heavier isotope and heavy water, Deuterium gas (D₂) is the most logical candidate. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identity of Substance X**:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as Deuterium).\n    *   It and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent where hydrogen is replaced by deuterium.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (which contains at least 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a powerful reduction that converts both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups into alcohols.\n    *   A common reagent capable of this strong reduction is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues for Substance X.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Reaction**: Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the entire reaction sequence.\n    *   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is indeed violent.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n    *   This produces D₂ gas (W), as identified.\n    *   It produces a precipitate G. Aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate, so its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing B (D₂O): 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   **Mass Calculation**: We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). Its mass number is **27**.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are four atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H). The mass number of Deuterium is **2**. The total mass is 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Sum**: 27 (from Aluminum) + 8 (from Deuterium) = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B:** The melting point is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), which is an excellent match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n*   **Heavier Isotope:** Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen.\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given the context of deuterium, the gas D₂ is the most logical candidate. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n*   **Precipitate G:** G is a precipitate that releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This indicates G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)n, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n**2. Identification of Substance X**\n\n*   **Reaction Clues:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate G. This strongly suggests X is a metal deuteride and Y is D₂O. The reaction would be: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W).\n*   **Organic Chemistry Clues:** Substance X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The reaction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A keto acid has both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   To reduce the oxygen count from 3 to 2, a strong reducing agent is needed to reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) while also reducing the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-). The resulting product is a diol, which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A powerful reducing agent that fits this description is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Verification:** Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The reaction with Y (D₂O) is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   This reaction is violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases D₂O (B).\n    *   All clues are consistent. Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the formula, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D or ²H) isotope. The mass number of D is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   The value 277 K is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nThe gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given the involvement of deuterium, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n*   A single deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n*   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\nSeveral clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n*   It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium).\n*   Its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   It reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (general structure R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) would result in a 2-oxygen product. This requires a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n*   The most common strong reducing agent with these properties is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n*   Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the descriptions for Substance X.\n\n**4. Verification of the Entire Reaction**\nLet's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄, Y = D₂O, W = D₂, G = Al(OD)₃, and B = D₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   This reaction is known to be violent. (Clue met)\n*   It produces D₂ gas. (Clue met)\n*   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a precipitate. (Clue met)\n*   When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). (Clue met)\n*   All clues are consistent with **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   Based on atomic number, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n*   The problem specifies to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the molecule, using the masses of the specific isotopes present. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n*   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** The sum of these masses is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully executed the plan to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n1.  **Substance Identification**: By analyzing the clues, Substance X was correctly identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n2.  **Element Identification**: The lightest element in LiAlD₄ is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D), and the heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n3.  **Mass Calculation**: The calculation was performed according to the problem's instructions. The cumulative mass of the four deuterium atoms is 4 × 2 = 8. The mass of the single aluminum atom is 27.\n4.  **Final Answer**: The sum of these masses is 8 + 27 = 35. This result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Therefore, substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Since the involvement of a heavier hydrogen isotope (deuterium, D) is established by the identity of B, the most logical candidate for W is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (²H) contains one proton and one neutron. Consequently, a D₂ molecule contains two protons and two neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n3.  **Identify Precipitate G and Liquid Y:** Precipitate G releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes to a metal oxide and heavy water. The reaction that forms G and W is violent and involves substance X and liquid Y. Given the products, it is logical that liquid Y is also heavy water (D₂O).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The problem states that X contains a heavier isotope (which we've identified as deuterium) and that its \"very close analog\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   A crucial clue is that the reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with only two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains at least three oxygen atoms (in a ketone group, C=O, and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). The reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH) is required to reduce the oxygen count. This is a powerful reduction.\n    *   Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent capable of this transformation. Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits every clue for Substance X.\n    *   Let's verify the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W). This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate of aluminum deuteroxide (G). Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would release D₂O (B). All conditions are met.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula, using their integer mass numbers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of D is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Chemical Clues**\n\nThe problem is a chemical puzzle that requires identifying several unknown substances (X, Y, W, G, B) based on a series of clues.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance B's Melting Point**\n    *   The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Gas W's Composition**\n    *   The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Since we've identified heavy water, the involvement of deuterium is highly likely. Let's examine deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the clue perfectly. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: The Reaction and Precipitate G**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G.\n    *   When precipitate G is heated, it releases substance B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide decomposing into a metal oxide and heavy water (e.g., M(OD)ₓ → MₓOᵧ + D₂O).\n\n*   **Clue 4: Substance X's Identity**\n    *   X contains a heavier isotope (which we know is deuterium).\n    *   X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   The product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce the oxygen count to 2, a strong reducing agent is needed to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups to alcohols (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH).\n    *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavier isotope is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   This candidate for X fits all the clues.\n\n*   **Clue 5: Verifying the Entire Reaction**\n    *   Let's assume X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O (a logical choice for the liquid reactant).\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces gas W (D₂).\n    *   It produces a precipitate G (Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃).\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases B (D₂O).\n    *   All clues are consistent. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### **2.

The mass number of D is **2**.\n    *   The heaviest element, Aluminum, is present as one atom. Its most stable isotope is **²⁷Al**. The mass number is **27**.\n*   **Summation**: The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium) = 4 atoms × 2 = **8**.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 atom × 27 = **27**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass** = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### **3.
