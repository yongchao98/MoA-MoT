The consensus on the numerical result is extremely strong.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Process\n\nThe question describes the process of pair production, where a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to create an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\nThe question asks for the energy at which this process begins to limit the lifetime of gamma-rays. This is equivalent to finding the minimum or *threshold energy* ($E_\\gamma$) for this reaction to occur.\n\n### 2. Apply Relativistic Kinematics\n\nThe threshold energy is determined by the conservation of energy and momentum, which is most easily handled using the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, the square of the center-of-mass energy.\n\n*   **In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:** At the threshold, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible energy, which is their combined rest mass energy. They are created at rest in this frame.\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron = $m_e c^2$\n    *   Rest mass energy of a positron = $m_e c^2$\n    *   Total energy in CM frame at threshold: $E_{CM} = 2m_e c^2$\n    *   The invariant $s$ is therefore: $s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n*   **In the Lab Frame:** We consider the collision between the high-energy photon ($E_\\gamma$) and the CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$). The invariant $s$ can also be calculated in this frame.\n    *   $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n\n### 3. Determine the Minimum Threshold Energy\n\nThe threshold energy $E_\\gamma$ will be at its minimum when the collision is most efficient. This occurs in a head-on collision, where the photons travel directly towards each other ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians). In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized to a value of 2.\n\n*   The expression for $s$ becomes: $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - (-1)) = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n\n### 4. Solve for the Threshold Energy\n\nBy equating the expressions for $s$ from both frames, we can solve for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n$4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nThis is the definitive formula for the threshold energy of the high-energy photon.\n\n### 5. Perform the Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the given and known values into the formula.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Use the correct physical constants.** The rest mass energy of an electron is a well-known value: $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Be consistent with units.** We must convert all energy values to a common unit, such as electron-volts (eV).\n    *   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n    *   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$ (as given in the problem)\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### 6. Final Unit Conversion and Answer Selection\n\nThe options are given in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). We must convert our result.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Use the correct conversion factor.** $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Match the result to the correct option.** We compare our calculated value to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\n    B) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n    C) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n    D) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur result, $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV, matches option D. The vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly calculate this value, even if some incorrectly map it to a letter due to shuffled option lists. The underlying physics and calculation are consistent.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, followed by a list of careful points to consider, and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The question describes the creation of an electron-positron pair from the collision of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Apply Relativistic Kinematics:** For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products (one electron and one positron). The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2$, so the minimum energy required in the CM frame is $E_{CM, min} = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n3.  **Use Lorentz Invariance:** The square of the center-of-mass energy, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant quantity. We can calculate its value in both the CM frame and the lab frame and set them equal.\n    *   In the CM frame at threshold: $s = (E_{CM, min})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n    *   In the lab frame, $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$. Since photons are massless, $p_\\gamma^2 = p_{CMB}^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the collision angle.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Threshold Energy:** The question asks for the energy from which the gamma-ray lifetime is limited. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy for the reaction to occur. To find the minimum $E_\\gamma$, we must consider the most efficient collision, which is a head-on collision ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians). In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized to 2.\n    *   The expression for $s$ becomes: $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(2) = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$.\n\n5.  **Derive the Threshold Formula:** By equating the expressions for $s$ from the two frames, we get:\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n    Solving for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n7.  **Convert to Final Units:** The options are in Giga-electron Volts (GeV).

This matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Threshold Condition:** The problem asks for the energy *from which* the lifetime is limited, which implies finding the minimum possible energy, or the absolute threshold, for the reaction to occur.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** This problem must be solved using relativistic kinematics. The simple addition of energies is incorrect. Using the invariance of the four-momentum squared ($s$) is the standard and most reliable method.\n*   **Collision Angle:** The minimum threshold energy for the high-energy photon occurs for a head-on collision ($\\theta=180^\\circ$). For any other angle, the required energy for the high-energy gamma-ray would be even higher. Since the CMB is an isotropic photon bath, head-on collisions will occur, setting the absolute energy threshold.\n*   **Formula Accuracy:** The correct formula is $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$. A common mistake is to misplace a factor of 2 or 4 during the derivation.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial to ensure all units are consistent before calculation (e.g., converting the electron's rest mass energy from MeV to eV) and to convert the final answer to the units required by the options (GeV).\n*   **Matching to Options:** After obtaining the correct numerical result ($2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV), it is essential to carefully match it to the correct option letter. A review of the candidate answers shows that while the calculation was almost universally correct, many agents failed at this final step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The question describes the creation of an electron-positron pair from the collision of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) and a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

The products are an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$), each with a rest mass energy of $m_e c^2$. Therefore, the minimum energy required in the CM frame is $E_{CM, min} = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Kinematics:** The square of the center-of-mass energy, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant.

The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Threshold Condition**: For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products. The products are an electron and a positron, each with a rest mass energy of $m_e c^2$. Therefore, the minimum energy required in the CM frame is $E_{CM, min} = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Relativistic Kinematics**: The most straightforward way to solve this is by using the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, which is the square of the total four-momentum.

The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. The question asks for the energy threshold at which this process becomes significant, thereby limiting the distance high-energy gamma-rays can travel.\n\n2.  **Apply Relativistic Kinematics:** The solution requires finding the minimum energy ($E_\\gamma$) for the high-energy photon that allows this reaction to occur. This is a classic relativistic kinematics problem. The most straightforward method is to use the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, the square of the total four-momentum of the system.\n\n3.  **Calculate Invariant Mass ($s$):**\n    *   **In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:** At the threshold, the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy. The total energy in the CM frame is just the sum of their rest mass energies: $E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$. The total momentum is zero. Therefore, $s = (E_{CM}/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}_{CM}|^2 = (2m_e c)^2 = 4m_e^2 c^2$.\n    *   **In the Lab Frame:** Let the high-energy photon have energy $E_\\gamma$ and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$. The invariant mass squared is $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$. Since photons are massless, $p_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.

The reaction is:\n    $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Relativistic Principles:** For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products (an electron and a positron). This minimum energy is the threshold energy.\n\n3.  **Determine the Threshold Energy in the CM Frame:** The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$, and a positron has the same mass. At the threshold, the electron and positron are created with no kinetic energy in the CM frame. Therefore, the minimum required energy in the CM frame is the sum of their rest mass energies:\n    $E_{CM, threshold} = m_e c^2 + m_{e^+} c^2 = 2m_e c^2$\n\n4.  **Use Lorentz Invariance:** The square of the center-of-mass energy, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant. This means its value is the same in all inertial reference frames. We can equate the value of $s$ in the CM frame and the lab frame.\n    *   In the CM frame: $s = (E_{CM, threshold})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    *   In the lab frame, let the four-momenta of the two photons be $p_{\\gamma}$ and $p_{CMB}$. Then $s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2$. For photons, $p^2=0$, so this expands to $s = 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the photons.\n\n5.  **Find the Minimum Threshold Energy:** The question asks for the energy from which the lifetime is limited, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy for the reaction to occur. To find the minimum $E_{\\gamma}$, we must consider the most efficient collision, which maximizes the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. This occurs in a head-on collision where the photons move directly towards each other ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians), making $\\cos\\theta = -1$. In this case, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 2$.\n\n6.  **Derive the Final Formula:** By equating the two expressions for $s$ for a head-on collision at the threshold:\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 2E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB}(2)$\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB}$\n    Solving for the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray gives:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:** We substitute the given and known values into the formula:\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$ (as given in the problem).\n\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n8.  **Convert to Final Units:** The options are given in Giga-electron Volts (GeV).

The factor of 2 from the total rest mass energy is cancelled out during the derivation for a head-on collision.\n*   **Collision Angle:** The calculation assumes the most energy-efficient case, a head-on collision. Since the CMB is an isotropic bath of photons, gamma-rays will encounter photons from all angles, but the process becomes possible as soon as the energy is sufficient for a head-on collision.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial to be consistent with units. The electron rest mass energy is typically given in MeV and must be converted to eV before squaring.

Understand the Physical Process**\nThe question describes the process of pair production from a photon-photon collision: a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to create an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$).\nThe reaction is: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\n**2. Identify the Threshold Condition**\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame of the two colliding photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the particles being created.\n*   The products are an electron and a positron, each with a rest mass energy of $m_e c^2$.\n*   Therefore, the minimum energy required in the CM frame is $E_{CM, min} = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n**3. Apply Relativistic Kinematics**\nThe most straightforward way to solve this is by using the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, which is the square of the total four-momentum of the system. Its value is the same in all inertial frames.\n\n*   **In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:** At the threshold, the total energy is $E_{CM} = 2m_e c^2$ and the total momentum is zero. So, $s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n*   **In the Lab Frame:** Let the high-energy photon have energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$. The invariant mass squared is $s = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n\n**4. Find the Minimum Threshold Energy**\nThe question asks for the energy from which the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy for the gamma-ray to undergo this reaction. To find the minimum $E_{\\gamma}$, we must consider the most efficient collision scenario, which maximizes the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.

Understand the Physical Process\n\nThe question describes the process of pair production, where a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to create an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\nThe question asks for the energy at which this process begins to limit the lifetime of gamma-rays. This is equivalent to finding the minimum or *threshold energy* ($E_\\gamma$) for this reaction to occur.\n\n### 2. Apply Relativistic Kinematics\n\nThe threshold energy is determined by the conservation of energy and momentum, which is most easily handled using the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, the square of the center-of-mass energy.\n\n*   **In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:** At the threshold, the electron and positron are created with the minimum possible energy, which is their combined rest mass energy. They are created at rest in this frame.\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron = $m_e c^2$\n    *   Rest mass energy of a positron = $m_e c^2$\n    *   Total energy in CM frame at threshold: $E_{CM} = 2m_e c^2$\n    *   The invariant $s$ is therefore: $s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n*   **In the Lab Frame:** We consider the collision between the high-energy photon ($E_\\gamma$) and the CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$). The invariant $s$ can also be calculated in this frame.\n    *   $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n\n### 3. Determine the Minimum Threshold Energy\n\nThe threshold energy $E_\\gamma$ will be at its minimum when the collision is most efficient. This occurs in a head-on collision, where the photons travel directly towards each other ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians). In this case, $\\cos\\theta = -1$, and the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized to a value of 2.\n\n*   The expression for $s$ becomes: $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - (-1)) = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n\n### 4. Solve for the Threshold Energy\n\nBy equating the expressions for $s$ from both frames, we can solve for the threshold energy $E_\\gamma$:\n$4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nThis is the definitive formula for the threshold energy of the high-energy photon.\n\n### 5. Perform the Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the given and known values into the formula.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Use the correct physical constants.** The rest mass energy of an electron is a well-known value: $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Be consistent with units.** We must convert all energy values to a common unit, such as electron-volts (eV).\n    *   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n    *   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$ (as given in the problem)\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### 6. Final Unit Conversion and Answer Selection\n\nThe options are given in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). We must convert our result.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Use the correct conversion factor.** $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Match the result to the correct option.** We compare our calculated value to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\n    B) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n    C) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n    D) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur result, $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV, matches option D. The vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly calculate this value, even if some incorrectly map it to a letter due to shuffled option lists.

The rest mass energy of an electron is $m_e c^2$, so the minimum energy required in the CM frame is $E_{CM, min} = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n3.  **Use Lorentz Invariance:** The square of the center-of-mass energy, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant quantity. We can calculate its value in both the CM frame and the lab frame and set them equal.\n    *   In the CM frame at threshold: $s = (E_{CM, min})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n    *   In the lab frame, $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$. Since photons are massless, $p_\\gamma^2 = p_{CMB}^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the collision angle.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Threshold Energy:** The question asks for the energy from which the gamma-ray lifetime is limited.

This matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Threshold Condition:** The problem asks for the energy *from which* the lifetime is limited, which implies finding the minimum possible energy, or the absolute threshold, for the reaction to occur.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** This problem must be solved using relativistic kinematics. The simple addition of energies is incorrect. Using the invariance of the four-momentum squared ($s$) is the standard and most reliable method.\n*   **Collision Angle:** The minimum threshold energy for the high-energy photon occurs for a head-on collision ($\\theta=180^\\circ$). For any other angle, the required energy for the high-energy gamma-ray would be even higher. Since the CMB is an isotropic photon bath, head-on collisions will occur, setting the absolute energy threshold.\n*   **Formula Accuracy:** The correct formula is $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$. A common mistake is to misplace a factor of 2 or 4 during the derivation.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial to ensure all units are consistent before calculation (e.g., converting the electron's rest mass energy from MeV to eV) and to convert the final answer to the units required by the options (GeV).\n*   **Matching to Options:** After obtaining the correct numerical result ($2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV), it is essential to carefully match it to the correct option letter.

The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Threshold Condition**: For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products. The products are an electron and a positron, each with a rest mass energy of $m_e c^2$. Therefore, the minimum energy required in the CM frame is $E_{CM, min} = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Relativistic Kinematics**: The most straightforward way to solve this is by using the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, which is the square of the total four-momentum.

The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. The question asks for the energy threshold at which this process becomes significant, thereby limiting the distance high-energy gamma-rays can travel.\n\n2.  **Apply Relativistic Kinematics:** The solution requires finding the minimum energy ($E_\\gamma$) for the high-energy photon that allows this reaction to occur. This is a classic relativistic kinematics problem. The most straightforward method is to use the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, the square of the total four-momentum of the system.\n\n3.  **Calculate Invariant Mass ($s$):**\n    *   **In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:** At the threshold, the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy. The total energy in the CM frame is just the sum of their rest mass energies: $E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$. The total momentum is zero. Therefore, $s = (E_{CM}/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}_{CM}|^2 = (2m_e c)^2 = 4m_e^2 c^2$.\n    *   **In the Lab Frame:** Let the high-energy photon have energy $E_\\gamma$ and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$. The invariant mass squared is $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$. Since photons are massless, $p_\\gamma^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $s = 2 p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2(E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.

The reaction is:\n    $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Relativistic Principles:** For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products (an electron and a positron). This minimum energy is the threshold energy.\n\n3.  **Determine the Threshold Energy in the CM Frame:** The rest mass of an electron is $m_e$, and a positron has the same mass. At the threshold, the electron and positron are created with no kinetic energy in the CM frame. Therefore, the minimum required energy in the CM frame is the sum of their rest mass energies:\n    $E_{CM, threshold} = m_e c^2 + m_{e^+} c^2 = 2m_e c^2$\n\n4.  **Use Lorentz Invariance:** The square of the center-of-mass energy, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant. This means its value is the same in all inertial reference frames. We can equate the value of $s$ in the CM frame and the lab frame.\n    *   In the CM frame: $s = (E_{CM, threshold})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    *   In the lab frame, let the four-momenta of the two photons be $p_{\\gamma}$ and $p_{CMB}$. Then $s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2$. For photons, $p^2=0$, so this expands to $s = 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the photons.\n\n5.  **Find the Minimum Threshold Energy:** The question asks for the energy from which the lifetime is limited, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy for the reaction to occur. To find the minimum $E_{\\gamma}$, we must consider the most efficient collision, which maximizes the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. This occurs in a head-on collision where the photons move directly towards each other ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians), making $\\cos\\theta = -1$. In this case, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 2$.\n\n6.  **Derive the Final Formula:** By equating the two expressions for $s$ for a head-on collision at the threshold:\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 2E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB}(2)$\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_{\\gamma, th}E_{CMB}$\n    Solving for the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray gives:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:** We substitute the given and known values into the formula:\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$ (as given in the problem).\n\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n8.  **Convert to Final Units:** The options are given in Giga-electron Volts (GeV).

The factor of 2 from the total rest mass energy is cancelled out during the derivation for a head-on collision.\n*   **Collision Angle:** The calculation assumes the most energy-efficient case, a head-on collision. Since the CMB is an isotropic bath of photons, gamma-rays will encounter photons from all angles, but the process becomes possible as soon as the energy is sufficient for a head-on collision.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial to be consistent with units. The electron rest mass energy is typically given in MeV and must be converted to eV before squaring. The final answer must be converted from eV to GeV to match the options.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly perform the calculation, many fail to select the correct final option letter. This is likely due to a scrambling of the option labels (A, B, C, D) in their individual analyses. The physics and the numerical result are overwhelmingly consistent across the candidates, pointing to a value of ~$2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\nThe question describes the process of pair production from a photon-photon collision: a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to create an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$).\nThe reaction is: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\n**2. Identify the Threshold Condition**\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame of the two colliding photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the particles being created.\n*   The products are an electron and a positron, each with a rest mass energy of $m_e c^2$.\n*   Therefore, the minimum energy required in the CM frame is $E_{CM, min} = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n**3. Apply Relativistic Kinematics**\nThe most straightforward way to solve this is by using the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, which is the square of the total four-momentum of the system. Its value is the same in all inertial frames.\n\n*   **In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:** At the threshold, the total energy is $E_{CM} = 2m_e c^2$ and the total momentum is zero. So, $s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n*   **In the Lab Frame:** Let the high-energy photon have energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$. The invariant mass squared is $s = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n\n**4. Find the Minimum Threshold Energy**\nThe question asks for the energy from which the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy for the gamma-ray to undergo this reaction. To find the minimum $E_{\\gamma}$, we must consider the most efficient collision scenario, which maximizes the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. This occurs during a head-on collision, where $\\theta = 180^\\circ$ (or $\\pi$ radians), making $\\cos\\theta = -1$. In this case, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 2$.\nThe expression for $s$ in the lab frame becomes: $s = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(2) = 4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}$.\n\n**5. Equate and Solve**\nNow, we equate the expressions for $s$ from the CM frame and the lab frame:\n$4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}$\nSolving for the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma}$:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**6.
