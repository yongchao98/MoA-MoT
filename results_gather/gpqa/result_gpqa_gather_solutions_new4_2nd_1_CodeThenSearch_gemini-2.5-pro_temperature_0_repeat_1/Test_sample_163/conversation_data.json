Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.\n\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This requires calculating the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physical Principles\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) by the following formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM_total = [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)\n\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Careful Points and Simplifications\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems **exhibit eclipses**.\n*   For an eclipse to occur, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n*   If `i` ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This significantly simplifies the mass formula.\n*   When calculating the ratio of the two masses (M_sys1 / M_sys2), the constant term `1 / (2πG)` will cancel out.\n\nThese simplifications lead to a direct proportionality:\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### Step 4: Collate Data and Perform Calculation\nLet's gather the data for each system and calculate the ratio.\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio using the proportionality:\n\nRatio = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nRatio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can handle the ratio of the velocities first:\n\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated factor is 0.432. We compare this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This requires calculating the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles\nThe problem involves double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system (M_total = m₁ + m₂) can be determined using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law, which relates the mass to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe formula is:\nM_total = [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂ )³ / sin³(i)\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n### 3. Analyze Careful Points and Simplifications\n*   **Eclipsing Systems:** This is the most critical piece of information. For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on from our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n*   **Simplification from Inclination:** If `i` ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1, and consequently sin³(i) ≈ 1. This allows us to remove the sin³(i) term from the formula for both systems.\n*   **Calculating a Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2. When we set up this ratio, any constant terms will cancel out. The term `1 / (2πG)` is a constant and will cancel.\n*   **Final Proportionality:** Due to these simplifications, the total mass of each system is directly proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of its velocity amplitudes:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Calculation\nFirst, let's list the data and calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system.\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNext, we set up the ratio using the proportionality derived above.\n\nMass Ratio = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\n\nNow, substitute the values into the equation. The units (years, km/s) will cancel out.\n\nMass Ratio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can handle the ratio of the velocities first:\n\nMass Ratio = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nMass Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nMass Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nMass Ratio = 54 / 125\nMass Ratio = 0.432\n\n### 5.

When we create this ratio, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out.\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   **For System 1:** P₁ = 2 years; K_total1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **For System 2:** P₂ = 1 year; K_total2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n    Plugging these into the ratio:\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Result:**\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) ~ 1.2\n    B) ~ 0.4\n    C) ~ 0.7\n    D) ~ 0.6\n\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue:** The most important detail is that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This justifies the critical simplification that the inclination angle `i` is ~90°, allowing the `sin³(i)` term to be ignored in the ratio calculation.\n*   **Sum of Velocities:** The formula requires the sum of the velocity amplitudes (K₁ + K₂) for each system, not the individual values.\n*   **Cubic Relationship:** The total mass is proportional to the *cube* of the sum of the velocities. Forgetting this exponent is a common mistake.\n*   **Ratio Simplification:** Setting up the problem as a ratio from the start is the most efficient method, as it cancels out the physical constants (`G`) and removes the need for unit conversions, as long as the units are consistent for both systems.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the correct analyses is that the calculation yields approximately 0.432, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including all the careful points, to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is a ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify Relevant Physical Principles:** The problem involves double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass of such a system can be found using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law, which relates the mass to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂).\n\n4.  **Analyze Careful Points and Simplifications:**\n    *   **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information. For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be viewed nearly edge-on from our line of sight. This means the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°.\n    *   **Inclination Simplification:** When *i* ≈ 90°, sin(*i*) ≈ 1. The full formula for the total mass is M₁ + M₂ = [ P / (2πG) ] * (K₁ + K₂ )³ / sin³(*i*). Since sin³(*i*) ≈ 1 for both systems, this term can be ignored when calculating the ratio.\n    *   **Proportionality:** Due to the simplifications, the total mass of the system is directly proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of its velocity amplitudes: M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³.\n    *   **Units:** When calculating the ratio, the gravitational constant (G) and other constants cancel out. We can use the given units (years and km/s) directly, as they will also cancel out, leaving a dimensionless factor.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for each system:\n        *   System 1 (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n        *   System 2 (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   Next, set up the ratio of the masses using the proportionality derived in step 4:\n        M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\n    *   Substitute the known values into the equation:\n        M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\n        M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n        M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n        M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\n    *   Calculate the final decimal value:\n        M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated factor is 0.432. This value must be compared to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) ~ 0.4\n    *   B) ~ 1.2\n    *   C) ~ 0.6\n    *   D) ~ 0.7\n\n    The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
