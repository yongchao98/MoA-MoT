    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal amplitude as the spotted star, we must first calculate the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation and then equate it to the dimming caused by a planetary transit.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Brightness Variation from Starspots\n\nThe variation in the star's brightness is due to its rotation, which alternately reveals a more spotted and a less spotted face to the observer. The amplitude of this variation is determined by the difference in flux between the star's most and least bright appearances.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's surface area and the fourth power of its effective temperature (T_eff), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction of its area, the filling factor (f), covered by cooler spots. The flux from this face is a combination of the flux from the normal photosphere and the cooler spots.\n    *   Temperature of the photosphere (T_eff) = 6000 K\n    *   Temperature of the spots (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Filling factor of spots (f) = 20% = 0.20\n\nThe relative amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is given by the formula:\n\nAmplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nThis simplifies to an expression dependent on the filling factor and the temperatures:\n\nAmplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - 625/1296)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.10355\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nAn exoplanet passing in front of its star causes a dip in brightness known as a transit. The depth of this transit is the fraction of the starlight blocked by the planet. For a simple case without limb darkening, this is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### Step 3: Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Planet's Radius\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that produces the same signal, we set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the variation from the starspots:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet is ~0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
