    "Based on the analysis of the reactions and the confirmation of the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents from the search results, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Starting Material and Product:**\n    *   The starting material, in its various stereoisomeric forms, is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu. The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n    *   The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. Its chiral center is at position 4, which corresponds to the chiral center of the starting material.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Reaction A:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄).\n    *   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, the isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu) of compound A will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains unchanged.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) where the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid group. This forms the six-membered lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** This sequence of reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) does not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be the (R)-enantiomer.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Reaction B:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃).\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of compound B will be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the isobutyl ester group remains intact.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction yields isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    *   **Cyclization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** As with reaction A, the chiral center is not affected during this reaction sequence, and its configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For Reaction A to yield (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   For Reaction B to yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
