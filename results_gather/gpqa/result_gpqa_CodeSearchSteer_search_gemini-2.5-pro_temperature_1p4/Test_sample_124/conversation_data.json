    "For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2r^2$. The energy eigenvalues for this system are determined by the principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers corresponding to the quantum numbers for one-dimensional harmonic oscillators along the three Cartesian axes. The formula for the energy levels is:\n\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThe different energy states are as follows:\n*   **Ground state (N=0):** $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state (N=1):** $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state (N=2):** $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state (N=3):** $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to the principal quantum number $N$. The formula for the degeneracy, $g_N$, is:\n\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have N=3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nThis means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state. The combinations of ($n_x, n_y, n_z$) that sum to 3 are:\n*   (3,0,0) - 3 permutations\n*   (2,1,0) - 6 permutations\n*   (1,1,1) - 1 permutation\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and it has a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
