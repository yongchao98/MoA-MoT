    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe overall reaction sequence involves the treatment of an alkene with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) followed by aqueous acid. This two-step process results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the double bond, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond. The stereochemical outcome depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of a *trans* (E) alkene with mCPBA results in a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this racemic epoxide mixture yields a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single meso compound.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of a *cis* (Z) alkene with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, which produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *anti*-attack of water on the meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two carbons of the epoxide ring, leading to the formation of a racemic mixture of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix) of two enantiomers.\n\n### **The Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct chemical species:\n1.  (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between the meso compound and either of the enantiomers is diastereomeric.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n**Standard (Achiral) HPLC:**\n*   A standard HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak. So, the racemic pair from Reaction 2—(4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol—will produce **one peak**.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on a standard column. The meso compound from Reaction 1 is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time and produce a **second peak**.\n*   **Result for Standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n*   The enantiomeric pair—(4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol—will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound is achiral and does not have an enantiomer. It will elute as a single, distinct peak. Since it is a diastereomer to the other two compounds, its retention time will be different. This results in a **third peak**.\n*   **Result for Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
