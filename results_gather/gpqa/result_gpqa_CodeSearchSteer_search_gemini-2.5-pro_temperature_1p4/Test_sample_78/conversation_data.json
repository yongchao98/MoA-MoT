    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction from its given ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra.\n\n**Product's Molecular Formula:** The reaction is described as an isomerization of compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O), so the product will have the same molecular formula.\n\n**¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically in a ketone that is part of a conjugated system.\n*   **δ 144.1, 141.5, 130.3, 129.1 (2C), 127.1, 126.9 (2C):** These signals are in the range for aromatic and alkene carbons. The presence of two signals each corresponding to two carbons (129.1 and 126.9 ppm) suggests a symmetrically substituted part of the molecule, likely a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **δ 28.4, 21.3:** These signals are in the aliphatic region and correspond to methyl (CH₃) carbons.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n*   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and 6.75 (1H, d):** These two signals, each a doublet for one proton, are characteristic of two adjacent protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons). The coupling between them causes the splitting into doublets.\n*   **δ 2.31 (3H, s) and 2.28 (3H, s):** These two singlets, each integrating to three protons, indicate the presence of two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons.\n\n**Assembling the Product's Structure:**\nBased on the combined spectral data, we can deduce the following structural features for the product:\n1.  A ketone group (-CO-).\n2.  A para-substituted benzene ring.\n3.  A `–CH=CH–` group (a disubstituted alkene).\n4.  Two methyl (–CH₃) groups.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the most logical structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This structure is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the spectra:\n*   **p-Tolyl group:** This accounts for the para-substituted ring and one of the methyl singlets (e.g., at 2.31 ppm). The aromatic protons would appear as two doublets at ~7.08 and ~7.71 ppm.\n*   **But-3-en-2-one chain:** This accounts for the ketone, the second methyl singlet (the acetyl methyl, -COCH₃, at ~2.28 ppm), and the two vinylic protons (at 6.75 and 7.68 ppm). Actual reported spectral data for this compound confirms these assignments. For instance, a published spectrum reports signals at δ 7.48 (d, 1H, vinyl), 7.43 (d, 2H, Ar-H), 7.19 (d, 2H, Ar-H), 6.66 (d, 1H, vinyl), and 2.36 (s, 6H, two methyls). While the exact shifts differ slightly from the problem statement, the pattern is identical.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Reaction and Identify Compound X\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O), an epoxide, with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, to yield 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is a base-catalyzed isomerization or rearrangement of an epoxide.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound contains a *phenyl* group (from \"styryl\"), not the *p-tolyl* group required to form the identified product.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This compound has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and contains a *p-tolyl* group (from \"4-methylstyryl\"). Its structure is `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This type of vinyl-substituted epoxide is known to rearrange to an α,β-unsaturated ketone under basic or thermal conditions. The reaction is a known transformation called a DABCO-mediated Meinwald rearrangement, which for vinylogous terminal epoxides like this yields the corresponding unsaturated methyl ketone.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The formula for this compound is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a *phenyl* group, not a *p-tolyl* group, and would lead to a different product upon rearrangement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the product of the reaction is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material among the options that contains the necessary p-tolyl group and can rearrange to form this specific product is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
