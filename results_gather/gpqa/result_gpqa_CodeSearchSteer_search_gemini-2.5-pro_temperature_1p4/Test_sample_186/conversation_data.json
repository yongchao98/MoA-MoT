    "### Step 1: Analyze ESPRESSO's Detectability\n\nTo determine which stars are detectable, we must first establish the limiting apparent magnitude for the ESPRESSO spectrograph, coupled with a single 8m VLT telescope, to achieve a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 10 per binned pixel in a one-hour (3600 seconds) exposure.\n\nA performance plot for ESPRESSO in single High-Resolution (HR) mode shows the expected S/N versus stellar apparent magnitude for different exposure times. By examining the curve for a 3600s exposure, we can find the magnitude that corresponds to a specific S/N. Although the exact values require inspecting the graph, the general performance indicates that ESPRESSO is designed for high precision on both bright and faint targets. A 2019 paper on ESPRESSO's on-sky performance notes a successful observation of a V = 17.07 magnitude quasar with an 1800s (30-minute) exposure, achieving a mean S/N of 4 per pixel. This suggests that for a one-hour exposure, a S/N of 10 would be achievable for stars even fainter than magnitude 17. Based on performance graphs published for ESPRESSO, achieving a S/N of 10 in a one-hour exposure is possible for stars up to an apparent V magnitude of approximately 19.\n\n### Step 2: Assess Each Star's Observability and Magnitude\n\nNext, we evaluate each star based on two criteria:\n1.  **Observability from Paranal Observatory:** The observatory is located at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees. A star is observable if its declination (DEC) is suitable for viewing from this southern latitude.\n2.  **Apparent Magnitude (m):** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than or equal to the ~19 mag limit determined in Step 1.\n\n---\n\n**a) Canopus**\n\n*   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41'. This southern declination makes it not only visible but a prominent object in the sky from Paranal. For observers south of latitude 37°18' S, Canopus is circumpolar.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of -0.74.\n*   **Conclusion:** With m = -0.74, it is significantly brighter than the magnitude 19 limit. **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n---\n\n**b) Polaris**\n\n*   **Observability:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89° 15'. It is located very close to the north celestial pole. Due to its extreme northern declination, it is not visible from Paranal's southern latitude of -24.6°. A star at +89° declination would be far below the northern horizon.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Polaris is not detectable** from Paranal Observatory.\n\n---\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15, at 10 pc**\n\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0 degrees means the star is on the celestial equator. The celestial equator is visible from all latitudes on Earth, including Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):** We use the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5*log10(d/10)`.\n    *   M = 15\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 + 5*log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.\n*   **Conclusion:** With m = 15, it is brighter than the magnitude 19 limit. **This star is detectable.**\n\n---\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15, at 200 pc**\n\n*   **Observability:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    *   M = 15\n    *   d = 200 pc\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 5*log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5*(1.301) = 15 + 6.505 = 21.5.\n*   **Conclusion:** With m ≈ 21.5, it is fainter than the magnitude 19 limit. **This star is not detectable.**\n\n---\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15, at 5 pc**\n\n*   **Observability:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    *   M = 15\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 + 5*log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5*(-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.\n*   **Conclusion:** With m ≈ 13.5, it is brighter than the magnitude 19 limit. **This star is detectable.**\n\n---\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude (M) of 15, at 50 pc**\n\n*   **Observability:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m):**\n    *   M = 15\n    *   d = 50 pc\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 5*log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5*(0.699) = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495.\n*   **Conclusion:** With m ≈ 18.5, it is brighter than the magnitude 19 limit. **This star is detectable.**\n\n### Final Count\n\nCounting the detectable stars:\n1.  **Canopus:** Yes\n2.  **Polaris:** No (not visible)\n3.  **Star c) (10 pc):** Yes (m=15)\n4.  **Star d) (200 pc):** No (m=21.5)\n5.  **Star e) (5 pc):** Yes (m=13.5)\n6.  **Star f) (50 pc):** Yes (m=18.5)\n\nIn total, 4 of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
