    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct factor.\n\n### 1. The Stefan-Boltzmann Law\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The relationship is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n*L = 4πR²σT⁴*\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n### 2. Luminosity Ratio\nTo find how many times greater the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) is than that of Star_2 (L₂), we can set up a ratio:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)*\n\nThe constants cancel out, leaving:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴*\n\nWe are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Plugging this in gives:\n*L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴*\n\n### 3. Temperature Ratio via Wien's Law and Doppler Shift\nThe problem states that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength (λ_max). This observed peak wavelength is related to the star's surface temperature by Wien's Displacement Law (λ_emitted = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant). However, we must account for the relativistic Doppler effect, as Star_2 is moving at a significant radial velocity.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** With a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength.\n    *λ_obs₁ = λ_emitted₁ = b/T₁*\n\n*   **For Star_2:** With a radial velocity (v) of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the relativistic Doppler shift formula.\n    *λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n    Substituting Wien's law:\n    *λ_obs₂ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n\nSince the observed wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂):\n*b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]*\n\nSolving for the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂):\n*T₁/T₂ = √[(1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)]*\n\n### 4. Calculation\nNow we can calculate the numerical values. The velocity of Star_2 is v = 700 km/s, and the speed of light is c ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n*   β = v/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nSubstitute this value back into the temperature ratio equation:\n*(T₁/T₂)⁴ = (√[(1 - β) / (1 + β)])⁴ = [(1 - β) / (1 + β)]²*\n\nFinally, substitute this into our luminosity ratio equation:\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333)]²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [0.997667 / 1.002333]²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.995345)²*\n*L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99071*\n*L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291*\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
