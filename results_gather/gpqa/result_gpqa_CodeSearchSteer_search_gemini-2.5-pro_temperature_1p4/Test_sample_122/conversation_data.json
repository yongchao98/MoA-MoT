    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (frame S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the relevant physics formulas:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time `Δt` in the stationary frame S is longer than the proper time `Δt'` in the moving frame S'. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n    *   `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculations:**\n\n    *   **First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n    *   **Then, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame `Δt`:**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n    *   **Finally, calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n    Alternatively, we can combine the formulas first:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option B. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
