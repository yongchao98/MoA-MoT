    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect black body, heated only by its parent star. For a planet in a circular orbit, its equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star. Since the albedo (the fraction of light reflected by the planet) is the same for both planets, this factor cancels out when calculating the ratio. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nWhere 'a' is the semi-major axis, or the orbital radius for a circular orbit.\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is therefore:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = √(a_2 / a_4)\n\n### **Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be written as:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFrom this, we can establish a relationship for the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n### **Calculation**\n\nWe can use the relationship from Kepler's Third Law to express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods:\n\na_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\nP_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nNow, we substitute this value back into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na_2 / a_4 = (2 / 3.5)^(2/3)\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the equation for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = √((2 / 3.5)^(2/3))\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ 0.83\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
