    "### Breakdown of Theories at High Energies\n\nTo determine which of the listed physical theories does not require regularization at high energies, a process necessary to handle infinities that arise in calculations, we must examine the fundamental nature of each.\n\n**Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**, the quantum theory of light and matter, is known to produce infinite results in calculations for high-energy interactions. These infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, necessitate a procedure called regularization to make the theory predictive.\n\nSimilarly, **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**, the theory of the strong nuclear force, also encounters UV divergences in its calculations. Perturbative calculations in QCD often involve loop diagrams that diverge at high momenta, requiring regularization and renormalization to yield finite, physical results.\n\n**Classical Electrodynamics**, while not a quantum theory, faces its own problems with infinities. The self-energy of a point-like charge, for instance, is infinite. To resolve these singularities, which occur at small distance scales (and thus are related to high energy), some form of regularization is required, such as assuming the charge is not a perfect point. This issue is conceptually inherited in some quantum theories.\n\nIn contrast, **Superstring Theory** is widely believed to be free from such ultraviolet divergences. This theory avoids the high-energy infinities that plague quantum field theories because it replaces point-like particles with one-dimensional strings. This fundamental change smooths out interactions at very short distances, effectively eliminating the source of UV divergences. While the theory does contend with infrared divergences (related to long-distance effects), it does not require regularization to handle infinities at high energies.\n\n<<<C>>>"
