  "question": "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound.

    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound by genetic mutation, the most effective approach is to completely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most reliably achieved through mutations that cause a major alteration of the resulting protein, such as a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\nLet's analyze the provided mutations:\n\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT... -> Translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT... -> Translates to: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is a missense mutation where Leucine is replaced by Tyrosine. A single amino acid change might not eliminate the protein's function.\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT... -> Translates to: Met - Phe - STOP.\n    *   This is a nonsense mutation. The codon `TAA` is a stop codon, which signals the end of protein synthesis. The introduction of a premature stop codon results in a severely shortened, and almost certainly non-functional, protein. This type of mutation is highly likely to eliminate the protein's activity.\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   If interpreted as an insertion of a 'T' after the second codon (`ATG TTT T ACG...`), this creates a frameshift mutation. A frameshift alters the entire downstream amino acid sequence and often creates a premature stop codon, leading to a non-functional protein. While effective, a nonsense mutation is a more direct route to a truncated protein.\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   This appears to be a missense mutation where Leucine (`CTC`) is changed to Tyrosine (`TAC`). Similar to Mutant 1, this single amino acid substitution is less likely to completely eliminate the protein function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This truncation is the most definitive way among the choices to ensure the resulting protein is non-functional, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
