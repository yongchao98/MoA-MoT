    "To determine the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space, we need to find its corresponding Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz).\n\nThe given density matrix is:\nρ = ½ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)\n\nIn matrix form, |0⟩ is the vectorᵀ and |1⟩ is the vectorᵀ.\nTherefore:\n*   |0⟩⟨0| = [,]\n*   |1⟩⟨1| = [,]\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for ρ:\nρ = ½ ( [,] + [,] ) = ½ [,] = [[½, 0], [0, ½]]\n\nThis is the density matrix for a maximally mixed state.\n\nAny single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) and the identity matrix (I) using the Bloch vector **r** = (rx, ry, rz):\nρ = ½ (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**) = ½ (I + rx*σx + ry*σy + rz*σz)\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula:\nri = Tr(ρσi), where i can be x, y, or z.\n\nLet's calculate the components:\n*   **rx = Tr(ρσx):**\n    ρσx = [[½, 0], [0, ½]] * [,] = [[0, ½], [½, 0]]\n    Tr(ρσx) = 0 + 0 = 0\n\n*   **ry = Tr(ρσy):**\n    ρσy = [[½, 0], [0, ½]] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0, -i/2], [i/2, 0]]\n    Tr(ρσy) = 0 + 0 = 0\n\n*   **rz = Tr(ρσz):**\n    ρσz = [[½, 0], [0, ½]] * [, [0, -1]] = [[½, 0], [0, -½]]\n    Tr(ρσz) = ½ - ½ = 0\n\nThe resulting Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\nGeometrically, the space of all possible qubit states is represented by the Bloch ball, a unit ball in three-dimensional space. Pure states lie on the surface of the sphere (where the length of the Bloch vector is 1), while mixed states are in the interior (length < 1). The maximally mixed state, represented by the density matrix ρ = I/2, corresponds to a Bloch vector of **r** = (0, 0, 0), which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nTherefore, the geometrical position of the given density matrix is the origin of the qubit space.\n\n<<<C>>>"
