    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions involves a cascade through an intermediate state. To determine the correct path and its probability, we must consider the electric dipole selection rules and the branching ratios of the transitions.\n\n### 1. Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers |n,l,m>:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1.\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number *n* can change by any integer value, but for decay (spontaneous emission), it must decrease (Δn < 0).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Transition Path\n\nThe atom starts in the initial state |3,0,0> (also known as the 3s state) and ends in the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s ground state). The transition must occur in two steps.\n\n*   **First Transition: |3,0,0> → Intermediate State |n',l',m'>**\n    *   Initial state: l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the Δl = ±1 rule, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   Applying the Δm = 0, ±1 rule, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   Since it is a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease. The most probable decay is to the nearest lower energy level, so the intermediate state will have n'=2.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are the 2p-orbitals: **|2,1,0>**, **|2,1,1>**, and **|2,1,-1>**.\n\n*   **Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   Final state: l=0, m=0.\n    *   Let's check the transitions from the possible intermediate states:\n        *   From **|2,1,0>**: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 and Δm = 0 - 0 = 0. This is an allowed transition.\n        *   From **|2,1,1>**: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 and Δm = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed transition.\n        *   From **|2,1,-1>**: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 and Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1. This is an allowed transition.\n\nAll three decay routes through the |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> states are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe overall probability of a specific decay route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step (|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>):**\n    The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the three degenerate |2,1,m'> states. The total probability of transitioning from 3s to any of the 2p states is divided equally among the m' sublevels.\n    *   Total probability to decay from 3s to 2p is 1 (ignoring other much less probable decay channels like direct two-photon emission to 1s).\n    *   The probability of transitioning to |2,1,0> is 1/3.\n    *   The probability of transitioning to |2,1,1> is 1/3.\n    *   The probability of transitioning to |2,1,-1> is 1/3.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step (|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the 2p states (|2,1,m'>), the only allowed dipole decay path to a lower energy level is to the 1s state (|1,0,0>). A transition from 2p to 2s is forbidden by the Δl=±1 rule. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a Specific Route:**\n    The total probability for the cascade |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (**Correct**)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct transition route and corresponding probability is the one described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
