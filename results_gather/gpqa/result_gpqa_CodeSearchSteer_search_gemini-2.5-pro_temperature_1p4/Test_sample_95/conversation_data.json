    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, a multi-step calculation is required, involving fundamental principles of physics and astronomy.\n\n### 1. Determining the Size of the Event Horizon\n\nFirst, we find the diameter of the black hole's event horizon. The angular size (θ), the actual size (D), and the distance (d) to an object are related by the small-angle formula. For small angles, the diameter D is approximately the angular size in radians multiplied by the distance.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Angular size (θ) = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees\n*   Distance (d) = 10¹⁰ parsecs\n\n**Unit Conversions:**\n*   The distance needs to be converted from parsecs to meters. One parsec is approximately 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n    *   d = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m\n*   The angular size must be converted from degrees to radians. One degree is π/180 radians.\n    *   θ_rad = 10⁻¹⁷ deg * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians\n\n**Calculation of the Schwarzschild Radius (R_s):**\nThe angular size corresponds to the diameter (2R_s) of the event horizon.\n*   θ_rad = (2 * R_s) / d\n*   R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2\n*   R_s = (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ rad * 3.086 x 10²⁶ m) / 2\n*   R_s ≈ 2.69 x 10⁷ m\n\n### 2. Calculating the Area of the Event Horizon\n\nThe event horizon of a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole is a sphere with a radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius. The area (A) of this sphere is given by the formula A = 4πR_s².\n\n*   A = 4 * π * (2.69 x 10⁷ m)²\n*   A ≈ 4 * π * (7.236 x 10¹⁴ m²)\n*   A ≈ 9.09 x 10¹⁵ m²\n\n### 3. Calculating the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy\n\nThe entropy of a black hole, known as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, is proportional to the area of its event horizon. The formula is:\n\nS = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p²)\n\nWhere:\n*   S is the entropy.\n*   k_B is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   A is the area of the event horizon.\n*   l_p is the Planck length (≈ 1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m).\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   l_p² ≈ (1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m)² ≈ 2.611 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²\n*   S = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K * 9.09 x 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * 2.611 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\n*   S ≈ (1.254 x 10⁻⁷ J m²/K) / (1.0444 x 10⁻⁶⁹ m²)\n*   S ≈ 1.20 x 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe calculated order of magnitude for the entropy of the black hole is 10⁶², which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
