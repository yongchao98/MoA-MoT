    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes, we must apply the Boltzmann equation. This equation describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system that is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), as is assumed for the stellar photosphere.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher energy level (level 2) and lower energy level (level 1), respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of these levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem provides the temperatures of the star with and without spots, as well as the wavelength of the transition between the two energy levels. The information about the star's radius and mass is not required for this specific calculation.\n\n**1. Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):**\nThe energy difference between the two levels can be calculated from the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å) using the formula for the energy of a photon:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere *h* is Planck's constant and *c* is the speed of light. A convenient formula for this calculation is:\n\nΔE (in eV) ≈ 12400 / λ (in Å)\n\nPlugging in the given wavelength:\nΔE ≈ 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n**2. Set up the ratio for both temperature conditions:**\nLet's denote the ratio (N₂/N₁) without spots as R_nospots (at T_nospots = 6000 K) and with spots as R_spots (at T_spots = 5500 K).\n\nR_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\nR_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n**3. Determine the factor of change:**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio of R_nospots to R_spots.\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\nWhen we divide the two expressions, the term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\nUsing the properties of exponents, this simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]\n\n**4. Calculate the final factor:**\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\nFactor = exp[ (8.5635 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99379 * ((6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000)) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99379 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99379 / 66000 ]\nFactor = exp(1.5057)\nFactor ≈ 4.507\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when 40% of its surface is covered by spots.\n\n<<<A>>>"
