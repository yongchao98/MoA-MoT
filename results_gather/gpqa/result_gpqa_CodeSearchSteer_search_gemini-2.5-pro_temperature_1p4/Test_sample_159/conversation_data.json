    "The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in a far-field diffraction pattern. The aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and the number of sides, N, is infinitely large.\n\nFirst, we must determine the shape of the aperture as N approaches infinity. A regular N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) will approach a circle. As N becomes infinitely large, the distance from the center to any point on the polygon's perimeter becomes equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the aperture is effectively a circle of radius 'a'.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The intensity of this pattern is described using Bessel functions.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is given by:\n\nsin(θ) = c * (λ / D)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the diameter of the circular aperture, and 'c' is a constant determined by the zeros of the Bessel function. In our case, the radius of the aperture is 'a', so the diameter D = 2a.\n\nThe equation for the minima becomes:\n\nsin(θ) = (x / π) * (λ / D) = (x / π) * (λ / 2a)\n\nwhere 'x' represents the zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function. The first few zeros are approximately x₁ = 3.8317 and x₂ = 7.0156.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is found using the first zero of J₁(x):\nθ₁ = (3.8317 / π) * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is found using the second zero of J₁(x):\nθ₂ = (7.0156 / π) * (λ / 2a) ≈ 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a).\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.115 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis value is very close to 0.506 λ / a. A more precise calculation using more significant figures for the Bessel function zeros (x₁ ≈ 3.83171, x₂ ≈ 7.01559) gives:\n\nθ₁ ≈ (3.83171 / (2π)) * λ / a ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\nθ₂ ≈ (7.01559 / (2π)) * λ / a ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\nΔθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
