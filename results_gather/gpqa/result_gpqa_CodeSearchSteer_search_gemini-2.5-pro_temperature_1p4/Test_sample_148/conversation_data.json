    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and how they lead to the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Â¹H NMR Data**: The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct for one proton (1H). This immediately suggests the presence of two very similar, but not identical, chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the difference must arise from the local chemical environment.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data**: The analysis shows two separate peaks that can be resolved chromatographically. Critically, both peaks give the *same mass spectrum*, which matches the expected mass of the target peptide. This confirms that the two species are isomers (same molecular formula and mass) and not a precursor or an unrelated impurity, which would almost certainly have a different mass.\n\nBased on this evidence, let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is unlikely. A precursor from the synthesis would have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. The data shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the most plausible explanation.\n    *   **Formation:** During chemical peptide synthesis, the activated amino acid is susceptible to a side reaction called epimerization (or racemization) at its alpha-carbon. This means that if an L-amino acid was used, some of it could be converted to the D-amino acid. If this happens to an amino acid being added to a peptide that already contains another chiral center, the result is a pair of diastereomers (e.g., L-L and L-D peptides).\n    *   **NMR:** Diastereomers are different chemical compounds and are not mirror images. Therefore, their corresponding protons exist in different chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. Protons on a chiral center or adjacent to one are particularly sensitive to this effect. It is common for diastereomers to show duplicate peaks for corresponding protons.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because diastereomers have different physical properties, they can often be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. Since they are isomers, they have the same mass, which is consistent with the LC-MS data. The fact that they are resolved into two peaks confirms they are distinct, separable compounds.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers are mirror images and have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They would produce a single peak in a standard NMR spectrum and co-elute (appear as a single peak) on a standard (achiral) LC column. Distinguishing them requires a chiral environment, such as a chiral solvent, a chiral shift reagent for NMR, or a chiral LC column, none of which are specified.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a vague term, but any interpretation where an extra molecule is added (e.g., another amino acid or coupling reagent) would result in a product with a significantly different mass. This is contradicted by the MS data showing both species have the expected mass.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two separable isomers with the same mass, which also give rise to two distinct signals for an alpha-proton in the NMR, is a classic sign of diastereomer formation. This is a known side reaction in peptide synthesis caused by epimerization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
