    "To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to a star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n    This means that a star with a smaller parallax is farther away, and a star with a larger parallax is closer.\n\n2.  **Use the given information about star counts and parallax.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to distance.**\n    By substituting the relationship from step 1 into the expression from step 2, we can find how the total number of stars up to a certain distance `r` depends on that distance.\n    Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    This indicates that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\n    The question asks how the number of stars *changes with distance*, which implies finding the number of stars per unit distance range. This is equivalent to finding the rate of change of N with respect to r, which is the derivative of N with respect to r (`dN/dr`).\n\n    If we have a proportionality `N ∝ r^5`, we can write it as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n    `N = k * r^5`\n\n    Now, we differentiate `N` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n\n    This result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as `~ r^4`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
