    "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**, denoted as ∫∇⋅**f** dV, over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field is described as falling off radially as 1/r², with a non-zero component only in the radial direction. This can be written as:\n**f**(**r**) = (1/r²) **r̂**\nwhere **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThere are two primary methods to solve this integral:\n\n**Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nThe formula for the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is:\n∇⋅**f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² f_r)/∂r + ... (terms for θ and φ components, which are zero in this case)\n\nHere, the radial component f_r is 1/r². Substituting this in:\n∇⋅**f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nThis calculation shows the divergence is zero for all r ≠ 0. However, at the origin (r=0), the field **f** is singular (undefined), and therefore the divergence is also undefined. A naive conclusion that the integral is zero because the divergence is zero almost everywhere would be incorrect, as the behavior at the singularity must be accounted for. In fact, the divergence of this specific field at the origin is best described by the Dirac delta function: ∇⋅(**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ(**r**).\n\nIntegrating this over the volume of the sphere:\n∫_V (∇⋅**f**) dV = ∫_V 4πδ(**r**) dV = 4π ∫_V δ(**r**) dV\n\nBy the definition of the Dirac delta function, the integral over any volume containing the origin is 1. Therefore:\n∫_V (∇⋅**f**) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π.\n\n**Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface enclosing that volume:\n∫_V (∇⋅**f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nAlthough the theorem requires the vector field to be continuously differentiable throughout the volume, which is violated by the singularity at r=0, we can still apply it by understanding that the flux integral calculates the total \"source\" strength inside the volume.\n\nThe surface S is the sphere of radius R.\n*   The vector field on the surface of the sphere is **f** = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n*   The differential surface area element is d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**. The direction is the outward normal, which is the radial direction **r̂**.\n\nNow we calculate the dot product **f** ⋅ d**S**:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]\n\nSince **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the R² terms cancel out, leaving:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\nNow we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere:\n∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to θ:\n∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNext, integrate with respect to φ:\n∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2(2π) = 4π.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π. This value is independent of the radius R of the sphere, as long as it encloses the origin.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 4 π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<C>>>"
