    "### Analysis of Spectral Data:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at **m/z = 156**.\n    *   There is a significant peak at **m/z = 158** (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32%, which is approximately one-third the intensity of the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of roughly 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   All the proposed options (A, B, C, and D) are isomers with the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The calculated molecular weight using the most common isotopes (³⁵Cl) is approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is observed. This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak is present at 1720 cm⁻¹**. This is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, and its position is typical for a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly suggests the functional group is a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This evidence supports options A and C and makes B (an aldehyde with a phenol) and D (a chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) highly unlikely.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A singlet (s) at **11.0 ppm** representing one proton (1H) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. Its high chemical shift is due to deshielding and hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The signals at **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)** are in the aromatic region.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. This pattern arises because the protons on the ring are split only by their adjacent neighbors, creating two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   *Option A (2-chlorobenzoic acid)* is *ortho*-substituted and would show a more complex pattern with four distinct signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   *Option C (4-chlorobenzoic acid)* is *para*-substituted, which perfectly matches the observed 2H doublet and 2H doublet pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined spectral evidence: the MS confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The only compound that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
