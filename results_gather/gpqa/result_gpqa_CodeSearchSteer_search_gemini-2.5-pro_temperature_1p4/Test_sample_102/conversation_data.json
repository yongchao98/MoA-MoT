    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents (-COCH₃, -Br, -NO₂) and the conditions under which each reaction can occur.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nA critical consideration is the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction (adding the -COCH₃ group), which does not proceed on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group (-NO₂), or on rings with an amino group (-NH₂) due to the Lewis acid catalyst reacting with the basic amine.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Bromination of benzene** yields bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **Nitration of bromobenzene** would yield a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitrobromobenzene, not the required *meta* relationship.\n3.  Furthermore, **Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii)** on nitrobromobenzene would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene (i)** gives acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step for achieving a *meta* substitution pattern.\n2.  **Bromination of acetophenone (ii)** will be directed to the *meta* position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. Now, the acetyl and bromo groups are in the correct 1,3 relationship.\n3.  **Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone (iii)** is the next step. The ring has two substituents: the acetyl group at C1 (a *meta*-director) and the bromo group at C3 (an *ortho, para*-director). The acetyl group strongly directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. The strong meta-directing effect of the acetyl group controls the regioselectivity, leading to the formation of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, the desired product. This three-step sequence is a valid synthesis. While the subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical in this context, the initial sequence successfully produces the target compound.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  Steps (i) through (iv) nitrate benzene and then subsequently remove the nitro group, returning to benzene. This is a redundant loop.\n2.  If we consider the later steps, step (vi), a **Friedel-Crafts acylation**, is proposed after bromination (v). This would produce primarily *p*-bromoacetophenone. Nitrating this compound (vii) would not lead to the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Nitration of benzene (i)** gives nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Reduction of nitrobenzene (ii)** gives aniline.\n3.  **Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline (iii)** fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option B presents a chemically viable pathway to synthesize the target molecule in its first three steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects or proposing reactions under conditions where they would not work.\n\n<<<B>>>"
