    "The key to determining the number of loops in the Feynman diagram lies in the `1/(4pi)^6` factor from your colleague's note.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations in four-dimensional spacetime, each closed loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of `1/(4Ï€)^2` to the overall expression for the diagram's value. This factor arises from the integration over the momentum of the virtual particle within the loop.\n\nThe scribbled expression contains a factor of `1/(4pi)^6`. This can be rewritten as `(1/(4pi)^2)^3`. Based on the standard convention, this indicates the presence of three such loops.\n\nThe other elements in the expression are consistent with a three-loop diagram:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are the coupling constants of the theory. Their powers relate to the number of vertices in the diagram, and a total power of five is plausible for a complex, three-loop interaction.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors that can arise from symmetries of the diagram or from mathematical operations like taking a trace.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This ratio of energy scales is a typical result of the regularization process used to handle the infinities that arise in loop calculations.\n\nTherefore, the diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
