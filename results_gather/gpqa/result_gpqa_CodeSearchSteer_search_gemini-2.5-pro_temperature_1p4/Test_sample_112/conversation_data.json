    "Here is a step-by-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. When observed with a very broad O-H stretch, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation from the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. The mass-to-charge ratio of 45 corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group fragment (-COOH):\n    *   Carbon (C): 12 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu\n    *   **Total = 45 amu**\n*   The presence of this fragment is highly indicative of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The evidence points to at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carbonyl group and one for the C=C in the alkene.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the proposed formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This is a match.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which contradicts the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygens.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic data provides a consistent picture:\n*   The molecule is a carboxylic acid (FTIR, Mass Spec). This requires the formula to have two oxygen atoms.\n*   The molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond (FTIR, ¹H NMR).\n*   The molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the C=O and C=C bonds.\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all these conditions: it has two oxygens, and it has two degrees of unsaturation, accommodating a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
