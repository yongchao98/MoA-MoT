    "To identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound, a step-by-step analysis of its molecular structure is necessary.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** With a total of 8 carbon atoms, the two substituents must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum confirms a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:** A carbonyl group requires one carbon. To make a total of 8 carbons, the substituent containing the carbonyl must also contain the second carbon. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This accounts for both the carbonyl and the two extra carbons. Therefore, the substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The resulting compound is a haloacetophenone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\nThe two substituents can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions on the benzene ring. The ¹H NMR data provided, particularly the splitting patterns of the aromatic protons, allows for the determination of this arrangement.\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-substitution:** These would result in more complex splitting patterns for the four aromatic protons, typically seen as multiple signals or multiplets.\n*   **Para-substitution:** A para-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents, such as in 4-haloacetophenone, possesses a high degree of symmetry. This symmetry results in two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Each set consists of two chemically equivalent protons, leading to a characteristic pattern of two doublets, with each doublet integrating to 2H.\n\n**3. Evaluate the ¹H NMR Options:**\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The two doublets (`d`) at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to two protons (`2H`), are highly characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The singlet (`s`) at 2.3 ppm, integrating to three protons (`3H`), is consistent with the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH₃). Protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl are typically found in the 2.0-3.0 ppm range.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks the 3H singlet required for the acetyl group's methyl protons. The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are outside the typical aromatic region (>6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   While there is a 3H singlet, its chemical shift of 1.3 ppm is too low for a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl. The other signals are not in the aromatic proton range.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is indicative of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone as expected from an acetyl group. It also lacks the required 3H singlet for the methyl group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the data in option A is the only one that correctly represents a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen, specifically a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
