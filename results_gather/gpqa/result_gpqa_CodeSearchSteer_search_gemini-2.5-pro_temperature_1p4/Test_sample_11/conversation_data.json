    "Based on the law of conservation of energy and momentum, the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺) into a muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) can be calculated. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\nE_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino\n139.6 MeV = (KE_muon + m_muon * c²) + E_neutrino\n139.6 MeV = KE_muon + 105.7 MeV + KE_neutrino\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the products is:\nKE_muon + KE_neutrino = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.\n|p_muon| = |p_neutrino| = p\n\n**Calculation:**\nBy solving the relativistic energy-momentum equations for both particles, we can find their individual kinetic energies.\n1.  The energy of the massless neutrino is `E_neutrino = p * c`.\n2.  The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its total energy, `KE_neutrino = p * c`.\n3.  The energy of the muon is given by `E_muon² = (p * c)² + (m_muon * c²)²`.\n\nThe momentum of the decay products is calculated to be approximately 29.8 MeV/c. This gives the kinetic energy of the neutrino:\nKE_neutrino = p * c ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is then found by subtracting the neutrino's energy from the total kinetic energy released:\nKE_muon = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV ≈ 4.1 MeV\n\nMultiple physics resources confirm that for this decay, the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.12 MeV or 4.13 MeV. The remaining energy is carried away by the neutrino.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
