    "To determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance, we need to calculate its lifetime in the laboratory frame and its velocity.\n\n### Key Concepts and Formulas:\n\n1.  **Mean Lifetime (τ):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is inversely related to its decay width (Γ). The formula is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The relation is:\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** Because the particle is moving at a high velocity, its lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame (τ') is longer than its proper lifetime (τ) due to time dilation.\n    τ' = γ * τ\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (mc²).\n    γ = E / mc²\n\n4.  **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame during its dilated lifetime.\n    L = v * τ' = v * γ * τ\n    where v is the particle's velocity.\n\nA more direct formula combines these steps, relating the decay distance to the particle's momentum (p), mass (m), and decay width (Γ):\nL = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)\n\n### Given Values:\n*   Total Energy (E_X) = 8 GeV\n*   Mass (m_X) = 1.2 GeV/c²\n*   Decay Width (Γ_X) = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the relativistic momentum (pc) of the particle.**\n    The relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    (pc)² = E_X² - (m_X c²)²\n    (pc)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)² = 64 GeV² - 1.44 GeV² = 62.56 GeV²\n    pc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.9095 GeV\n\n2.  **Use the value of ħc (hbar-c).**\n    A commonly used value for ħc in particle physics is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm, which translates to 1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m.\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n    Using the derived formula:\n    L = (pc / (m_X c² * Γ_X)) * ħc\n    L = (7.9095 GeV / (1.2 GeV * 0.320 GeV)) * (1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m)\n    L = (7.9095 / 0.384) * (1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ m)\n    L = 20.5977 * (1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ m)\n    L ≈ 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n*   B) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n*   C) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n*   D) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value of 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m is extremely close to option C. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the constants used in setting the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"
