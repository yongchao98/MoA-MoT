    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under several key assumptions about the semiconductor device and the nature of charge transport. Based on an analysis of these assumptions, the correct statement can be identified.\n\nThe primary conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). This is a foundational aspect of the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) theory.\n*   **Trap-Free Solid:** The standard Mott-Gurney equation applies to an idealized semiconductor with no trap states within the band gap that could immobilize charge carriers. The presence of traps would alter the current-voltage relationship, leading to what is known as trap-limited SCLC.\n*   **Ohmic Contact:** The charge-injecting contact must be Ohmic, meaning it forms no energetic barrier to the injection of carriers. This ensures that the contact can supply an abundance of carriers, so the current is limited by the transport properties of the bulk material (the \"space charge\") rather than by the injection process itself. A Schottky contact, which has a barrier, would violate this condition.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The derivation of the equation assumes that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of carriers due to concentration gradients is considered negligible.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n*   A is incorrect because a Schottky contact is a barrier to injection, which contradicts the requirements for SCLC.\n*   B is incorrect because it states that the *drift* current is negligible. In reality, the drift current is the dominant mechanism, while the *diffusion* current is assumed to be negligible.\n*   D is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is specifically for single-carrier (unipolar) devices, not two-carrier (bipolar) devices.\n*   C accurately summarizes the main requirements: it is a trap-free, single-carrier device with a non-barrier contact (Ohmic) where diffusion current is negligible.\n\n<<<C>>>"
