    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240 °C).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Given the reagents (strong base, heat) and the spectral data of the product, this is not a simple substitution or elimination reaction. The adamantane cage is prone to rearrangement under these conditions. The presence of a characteristic infrared (IR) absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates the formation of a saturated ketone. The molecular formula of the product can be deduced to be C₁₀H₁₄O, as 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ and the reaction involves a rearrangement where the two bromine atoms are replaced by one oxygen atom.\n*   A known rearrangement of adamantane derivatives under these conditions leads to a protoadamantane skeleton. The most plausible structure for Product 1 is **protoadamantan-4-one** (also known as tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). While the provided ¹H NMR data for product 1 is unusual (particularly the 4.79 ppm signal), the overall reaction sequence is most consistent with this ketone structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide and heat.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. However, the subsequent reaction step is ozonolysis, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond. This implies that the alcohol formed from the reduction undergoes dehydration under the reaction conditions (Lewis acidic Al(O-iPr)₃ and heat) to form an alkene.\n    *   **Reduction:** Protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol.\n    *   **Dehydration:** Protoadamantan-4-ol is then dehydrated to form an alkene. Elimination of water will form a double bond adjacent to the carbon that held the hydroxyl group. This results in the formation of **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This is Product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Ozone (O₃) at -78 °C, followed by 2) dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond and converts the two alkene carbons into carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n    *   Cleavage of the C4=C5 double bond in protoadamant-4-ene opens one of the rings in the tricyclic system.\n    *   The resulting product is a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound: **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde-7-one**. This is Product 3.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde-7-one. This molecule contains a ketone group at position 7 and an aldehyde group at position 3.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** In a molecule containing alkyl, ketone, and aldehyde functionalities, the **aldehydic proton (-CHO)** is by far the most deshielded (typically δ = 9-10 ppm), excluding any acidic protons that would exchange with a deuterated solvent.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of this aldehydic proton.\n    1.  **Vicinal Coupling (³J):** The aldehyde group is attached to carbon C3 of the bicyclic ring. C3 is a methine group (it is bonded to one hydrogen, H3). The aldehydic proton will couple with this single vicinal proton (H3). According to the n+1 rule, this coupling will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** In rigid bicyclic systems, long-range coupling across four bonds can be significant, particularly if the bonds form a \"W\" or \"M\" shape. The aldehydic proton is four bonds away from the protons on C2 and C4. Due to the symmetry of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system (looking from C3), the two axial protons on C2 and C4 are chemically equivalent. In the preferred conformation of the molecule, the aldehydic proton and the two axial protons on C2 and C4 are often arranged in a \"W\" configuration. This leads to a significant ⁴J coupling. The coupling to these two equivalent protons will split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n*   **Combined Pattern:** The signal for the aldehyde proton is first split into a doublet by the H3 proton, and each line of that doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent axial protons on C2 and C4. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
