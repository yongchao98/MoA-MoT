    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M₁/M₂). The mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from the orbital period and the radial velocities of the two stars.\n\n### Key Principles\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) by the following formula:\n\nM = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   **M** is the total mass of the system.\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that the inclination angle *i* is very close to 90 degrees. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\n### System Data\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁a, K₁b): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Total Velocity Amplitude (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂a, K₂b): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Total Velocity Amplitude (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the masses of the two systems. The constant term (2πG) will cancel out, as will the sin³(i) term, since we assume it's 1 for both eclipsing systems.\n\nThe ratio of the masses is therefore:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the equation:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³\n\nSimplify the fraction (15/25) to (3/5):\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
