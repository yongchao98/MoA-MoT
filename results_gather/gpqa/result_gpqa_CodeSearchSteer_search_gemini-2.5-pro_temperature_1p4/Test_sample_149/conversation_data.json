    "### Analysis of the Reaction Steps Leads to the Final Product\n\nBased on the provided molecular formula and NMR data, the reaction sequence unfolds in three distinct stages to yield the final product.\n\n**1. Identifying the Starting Compound**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the degree of unsaturation is calculated to be five. The 1H-NMR data provides the key to the structure:\n*   A signal at **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)** is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to an adjacent group with two protons.\n*   Two doublets at **6.98 ppm (d, 2H)** and **6.51 ppm (d, 2H)** are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   A broad singlet at **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)** suggests a primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   A doublet at **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)** corresponds to a -CH2- group coupled to a single proton, which is the aldehyde proton.\n\nCombining these fragments, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The benzene ring and the aldehyde group account for the five degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**2. Transformation via Diazotization and Hydrolysis**\n\nThe first two steps of the reaction involve the conversion of the primary aromatic amine.\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for diazotization, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). This reaction is specific to aromatic amines and must be carried out at low temperatures. The intermediate formed is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   **Step 2: H2O, Heat:** The addition of water and heat to the diazonium salt results in hydrolysis, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This step produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**3. Aldol Condensation to Form the Final Product**\n\nThe third step uses aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) and heat, which are classic conditions for an aldol condensation.\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-protons (on the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde). The strong base (KOH) deprotonates one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe self-condensation of two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde results in the final product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
