    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Classifying the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituent groups on the benzene ring (C₆H₅-) based on their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves.\n    *   -CH₃ (Methyl group in Toluene, substance 1) - Activating\n    *   -C₂H₅ (Ethyl group in Ethylbenzene, substance 5) - Activating\n    *   -Cl (Chloro group in Chlorobenzene, substance 3) - Deactivating\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating groups.\n    *   -NO₂ (Nitro group in Nitrobenzene, substance 4)\n    *   -COOC₂H₅ (Ester group in Ethyl benzoate, substance 2)\n    *   -COOH (Carboxyl group in Benzoic acid, substance 6)\n\n### **2. Estimating Para-Isomer Yield**\n\nThe question asks for the order of *increasing* yield of the *para*-isomer.\n\n*   **Lowest Para-Yield (Meta-directors):** Substances with meta-directing groups (4, 2, and 6) will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The formation of the para-isomer will be very low. For bromination, these deactivating groups yield only trace amounts of the para-isomer.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (4, -NO₂):** The -NO₂ group is a very strong deactivator and meta-director. The para-isomer yield is negligible, often less than 1%.\n    *   **Benzoic acid (6, -COOH) and Ethyl benzoate (2, -COOC₂H₅):** These are also strongly deactivating, meta-directing groups. The para-isomer yield is extremely low. Data from nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows ethyl benzoate yielding about 5% para product, which is still very small. Bromination of benzoic acid also predominantly yields the meta-product. Given that -NO₂ is a stronger deactivating group than -COOH and -COOC₂H₅, it will produce the least amount of the non-meta (para) isomer. Between -COOH and -COOC₂H₅, their directing effects are very similar, leading to very low para yields. The general trend for para yield among these is: -NO₂ < -COOH < -COOC₂H₅. Thus, the order starts with **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Highest Para-Yield (Ortho, para-directors):** Substances with ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, and 3) will have a much higher yield of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by sterics.\n    *   **Toluene (1, -CH₃) and Ethylbenzene (5, -C₂H₅):** Both methyl and ethyl groups are activating ortho-, para-directors. Because the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃), it creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This steric hindrance makes substitution at the para position more favorable for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. Therefore, the percentage of para-isomer will be higher for ethylbenzene (5) than for toluene (1). For bromination, toluene gives about 33-40% para-isomer.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho- and para-. Due to the strong inductive effect of the halogen, the para position is strongly favored over the ortho position. For bromination of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is the major product, with yields reported as high as 89% to 97% under certain catalytic conditions. This is significantly higher than the para-yield from toluene or ethylbenzene.\n\n### **3. Final Ordering**\n\nCombining these findings, we can arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** The lowest para yield due to the strong meta-directing -NO₂ group.\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para yield from the meta-directing -COOH group, but slightly more than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Very low para yield from the meta-directing -COOC₂H₅ group, generally slightly more than benzoic acid.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Moderate para yield (around 33-40%) from the ortho-, para-directing -CH₃ group.\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Higher para yield than toluene due to the increased steric hindrance of the -C₂H₅ group favoring the para position.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** The highest para yield (often ~90%) due to the electronic and steric properties of the -Cl group strongly favoring para substitution.\n\nThe complete order is therefore: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nC) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nD) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe derived order matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
