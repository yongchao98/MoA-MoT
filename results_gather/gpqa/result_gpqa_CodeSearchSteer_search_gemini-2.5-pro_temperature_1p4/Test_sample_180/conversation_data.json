    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources in the Energy Bands\n\nFirst, we need to identify which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the two specified energy bands under normal conditions.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV):**\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** The pp-III branch produces Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. This spectrum contributes to the flux in this band.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Neutrinos from the CNO cycle (specifically from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays) also have continuous spectra that extend into this energy range.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV):**\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos:** The pp-II branch produces Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) neutrinos. This reaction creates a mono-energetic line at 862 keV (0.862 MeV). This is a very strong line and is the dominant feature in this energy band.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** The continuous spectrum from ⁸B decay also contributes to this band.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** The CNO cycle neutrinos also contribute a small amount of flux in this band.\n\n### 2. Apply the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**.\n\n*   The pp-III branch is the source of **⁸B neutrinos**. Therefore, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos ceases completely.\n*   All other reactions, including the **pp-II branch (source of ⁷Be neutrinos)** and the **CNO cycle**, remain as they were.\n\n### 3. Re-evaluate Fluxes After the Change\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining sources of flux in each band after the pp-III branch has stopped.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):**\n    *   The ⁸B neutrino flux is now zero.\n    *   The only remaining source of neutrinos in this energy range is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle**.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):**\n    *   The ⁸B neutrino flux is now zero.\n    *   The main source remains: the powerful **⁷Be neutrino line at 862 keV**.\n    *   There is still a small contribution from CNO cycle neutrinos as well.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n\n*   **Numerator (Flux in Band 1):** This is the flux from CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range.\n*   **Denominator (Flux in Band 2):** This is the flux from the ⁷Be line plus the flux from CNO neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range.\n\nTo estimate the ratio, we must compare the magnitudes of these fluxes. According to Standard Solar Models:\n*   The total flux of **⁷Be neutrinos** is approximately 5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s. This entire flux is concentrated in two lines, with the 862 keV line being the most prominent by far.\n*   The total flux from the main **CNO cycle neutrinos** (¹³N and ¹⁵O) is approximately 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s. This flux is spread across a wide continuous energy spectrum.\n\nThe flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the ⁷Be line. The contribution from CNO neutrinos in that narrow 100 keV band is negligible in comparison. Therefore, we can approximate:\n*   Flux (Band 2) ≈ Flux (⁷Be line at 862 keV)\n\nThe flux in Band 1 is only from CNO neutrinos, and it represents just a small slice of the total CNO spectrum.\n\nLet's compare the total flux of the contributing sources: The total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos (~5.0 x 10⁹) is about **10 times larger** than the total flux of CNO neutrinos (~5 x 10⁸).\n\nThe ratio is essentially:\n(A small fraction of the total CNO flux) / (The total ⁷Be flux)\n\nSince the total CNO flux is already about 1/10th of the ⁷Be flux, and the numerator is only a small portion of that CNO flux, the resulting ratio must be significantly smaller than 1/10.\n\nA more quantitative look:\n*   **Denominator (Flux Band 2):** ~ 5 x 10⁹\n*   **Numerator (Flux Band 1):** The CNO flux is spread out up to ~1.7 MeV. The 100 keV slice from 700-800 keV will contain a fraction of the total CNO flux (5 x 10⁸). A rough estimate would put this fraction around 1/10th of the total, so ~5 x 10⁷.\n\n**Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) = 0.01**\n\nThis leads to an approximate ratio of 10⁻².\n\nFinal check:\n*   Flux in band 1 after change: Only from CNO cycle. This is a low-flux source.\n*   Flux in band 2 after change: Dominated by the ⁷Be line from the pp-II chain. This is a very high-flux source.\n*   The ratio of a low flux to a very high flux will be a small number. The relative total fluxes of the parent reactions (CNO vs ⁷Be) is about 1 to 10. This makes the ratio in the order of 0.01 plausible.\n\nThus, the approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands is 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>"
