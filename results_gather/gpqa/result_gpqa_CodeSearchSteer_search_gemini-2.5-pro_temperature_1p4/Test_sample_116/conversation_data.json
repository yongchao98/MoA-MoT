    "Based on the analysis of the molecules and the information gathered from the search results, here is the determination for each compound:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. For optical isomerism due to a chiral carbon, the carbon must be bonded to four different groups. This is not the case for benzophenone. The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism in its ground state. While benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral form, the individual molecule itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene. Its structure is symmetrical, and the molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompounds 1 and 2 are capable of showing optical isomerism. Compound 1 exhibits atropisomerism, and compound 2 has a chiral center. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
