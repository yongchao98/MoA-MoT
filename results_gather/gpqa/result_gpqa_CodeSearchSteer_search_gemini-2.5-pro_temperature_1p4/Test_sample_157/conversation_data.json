    "A dominant-negative mutation creates a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to be active. The mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, but it doesn't prevent dimerization entirely. Instead, the mutant (Y) subunit can still bind to a wild-type (WT) subunit, forming a non-functional or \"poisoned\" WT-Y heterodimer.\n\nThis interaction has two key consequences:\n1.  It sequesters the functional WT protein into inactive complexes, reducing the amount of functional WT-WT dimers. This interference leads to a dominant loss-of-function phenotype because even with one good allele, the protein's overall function is impaired.\n2.  The formation of abnormal or misfolded protein complexes, such as the WT-Y dimer, can trigger the cell's quality control mechanisms. These improperly formed complexes are often targeted for degradation by pathways like the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system. This results in the degradation of not only the mutant protein but also the wild-type protein that is bound to it.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype observed with mutation Y is the degradation of the protein (both mutant and the wild-type it is bound to) and a consequent loss-of-function of the wild-type allele's protein product.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n*   A) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype: While some dominant-negative mutations can cause aggregation, it is a specific outcome. Protein degradation is a more general and common fate for improperly formed complexes.\n*   B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele: This accurately describes a common mechanism for dominant-negative effects where the formation of non-functional dimers leads to their degradation, effectively eliminating the function of the wild-type protein sequestered in the complex.\n*   C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype: This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation that acts via dimerization interference causes a loss-of-function phenotype, not a wild-type one.\n*   D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype: This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation is a class of loss-of-function mutation, not gain-of-function.\n\n<<<B>>>"
