    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy of a photon required to excite a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest possible energy state and then determine the photon's momentum.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Energy Levels\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **v** is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **J** is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant.\n\n### 2. Identifying the States and Transition\n\n*   **Fundamental State:** The lowest energy state (ground state) occurs when v = 0 and J = 0.\n    *   E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B\\*0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Next Lowest Energy State Transition:** The absorption of a photon must follow specific selection rules. For rovibrational transitions, the rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. A pure vibrational transition (ΔJ = 0) is forbidden for most diatomic molecules.\n    *   The molecule starts in the (v=0, J=0) state.\n    *   According to the selection rules, the only allowed transition to the next vibrational level (v=1) is to the J=1 rotational state.\n    *   Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n    *   E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B\\*1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n### 3. Calculating the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **ΔE = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)**\n*   ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\n*   **ΔE = ħω + 2B**\n\nThis indicates the photon's energy is the sum of the vibrational energy change (ħω) and a small rotational energy change (2B).\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Mx = 20 amu\n*   My = 2 amu\n*   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   1 amu = 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1.  **Vibrational Energy (ħω):**\n    *   ΔE_vib = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ s⁻¹) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rotational Constant (B):** This requires finding the reduced mass (μ) and the moment of inertia (I).\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        *   μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        *   I = μ * R² ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        *   B = ħ² / (2I) ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n3.  **Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   ΔE = ħω + 2B = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + 2 * (4.60 x 10⁻²³ J)\n    *   ΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *(Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy).*\n\n### 5. Calculating Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy of a photon (E) is related to its momentum (p) by the equation E = pc. Therefore, the momentum is:\n\n*   **p = ΔE / c**\n*   p ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   **p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
