    "### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. It begins with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. For the reaction to complete and form the final product, a stable cyanohydrin, this intermediate must be protonated to create the hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent A's role is to provide this proton. A source of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺), representing an acidic workup, is required for this protonation step. NaHSO₃ is used for forming bisulfite adducts and is not the correct reagent for this transformation. Therefore, A must be H₃O⁺.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis. Cyanohydrins can be hydrolyzed to form α-hydroxy acids. This hydrolysis is typically carried out under strong acidic or basic conditions. Among the choices provided for reagent B, HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid commonly used to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids in the presence of water. CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and would not be effective for this conversion under normal conditions. Thus, B is HCl.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent A must be a proton source for the cyanohydrin formation, making **H₃O⁺** the correct choice.\n*   Reagent B must be a strong acid to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, making **HCl** the correct choice.\n\nThis combination is found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
