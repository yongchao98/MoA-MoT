    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the molecular formula and the presence of two oxygen atoms, this frequency is indicative of an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift around 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group bonded to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the amine (-NH₂) protons on an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to quadrupole coupling with the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the doublet at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is next to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBased on the combined evidence:\n*   **DoU:** A benzene ring and a C=O double bond.\n*   **IR:** A primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester (C=O) functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** An ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen, a primary amine group, and a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these features is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. The spectroscopic data provided in the problem align well with the known spectra for this compound.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Contains a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl side (`-C(=O)CH₂CH₃`), giving a quartet around 2.2-2.5 ppm, which contradicts the data.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Contains a primary amide and a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring, which is inconsistent with the IR and the NMR aromatic pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
