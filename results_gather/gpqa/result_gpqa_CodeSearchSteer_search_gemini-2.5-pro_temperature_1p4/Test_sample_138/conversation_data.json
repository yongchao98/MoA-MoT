    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water is a method for preparing α-diketones (also known as 1,2-diketones). The first step of this reaction is the in-situ formation of nitrous acid (HONO), which then generates the electrophilic nitrosonium ion (NO⁺). This ion reacts with the enol form of the ketone at the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). The intermediate product is an α-oximino ketone, which upon hydrolysis yields the α-diketone.\n\nThis reaction works by converting a methylene group (-CH₂) or a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a carbonyl group into a new carbonyl group.\n\nLet's analyze the two specific reactions:\n\n**Reaction A: A → 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe product is an α-diketone. For this product to form via the described reaction, the starting material must be a ketone with a carbonyl group at either position 1 or 2 of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   If the starting material is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**, the reaction will occur at the adjacent methylene group at position C2. The C2-H₂ group is converted into a carbonyl group, C=O, resulting in the desired product, 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n*   The other options for compound A, such as 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, are alcohols and would not undergo this specific transformation.\n\nTherefore, starting material **A** is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Reaction B: B → 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nThe product is also an α-diketone. To form this product, the starting ketone must have a carbonyl at position C2 or C3.\n*   If the starting material is **5-methylhexan-2-one**, it has a carbonyl group at C2 and an adjacent methylene group (-CH₂) at C3. This methylene group is susceptible to oxidation by the NaNO₂/HCl reagent to form a new carbonyl group. This process yields the final product, 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n*   The other options for compound B, like 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol, are diols and are not the correct starting material for this type of reaction.\n\nTherefore, starting material **B** is **5-methylhexan-2-one**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct pair of starting materials is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one for A and 5-methylhexan-2-one for B.\n\n<<<D>>>"
