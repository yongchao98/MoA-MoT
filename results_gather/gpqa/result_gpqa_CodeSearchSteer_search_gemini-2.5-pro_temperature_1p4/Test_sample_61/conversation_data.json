    "An analysis of the provided options reveals the most plausible reaction sequence. The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is characteristic of an aldol reaction product. The synthesis must therefore generate an appropriate aldehyde precursor from the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane.\n\nLet's break down the correct sequence:\n\n1.  **Alkylation of the terminal alkyne:** Ethynylcyclohexane is first treated with sodium amide (NaNH2), a strong base, to deprotonate the terminal alkyne and form a sodium acetylide. This acetylide is a potent nucleophile and is subsequently alkylated with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) to yield 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne.\n    *   C₆H₁₁C≡CH + NaNH₂ → C₆H₁₁C≡C⁻Na⁺\n    *   C₆H₁₁C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → C₆H₁₁C≡CCH₃\n\n2.  **Partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene:** The resulting internal alkyne, 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne, undergoes partial hydrogenation using hydrogen gas (H₂) with a poisoned catalyst, palladium on calcium carbonate (Pd-CaCO₃), also known as Lindlar's catalyst. This step selectively produces the cis-alkene, (Z)-1-cyclohexylpropene.\n    *   C₆H₁₁C≡CCH₃ + H₂/Pd-CaCO₃ → (Z)-C₆H₁₁CH=CHCH₃\n\n3.  **Reductive ozonolysis:** The alkene is then cleaved using ozone (O₃) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S). This ozonolysis reaction breaks the carbon-carbon double bond and forms two different carbonyl compounds: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    *   (Z)-C₆H₁₁CH=CHCH₃ + O₃, then (CH₃)₂S → C₆H₁₁CHO + CH₃CHO\n\n4.  **Aldol reaction:** The final step involves treatment with a base, barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), to induce an aldol reaction. While the reaction mixture contains two different aldehydes, which could lead to a mixture of products, this sequence is the only one provided that logically produces an aldol-type product. In practice, the more volatile acetaldehyde could be removed before the addition of the base, allowing for the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would yield 2-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. It is highly probable that the '1-' in the product's name is a typographical error for '2-'. Self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is known to be difficult due to steric hindrance but is plausible under these conditions.\n\nOther options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **A)** This sequence involves complete hydrogenation to an alkane, which is unreactive in the subsequent steps.\n*   **B)** This sequence uses an oxidative workup for ozonolysis (O₃/H₂O), which would produce carboxylic acids instead of aldehydes, preventing the final aldol reaction.\n*   **D)** The use of methanol with sodium amide in the first step is incorrect as the strong base would react with the alcohol instead of the intended alkyne.\n\nTherefore, sequence C provides the only chemically viable pathway among the choices to synthesize an aldol product from ethynylcyclohexane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
