    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. While the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction for the alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid uses PBr₃ and Br₂, the use of bromine in acetic acid can also achieve alpha-halogenation of carbonyl compounds. Pyridine, a base, is used to facilitate the reaction, which results in the formation of bromoacetic acid.\n\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH)\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion in a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n### Step 4: Formation of Product 4\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a multi-step process within a single reaction vessel:\n1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton on ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the carbon between the cyano group and the ester group (the α-carbon) are particularly acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of both adjacent functional groups.\n2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one of the bromine atoms in an SN2 reaction.\n3.  **Cyclization:** The presence of excess sodium hydride facilitates a second deprotonation at the same α-carbon. The newly formed carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This process forms a six-membered ring.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. Let's analyze its structure to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nThe structure is:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   A cyano group (-CN).\n*   The ester and cyano groups are attached to the same carbon (C1) of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe hydrogen atoms in the molecule are:\n1.  **Ethyl group CH₂:** These two hydrogens are chemically equivalent.\n2.  **Ethyl group CH₃:** These three hydrogens are chemically equivalent.\n3.  **Cyclohexane ring:** Due to the chair conformation of the cyclohexane ring, we must consider the axial and equatorial positions.\n    *   **C2 and C6 positions:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4. However, at each of these carbons, the axial and equatorial hydrogens are in different chemical environments. Therefore, the four hydrogens at C2 and C6 give two distinct signals (one for the two axial H and one for the two equatorial H).\n    *   **C3 and C5 positions:** These positions are also equivalent due to the same plane of symmetry. Again, the axial and equatorial hydrogens are distinct. This gives another two signals (one for the two axial H and one for the two equatorial H).\n    *   **C4 position:** The axial and equatorial hydrogens at the C4 position are distinct from each other and from all other hydrogens in the molecule. This contributes two more unique signals.\n\n**Counting the distinct signals:**\n*   Signal 1: -O-**CH₂**-CH₃ (quartet)\n*   Signal 2: -O-CH₂-**CH₃** (triplet)\n*   Signal 3: Axial hydrogens at C2 and C6\n*   Signal 4: Equatorial hydrogens at C2 and C6\n*   Signal 5: Axial hydrogens at C3 and C5\n*   Signal 6: Equatorial hydrogens at C3 and C5\n*   Signal 7: Axial hydrogen at C4\n*   Signal 8: Equatorial hydrogen at C4\n\nTherefore, there will be a total of 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
