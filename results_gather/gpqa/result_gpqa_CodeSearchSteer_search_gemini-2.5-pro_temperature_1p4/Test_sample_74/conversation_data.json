    "To determine why the protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed. The sequence should encode the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein.\n\nThe analysis involves translating the nucleotide sequence into an amino acid sequence, paying close attention to the start codon, the reading frame, and any potential stop codons.\n\n1.  **Identify the Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon that codes for Methionine. Translation will begin here.\n2.  **Translate the HA Tag:** The HA tag amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. Let's translate the provided DNA sequence from the start codon in three-nucleotide groups (codons):\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M) - The start codon.\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    This part of the sequence correctly codes for the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) preceded by a starting methionine.\n3.  **Continue Translation:** The sequence immediately follows with:\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   `TGA` -> **Stop**\n\nThe analysis reveals a `TGA` codon directly after the sequence for the HA tag and one additional amino acid. `TGA` is one of the three universal stop codons (`UAA`, `UAG`, and `UGA` in mRNA) that signals the ribosome to terminate translation.\n\nThis premature termination codon (PTC) will cause the ribosome to detach from the mRNA, releasing a very short, non-functional peptide of only 11 amino acids (MYPYDVPDYAK) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This directly explains the failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. The `TGA` stop codon caused premature termination.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. The stop codon is `TGA`, not `TAA`. More importantly, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While possible in other circumstances, the definitive cause here is the failure to synthesize a full-length protein in the first place due to the PTC.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The HA tag sequence itself is correct; the error is a nonsense mutation immediately following it.\n\nThe clear and identifiable error is the premature stop codon.\n\n<<<A>>>"
