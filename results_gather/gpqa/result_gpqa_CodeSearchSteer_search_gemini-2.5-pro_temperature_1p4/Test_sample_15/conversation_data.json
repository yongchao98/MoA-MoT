    "To determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, each compound must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a single chiral center guarantees chirality, while molecules with multiple chiral centers can be achiral if they are meso compounds (containing an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This molecular planarity makes the compound superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The 'R' and 'S' designations indicate the presence of chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral and thus optically active.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that makes them achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. Consequently, this molecule is not optically active.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. The (2R, 3R) configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S). Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1, which is a chiral center. The four groups attached to this carbon are different, and there is no internal plane of symmetry. As a specific enantiomer, this compound is chiral and optically active.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is also known as cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This arrangement creates a plane of symmetry that passes through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposite carbon atom in the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is an achiral meso compound and is not optically active.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure, which is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)C₅H₉, reveals that there are no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups, making it achiral. The rest of the molecule also lacks any chiral elements. Therefore, the compound is achiral and not optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
