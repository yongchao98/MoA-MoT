    "The problem asks for the probability of a sequence of quantum measurements. The steps to solve this are grounded in the postulates of quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Initial State Normalization**: Any state vector `|ψ⟩` must be normalized before being used to calculate probabilities. The initial state is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`. The norm squared is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 6`. Thus, the normalized state is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`.\n\n2.  **First Measurement (Operator P)**: The first measurement is of the observable P, and we are interested in the outcome being 0. According to the principles of quantum measurement, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. We must find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue `p = 0`.\n    The matrix for P is:\n    P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    The eigenvector `|p_0⟩` for the eigenvalue `p=0` is found by solving `P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩`. This leads to the normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)`.\n\n3.  **Probability of the First Measurement**: The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the corresponding eigenvector and the state vector of the system.\n    Probability(P=0) = `|⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2 * 1/√6) * [1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1)] = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n    Probability(P=0) = `(-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n4.  **State Collapse**: After a measurement, the system's state collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. So, after measuring `P=0`, the new state of the system `|ψ'⟩` is the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n    `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)`\n\n5.  **Second Measurement (Operator Q)**: The second measurement is of the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`, and we are interested in the outcome being -1. The matrix for Q is:\n    Q = [,, [0, 0, -1]]\n    This is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. The eigenvector `|q_-1⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `q=-1` is `(0, 0, 1)`.\n\n6.  **Probability of the Second Measurement**: We calculate the probability of measuring `Q=-1` in the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    Probability(Q=-1 after P=0) = `|⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = [0*(1/√2) + 0*(0) + 1*(-1/√2)] = -1/√2`\n    Probability(Q=-1 after P=0) = `(-1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n7.  **Total Probability**: The probability of a sequence of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\n    Total Probability = Probability(P=0) * Probability(Q=-1 after P=0)\n    Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThe final probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
