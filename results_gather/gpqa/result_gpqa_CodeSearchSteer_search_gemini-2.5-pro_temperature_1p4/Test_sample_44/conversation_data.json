    "To determine the energies of the system, we must consider the quantum states of the four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nFirst, let's define the single-particle energy levels in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in quantum state *n* is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²) = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nEach energy level *n* can accommodate two fermions, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\nFor the ground state, the four particles must be placed in the lowest possible energy levels to achieve the minimum total energy.\n*   Two particles will occupy the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles will occupy the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n### First Excited State Energy\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we need to move one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level, resulting in the smallest possible increase in total energy. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level. Their energy is 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level. Its energy is 1 * E₂ = 1 * (4E) = 4E.\n*   One particle is promoted to the n=3 level. Its energy is 1 * E₃ = 1 * (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\nFor the second excited state, we consider the next lowest energy configurations above the first excited state. There are a few possibilities starting from the ground state:\n1.  Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3: The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = 2 * E₁ + 2 * E₃ = 2 * (1E) + 2 * (9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n2.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4: The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = 2 * E₁ + 1 * E₂ + 1 * E₄ = 2 * (1E) + 1 * (4E) + 1 * (16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n3.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3: The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = 1 * E₁ + 2 * E₂ + 1 * E₃ = 1 * (1E) + 2 * (4E) + 1 * (9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing these possible energies, the lowest energy above the first excited state is 18E.\nThe total energy of the second excited state is:\nE_second_excited = 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
