    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we will follow these steps:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Rest Mass:**\nThe nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3 (3 protons). Therefore, the mass number A (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6. The nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\nThe atomic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122 atomic mass units (amu). This mass includes its 3 electrons. To find the nuclear mass, we must subtract the mass of the 3 electrons (0.00054858 amu each).\n\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.00054858 amu = 0.00164574 amu\n*   Nuclear mass of ⁶Li = 6.015122 amu - 0.00164574 amu = 6.01347626 amu\n\n**2. Convert Rest Mass to Rest Energy (E₀):**\nThe energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit (1 amu) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c².\nWe can calculate the rest energy (E₀ = m₀c²) of the ⁶Li nucleus:\n\n*   E₀ = 6.01347626 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu\n*   E₀ ≈ 5601.5598 MeV\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe speed (v) is given as 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n*   v²/c² = (0.96c)² / c² = 0.9216\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ = 3.57142857\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy (E = γ * E₀).\n\n*   E = 3.57142857 * 5601.5598 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20005.57 MeV\n\n**5. Convert to Giga-electron Volts (GeV):**\nSince 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, we convert the total energy to GeV.\n\n*   E = 20005.57 MeV / 1000\n*   E ≈ 20.0056 GeV\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 21.419 GeV\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.0056 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy might arise from using a slightly different value for the amu-to-MeV conversion factor or the precise mass of the Li-6 nucleus. For instance, some sources use 931.494 MeV/c² per amu. Let's re-calculate with this more precise value:\n\n*   E₀ = 6.01347626 amu * 931.494 MeV/amu ≈ 5601.49 MeV\n*   E = 3.57142857 * 5601.49 MeV ≈ 20005.3 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20.0053 GeV\n\nThe result remains very close to 20.132 GeV, which is the best fit among the choices. The difference is likely due to rounding or slight variations in the fundamental constants used in the problem's source.\n\n<<<C>>>"
