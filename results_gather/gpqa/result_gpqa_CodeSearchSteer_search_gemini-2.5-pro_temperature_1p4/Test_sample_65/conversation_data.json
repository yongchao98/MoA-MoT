    "The search results confirm my initial analysis. Here is a summary of the findings:\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry (1 and 2):** Multiple sources explicitly state that SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz-invariant and Poincare-invariant local quantum field theory. Source lists \"manifestly Poincaré-invariant local quantum theory\" as a fundamental assumption of SMEFT, and clarifies that Poincaré-invariant entails both Lorentz and translational invariance. Source also states that the SMEFT Lagrangian is built from SM fields obeying gauge and Poincaré symmetries. Therefore, Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry (3):** The search results show that SMEFT is used to parameterize new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. Many papers are dedicated to classifying and studying CP-violating operators in SMEFT. This indicates that CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian. In fact, SMEFT provides a framework to study potential new CP-violating effects.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT is defined as such a theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Source explicitly mentions that a violation of CPT symmetry implies a violation of Lorentz invariance, linking the two. Source also lists CPT conservation as a consequence of the fundamental assumptions.\n\nBased on this evidence, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
