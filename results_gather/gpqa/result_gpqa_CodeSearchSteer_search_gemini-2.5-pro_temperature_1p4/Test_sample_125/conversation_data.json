    "### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at the C5 position. The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, creates a new stereocenter. This reaction results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers, meaning they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. Reduction with excess sodium borohydride (NaBHâ‚„) converts both ketone groups into hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This process creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are:\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (a meso compound)\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses an achiral reagent, this pair of enantiomers is produced as a racemic mixture (an equal mixture of both). The (2R, 4S) isomer is a meso compound, which is achiral and is a diastereomer of the other two isomers. In total, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\nThe combined products from both reactions are analyzed using two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different polarities and will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The product mixture contains a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable under these conditions and will elute together as a **single peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different retention time, appearing as a **separate peak**. This gives a total of **two peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption given their different molecular structures), the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\nTotal peaks = 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis method uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, yielding **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) from each other, resulting in **two distinct peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the others, will also be separated, eluting as a **third peak**. Therefore, the products of Reaction II will show **three peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all separated compounds.\nTotal peaks = 2 (from I) + 3 (from II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
