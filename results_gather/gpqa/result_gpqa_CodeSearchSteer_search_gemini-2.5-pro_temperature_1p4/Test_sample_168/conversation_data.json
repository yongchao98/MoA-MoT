    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the nuclear decay to determine the correct comparison of the energy spectra.\n\n### Analysis of the Original Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V\n\n1.  **Nature of the Spectrum:** The original decay produces four light particles in the final state (two E particles and two V particles) that share the available energy. In any decay process with three or more particles in the final state, the energy released is shared among them in a continuous distribution. This is because there are many ways to conserve energy and momentum among the particles. Therefore, the total energy of the two E particles will have a continuous spectrum, ranging from near zero to a maximum value.\n\n2.  **The Endpoint (Q):** The endpoint of a beta decay spectrum represents the maximum possible kinetic energy the emitted particle(s) of interest can have. This occurs when the other light particles (in this case, the two V particles) carry away the minimum possible energy. The total energy released, known as the Q-value, is determined by the mass difference between the initial and final nuclei. A portion of this energy must be used to create the rest mass of the emitted particles. The remaining energy appears as kinetic energy. In this case, the endpoint of the kinetic energy spectrum for the two E particles is the Q-value minus the energy required to create the two V particles.\n\n### Analysis of the Variant Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + M\n\n1.  **Nature of the Spectrum:** In this variant decay, there are three light particles in the final state (two E particles and one M particle) that share the available energy. Since this is still a multi-body decay (more than two final particles), the energy distribution among them remains continuous. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous, though its specific shape will be adjusted due to the change in the number of particles sharing the energy. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n2.  **The Endpoint (Q'):** The total energy released (Q-value) is identical to the original decay because it depends only on the mass difference between the nuclei A and B. However, the composition of the emitted light particles has changed. The original decay emitted two V particles, which have some mass, while the variant decay emits a single *massless* particle M.\n\n*   **Original Decay Endpoint:** The maximum kinetic energy available to the E particles is `Q_kinetic = Q_total - (rest mass energy of 2V)`.\n*   **Variant Decay Endpoint:** The maximum kinetic energy available to the E particles is `Q'_kinetic = Q_total - (rest mass energy of M)`.\n\nSince particle M is massless, its rest mass energy is zero. The two V particles, being massive, have a combined rest mass energy greater than zero. Less energy is \"spent\" creating the rest mass of the outgoing light particles in the variant decay. Consequently, more energy is available as kinetic energy for the final particles.\n\nThis means the maximum possible kinetic energy for the two E particles is higher in the variant decay. Therefore, the endpoint of the spectrum increases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe decay spectrum of the E particles remains continuous because the final state still contains multiple bodies sharing the energy. The endpoint of this continuous spectrum increases because replacing two massive V particles with one massless M particle liberates more kinetic energy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
