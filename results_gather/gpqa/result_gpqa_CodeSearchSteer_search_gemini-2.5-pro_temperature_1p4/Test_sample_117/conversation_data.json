    "The reaction between an enol and a halogen like bromine is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry. The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is an enol, which is an alkene with a hydroxyl group attached to one of the double-bond carbons. Enols are generally unstable and exist in equilibrium with their more stable keto tautomers. However, they are highly reactive towards electrophiles.\n\nThe major outcome of this reaction is not the addition of two bromine atoms across the double bond, but rather an alpha-halogenation. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks a molecule of bromine (Brâ‚‚).\n2.  This attack forms a new carbon-bromine bond at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the one bearing the hydroxyl group) and displaces a bromide ion.\n3.  The intermediate then loses a proton from the hydroxyl group to regenerate the stable carbonyl (C=O) double bond.\n\nIn the case of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between carbon-1 (with the -OH group) and carbon-2. The reaction will add a bromine atom to carbon-2, and the enol at carbon-1 will be converted to a ketone. The resulting molecule is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nTherefore, the correct major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
