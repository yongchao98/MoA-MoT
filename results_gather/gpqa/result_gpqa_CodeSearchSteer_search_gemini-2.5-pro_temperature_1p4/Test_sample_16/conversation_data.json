    "The search results confirm my initial thought process. The key is to recognize the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex and use the formation constant to calculate the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nThe problem is a classic equilibrium calculation:\n\n1.  **Reaction:** The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the reaction:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n    Given K_f = 5x10¹⁰.\n\n3.  **Dissociation:** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, which will then dissociate to a small extent. Let's consider the reverse reaction (dissociation):\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n4.  **ICE Table:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation. Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n    *   **Initial:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = +x\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   **Equilibrium:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n        *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n5.  **Calculation:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    5x10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n6.  **Simplification:** Because K_f is very large, the dissociation (x) is very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can approximate that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n7.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   x² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰)\n    *   x² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\n    *   x = √(4x10⁻¹³)\n    *   x = 2x10⁻⁶.⁵ M\n\n    To get a more standard number:\n    *   x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    *   x = √40 * 10⁻⁷ M\n    *   Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is about 6.3.\n    *   x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to 'x', which is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. This matches option A. The \"ideal pH\" assumption simplifies the problem by ensuring that the EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻), so the given K_f value can be used directly without needing to calculate a conditional formation constant.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and does not require further searching. The steps and the result are consistent with chemical equilibrium principles.The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented by the following equilibrium:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f, is given for the forward reaction:\n\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe expression for the formation constant is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nWe are given:\n*   Initial stoichiometric concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n*   K_f = 5x10¹⁰\n\nAt equilibrium, a small amount of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex will dissociate. Let's define the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium as 'x'. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the undissociated [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex will be its initial concentration minus the amount that has dissociated, which is (0.02 - x).\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formation constant expression:\n\n5x10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to 0.02 M. This allows us to make a simplifying assumption:\n(0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n5x10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the [Ca²⁺]:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5x10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\nx = √(4x10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
