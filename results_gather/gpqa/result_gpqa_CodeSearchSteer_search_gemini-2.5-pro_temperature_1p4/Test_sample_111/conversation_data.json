    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalization of the state |α>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state |ψ>:\n|ψ> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>\n\nTo normalize this state, we must ensure that the inner product `<α|α>` is equal to 1. The state |α> is related to |ψ> by a normalization constant C, such that |α> = C|ψ>.\n\nThe inner product is calculated as:\n<ψ|ψ> = <(1+i)up + (2-i)down | (1+i)up + (2-i)down>\n<ψ|ψ> = |1+i|² + |2-i|²\n<ψ|ψ> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThe normalization constant C is therefore `1/√<ψ|ψ>`, which is `1/√7`.\n\nThe normalized state |α> is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\nIn matrix notation, where |up> = `[1, 0]`ᵀ and |down> = `[0, 1]`ᵀ, the state vector is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * `[1+i, 2-i]`ᵀ\n\n### 2. The Operator A and its Eigenstates/Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: `Aij = ħ/2` if i ≠ j, and `Aij = 0` otherwise. In the {|up>, |down>} basis, the matrix representation of A is:\nA = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] = (ħ/2) * [,]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\ndet([[ -λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\nλ₁ = +ħ/2\nλ₂ = -ħ/2\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates):\n*   For λ₁ = +ħ/2, the eigenvector |v₁> is found by solving `(A - λ₁I)|v₁> = 0`. This yields the normalized eigenstate:\n    |v₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>) = (1/√2) * `[1, 1]`ᵀ\n*   For λ₂ = -ħ/2, the eigenvector |v₂> is found similarly. This yields the normalized eigenstate:\n    |v₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>) = (1/√2) * `[1, -1]`ᵀ\n\n### 3. Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in a specific eigenstate is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state |α> onto that eigenstate.\n\n*   **Probability P₁ of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    P₁ = |<v₁|α>|²\n    <v₁|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/√14\n    P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   **Probability P₂ of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    P₂ = |<v₂|α>|²\n    <v₂|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)\n    P₂ = |(-1+2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates |v₁> and |v₂> are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A for the state |α> is given by `<A> = <α|A|α>`. A simpler way to calculate it is by using the eigenvalues and the probabilities of measuring them:\n<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂\n<A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
