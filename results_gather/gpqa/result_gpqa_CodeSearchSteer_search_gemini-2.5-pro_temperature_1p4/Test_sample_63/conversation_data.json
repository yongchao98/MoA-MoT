    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Determine the Moles and Identity of Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g = mass of H₂O.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed in the reaction.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** This reacts with oxidizing gases, primarily oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms forming copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas providing this oxygen must be O₂. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. Therefore, the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The final volume of gas is 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with any of the reagents, suggesting it is a stable, non-acidic, and non-oxidizing gas. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most common gas fitting this description in such a decomposition.\n\n**2. Verify with Conservation of Mass**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial weight of the salt mixture, confirming our identification of the products and their quantities is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition produced H₂O, N₂, and O₂. This strongly suggests the decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. We are looking for two salts, A and B, in an equimolar mixture.\n\n*   Let's assume salt A is the source of the O₂ gas. A common salt that produces O₂, N₂, and H₂O on heating is ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The balanced reaction at higher temperatures is:\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   Let's assume salt B produces the remaining N₂ and H₂O. A common salt that decomposes to N₂ and H₂O is ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). The reaction is:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nNow, let's use the mole quantities to see if this combination works. The mixture is equimolar, so let `x` be the moles of salt A and `x` be the moles of salt B.\n\n*   From the 2NH₄NO₃ reaction, all the O₂ must come from this salt. The stoichiometry is 1 mole of O₂ for every 2 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n    *   Moles of NH₄NO₃ (`x`) = 2 * Moles of O₂ = 2 * 0.025 mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, we have **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (Salt A)**. Since the mixture is equimolar, we must also have **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (Salt B)**.\n\nLet's calculate the total products from this mixture:\n*   **From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   N₂ produced = 0.05 mol\n    *   O₂ produced = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol\n    *   H₂O produced = (0.05 * 4) / 2 = 0.10 mol\n*   **From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   N₂ produced = 0.05 mol\n    *   H₂O produced = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol\n\nNow, sum the products:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches our calculation)\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol (Matches our calculation)\n*   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol (Matches our calculation)\n\nThe identification of Salt A as **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and Salt B as **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of both salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in Salt A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in Salt B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
