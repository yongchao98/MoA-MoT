    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges. In this method, the grounded conducting sphere is replaced by an imaginary \"image\" charge, which, together with the original charge, reproduces the correct electric field outside the sphere and maintains the condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the image charge and its location**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = - (R/d) * q`.\n    *   The position of the image charge from the center is `b = R^2 / d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. This force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    However, when using the image charge method, the potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. This factor of 1/2 is crucial because the image charge is a mathematical tool representing the field of the induced surface charges; the field only exists in the space outside the conductor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the interaction energy**: The potential energy `U_interaction` between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is calculated using the standard formula for the potential energy of two point charges, `U = k * q1 * q2 / r`.\n    *   The two charges are `q` and `q' = - (R/d) * q`.\n    *   The distance between them is `d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   `U_interaction = k * q * [-(R/d)q] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   `U_interaction = - k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Determine the net system energy**: The total potential energy `U` of the system is half of this interaction energy.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * [- k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result can also be confirmed by integrating the force on the charge `q` as it's brought from infinity to the distance `d`. The force on the charge `q` due to the sphere is equal to the force from the image charge `q'`. The potential energy is the integral of this force over distance, which yields the same result.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
