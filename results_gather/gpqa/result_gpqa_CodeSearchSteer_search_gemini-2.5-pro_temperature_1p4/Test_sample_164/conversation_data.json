    "Evaluating the correctness of the four statements based on the search results:\n\n**Statement A) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nThis statement is correct. Research has been conducted on noble metal catalysts, such as platinum and palladium, for ethylene oligomerization. However, their high cost is a significant drawback for industrial applications, which has spurred research into more cost-effective alternatives like transition metals (e.g., nickel, cobalt, iron) and Group 6 metals (e.g., chromium).\n\n**Statement B) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThis statement is correct. Patents assigned to U.S.-based companies like Dow Global Technologies describe dual catalyst systems for producing specific grades of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). These systems are designed for use in various polymerization processes, including those used on an industrial scale.\n\n**Statement D) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene to form α-olefins (the branches). Numerous scientific sources confirm that aluminum-based activators, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) and other alkylaluminum compounds, are not only effective but are commonly used to activate the chromium catalysts that perform this oligomerization.\n\n**Statement C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nThis statement is correct. The selective oligomerization of ethylene to produce specific α-olefins like 1-hexene or 1-octene (which act as the regular branches) is a key industrial reaction. Catalysts based on chromium, a Group VIa (or Group 6) transition metal, are highly selective and active for this transformation. These chromium catalysts are used in conjunction with specific activators to generate the catalytically active species.\n\nAll statements except for D are correct. However, the question asks to identify *which* of the statements is correct, implying one best answer that represents the most crucial and accurate piece of information from the senior scientist.\n\n*   Statement D is factually wrong.\n*   Statements A, B, and C are all factually correct.\n*   Statement C describes the fundamental chemistry of the catalyst system required for the desired transformation (creating branches from ethylene). It explains *how* the second catalyst functions at a chemical level.\n*   Statement A provides a correct but secondary point about an alternative, more expensive catalytic route.\n*   Statement B describes the commercial status of the technology.\n\nIn the context of a scientist planning an experiment, understanding the core chemical components that work is the most fundamental piece of information. Therefore, statement C, which describes the type of catalyst (Group VIa metal) and the need for activators, is the most accurate and central piece of advice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
