    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Identify the reference frames.**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary reference frame (let's call it S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving reference frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities.**\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the moving frame (the glass, S') relative to the stationary frame (the lab, S).\n    *   `u'`: The velocity of the object (the light beam) relative to the moving frame (the glass, S').\n    *   `u`: The velocity of the object (the light beam) relative to the stationary frame (the lab, S). This is what we need to find.\n\n3.  **Determine the values of the known velocities.**\n    *   The speed of light in a vacuum is given as `c = 1`.\n    *   The index of refraction of the glass is `n`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass (as measured in the rest frame of the glass, S') is `u' = c/n`. Since `c=1`, this becomes `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The velocity of the glass is `v`. Since the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, we take `v` as positive.\n\n4.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'*v)/c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result matches option A. This effect is a classic example of relativistic velocity addition, first observed in the Fizeau experiment.\n\nThe final calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\nComparing this to the options provided:\n*   A) `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`\n*   B) `1`\n*   C) `(1-n*v)/(n+v)`\n*   D) `(1+n*v)/(n-v)`\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
