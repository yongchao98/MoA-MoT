    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required values.\n\n### Identifying the Reactants and Products\n\n1.  **Gas W:** The clue states that gas W's molecules contain the same number of neutrons and protons. A strong candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂ or ²H₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n2.  **Substance B:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly indicates that B is heavy water.\n\n3.  **Reaction of X and Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This suggests a reaction between a deuteride-containing reducing agent (Substance X) and heavy water (Liquid Y).\n\n4.  **Substance X and its Analogue:** The clue states that X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common reducing agents. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and common reducing agent. Its deuterated analog, Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits the description of Substance X.\n\n5.  **Reaction Confirmation:**\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ (X) with heavy water, D₂O (Y), would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n    *   This reaction is violent, similar to the known violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n    *   It produces Deuterium gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Aluminum hydroxide is known to be a precipitate.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, would cause decomposition: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`, releasing heavy water (B), which is consistent with experimental knowledge.\n\n6.  **Keto Acid Reaction:** A keto acid possesses both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group (three oxygen atoms in total). A powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol (which contains two oxygen atoms). This confirms that X is a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄. Milder agents like NaBH₄ would not reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion on Identity\n\nBased on the evidence, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The masses of all isotopes for these elements in the molecule must be summed.\n\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (H). In the molecule, it is present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium (²H). There are 4 deuterium atoms.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Al). There is 1 aluminum atom.\n*   **Isotopic Masses:** For the calculation, we use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of the most common isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n\n*   **Cumulative Mass Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Sum of these masses = 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\n<<<D>>>"
