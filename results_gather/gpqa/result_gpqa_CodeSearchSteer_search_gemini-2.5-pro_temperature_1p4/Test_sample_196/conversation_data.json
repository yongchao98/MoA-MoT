    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X):**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and the strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of an aromatic ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is a definitive signal for a carboxylic acid proton.\n        *   The two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) indicate a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A terminal methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to both a methyl and a methine group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton) and also coupled to two different adjacent groups.\n        *   Assembling these pieces confirms the alkyl group is a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (B).\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Search results confirm that red P and HI will reduce carboxylic acids completely to the corresponding alkanes. The reaction proceeds as R-COOH + 6HI → R-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI by reacting with the iodine (I₂) produced during the reaction.\n\n3.  **Determination of the Final Product:**\n    *   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The *sec*-butyl group on the other side of the ring remains unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is a benzene ring with a *sec*-butyl group and a methyl group in the *para* positions (positions 1 and 4).\n    *   The name of this product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n4.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect, the alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, not the final product.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This structure results from the complete reduction of the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a methyl group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
