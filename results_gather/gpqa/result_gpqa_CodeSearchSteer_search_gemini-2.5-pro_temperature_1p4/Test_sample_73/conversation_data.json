    "The process of radioactive decay is fundamentally a random, memoryless process. This \"memoryless\" property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability.\n\nThe decay of radioactive atoms is described by exponential decay law. The probability that a nucleus will decay per unit of time is a constant, known as the decay constant (λ). We can determine this constant from the initial information provided.\n\nFirst, let's establish the survival probability, which is the probability that an atom has *not* decayed by a certain time *t*. This is given by the formula:\n\n*P(survival)* = e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\n\n*P(survival for 100 min)* = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow we can find the decay constant, λ:\n\n0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\nln(0.68) = -100λ\n\nSo, the decay constant is:\n\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, this is equivalent to asking for the probability of decay within any 150-minute interval.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes:\n\n*P(survival for 150 min)* = e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\n\n*P(survival for 150 min)* = e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * -150)\n*P(survival for 150 min)* = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n*P(survival for 150 min)* = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nThe probability of the atom decaying within 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival probability:\n\n*P(decay in 150 min)* = 1 - *P(survival for 150 min)*\n*P(decay in 150 min)* = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
