    "To find the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. The Born rule in quantum mechanics states that the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a position x. Since the particle must be somewhere in the allowed region, the integral of this probability density over that region must be equal to 1.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we calculate the square of the modulus, |Ψ(x)|². For a complex number of the form z = u + iv, the modulus squared is z*z = u² + v². In this case, the real part is u = a / sqrt(1 + x) and the imaginary part is v = -0.5.\n\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density function from x=1 to x=3 and set the result to 1, which is the normalization condition.\n\n∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nNow, we evaluate each integral separately:\nFor the first integral, we can pull the constant a² out:\na² ∫₁³ [1 / (1 + x)] dx\n\nThe integral of 1 / (1 + x) is ln(1 + x).\na² [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n= a² [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)]\n= a² [ln(4) - ln(2)]\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c), this simplifies to:\n= a² ln(4/2)\n= a² ln(2)\n\nFor the second integral:\n∫₁³ 0.25 dx\n= [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n= 0.25(3 - 1)\n= 0.25(2)\n= 0.5\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the normalization equation:\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNext, we solve for \"a\":\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, which is ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\na ≈ √0.7215\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
