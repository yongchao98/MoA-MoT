    "To identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided 1H NMR data and match it to one of the four possible structures: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n1.  **Integration (Number of Protons):**\n    *   The signals have relative proton counts of 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The total number of protons is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formulas:\n        *   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂): Has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂): Has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since the spectrum shows a total of 8 protons, we can confidently eliminate both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n2.  **Signal Breakdown:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 protons is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (–OCO**CH₃**). These protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with, hence they appear as a singlet.\n    *   The remaining signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm must belong to the propenyl group (**CH₃**-**CH**=**CH**–).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond. It's a doublet because it's split by the single proton on the adjacent carbon (–CH=**CH**-CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** and **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These are the two vinylic protons (protons on the double bond).\n\n3.  **Determining Cis vs. Trans Isomerism:**\n    *   The key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons.\n    *   For *trans* isomers, the vicinal coupling constant (³J) is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   For *cis* isomers, the vicinal coupling constant (³J) is smaller, usually between 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a *trans* configuration.\n    *   This large coupling constant confirms that the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n    *   The proton at 7.0 ppm is significantly downfield due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n    *   The proton at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). It is split into a doublet by the *trans* vinylic proton (with J ≈ 16.0 Hz) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe integration values indicate a propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons is definitive for a *trans* stereochemistry. All splitting patterns and chemical shifts are consistent with the structure of trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
