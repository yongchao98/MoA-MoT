    "To determine what is being observed, we must first identify the energy of the absorption line in its own reference frame (the rest-frame energy), and then connect that energy to a known atomic or molecular transition.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Redshift (z)\n\nThe structure is located at a cosmological distance, meaning the light from it is stretched to longer wavelengths (redshifted) by the expansion of the universe. The given distance is a comoving radial distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc). Using a standard cosmological model (like the Planck18 model) with a Hubble constant (H₀) of approximately 67.7 km/s/Mpc and matter density (Ωₘ) of 0.31, a comoving distance of 2100 Mpc (2.1 Gpc) corresponds to a redshift (z) of approximately 0.5.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)\n\nThe observed energy (E_obs) is related to the rest-frame energy (E_rest) by the redshift. The formula is:\n\nE_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\n\nGiven:\n*   E_obs = 3.9 µeV (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV)\n*   z ≈ 0.5\n\nCalculation:\nE_rest = 3.9 µeV * (1 + 0.5) = 3.9 µeV * 1.5 = 5.85 µeV\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Transition\n\nThe calculated rest-frame energy of ~5.85 µeV is characteristic of a specific, well-known spectral line in radio astronomy: the 21-cm line. This line is generated by the spin-flip transition in the ground state of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). The precise energy of this transition is approximately 5.874 µeV. Our calculated rest-frame energy is an excellent match.\n\n### Step 4: Relate the Transition to the Interstellar Medium\n\nThe 21-cm line is a fundamental tool for studying the interstellar medium (ISM). Neutral atomic hydrogen exists in different \"phases,\" primarily the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM).\n\n*   **Cold Neutral Medium (CNM):** Characterized by low temperatures (around 10-100 K) and relatively high densities. It is most readily observed through the absorption of the 21-cm line against background radio sources.\n*   **Warm Neutral Medium (WNM):** Has higher temperatures (around 6000-10,000 K) and lower densities. While it produces most of the 21-cm *emission*, its absorption signature is very weak due to its high temperature.\n*   **Molecular Media (B and D):** These are dominated by molecular hydrogen (H₂) and are traced by the emission lines of other molecules like carbon monoxide (CO), not the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen.\n\nSince the observation is of an *absorption* line corresponding to the 21-cm transition, it is tracing the cold atomic gas. Therefore, the equivalent medium in the Milky Way is the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<C>>>"
