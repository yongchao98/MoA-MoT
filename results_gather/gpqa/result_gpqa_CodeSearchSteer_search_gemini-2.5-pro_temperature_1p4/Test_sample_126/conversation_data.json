    "The heating of a 1,5-diene is the classic condition for a Cope rearrangement. This reaction is a-sigmatropic rearrangement, which involves a cyclic, concerted movement of six electrons over a six-atom system, resulting in the breaking of one sigma bond and the formation of another, along with the shifting of two pi bonds.\n\nTo determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, we can follow the mechanism of the Cope rearrangement:\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material**: The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is:\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n    This is a 1,5-diene, with the double bonds located between carbons 2-3 and 6-7. The six atoms directly involved in the rearrangement are C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7.\n\n2.  **Apply the-Sigmatropic Shift**: The Cope rearrangement proceeds through a chair-like transition state. In this process:\n    *   The sigma bond between carbon-4 and carbon-5 breaks.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between carbon-2 and carbon-7.\n    *   The pi bond between C2 and C3 moves to form a new pi bond between C3 and C4.\n    *   The pi bond between C6 and C7 moves to form a new pi bond between C5 and C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product**: Following the electron rearrangement, we can trace the new connectivity of the atoms.\n    *   The original chain is broken between C4 and C5.\n    *   A new C2-C7 bond links the two fragments.\n    *   The original C1 (methyl group) is now a substituent on C2.\n    *   The butyl group remains a substituent on C5.\n    *   The ethyl group (C8 and C9) remains a substituent on C7.\n\n    The resulting structure has the following skeleton:\n    `H₂C=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)`\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: To name the product according to IUPAC nomenclature, we first find the longest carbon chain that contains both double bonds.\n    *   The longest chain includes the vinyl group (`H₂C=CH-`), continues through the core of the molecule, and extends through the full length of the butyl group.\n    *   This main chain has 10 carbon atoms, making the parent name a `deca-diene`.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the end that gives the double bonds the lowest possible locants (starting from the `H₂C=` carbon as C1), the double bonds are at positions 1 and 5. The parent name is therefore `deca-1,5-diene`.\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at position 3 and an ethyl group at position 4.\n    *   Arranging the substituents alphabetically, the final name of the product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene - Incorrect carbon chain length and structure.\nB) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene - Correctly matches our derived product.\nC) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene - Incorrect substituent and double bond positions.\nD) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene - This is a duplicate of option C.\n\nTherefore, the molecule formed is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
