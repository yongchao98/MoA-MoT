    "To determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first deduce the structure of the product.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reactants\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula.\n        *   \"cyclohex-3-ene\" ring: A 6-carbon ring with one double bond.\n        *   \"-carboxylic acid\" group: -COOH\n        *   \"2-formyl\" group: -CHO\n        *   \"5-vinyl\" group: -CH=CH2\n    *   The base structure is a cyclohexane ring (C6). The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a formyl group, and a vinyl group, which add 1, 1, and 2 carbons respectively. This gives a total of 10 carbons (C10).\n    *   Counting the hydrogens: The structure is C10H12O3.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide variety of functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. This includes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) to alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Ketones (C=O) to methylene groups (-CH2-).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) and alkynes (C≡C) to alkanes.\n*   Alcohols (-OH) to alkanes.\n\nIn this reaction, all points of unsaturation and all oxygen-containing functional groups will be removed and reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n### 3. Determining the Product\n\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The `1-carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with two methyl groups and one ethyl group. An example isomer would be 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane. The initial carbon skeleton of 10 carbon atoms is retained. The product is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the following equation:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. Oxygen and halogens do not affect the IHD calculation in this form of the formula.\n\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** The product is a saturated cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms (C10). A saturated, non-cyclic alkane would have the formula CnH(2n+2). A saturated cycloalkane with one ring has the formula CnH(2n). Therefore, the molecular formula of our product is C10H20.\n\n*   **IHD Calculation:**\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be found by simply counting the number of rings and π-bonds in the structure. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which contains one ring and no π-bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
