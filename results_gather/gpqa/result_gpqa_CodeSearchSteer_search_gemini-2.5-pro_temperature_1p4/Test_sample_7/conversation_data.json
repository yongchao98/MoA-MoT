  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "To determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3, we must analyze the resistance levels of the single and double mutants.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2**: The wild-type (control) has 100% resistance. The `g2` single mutant has 0% resistance. Any double mutant including `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also shows 0% resistance. When a mutation in one gene (in this case, `g2`) masks the effect of mutations in other genes (`g1` and `g3`), it is called epistasis. Specifically, the gene whose phenotype is expressed is called epistatic. Here, `g2` is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`. This pattern is characteristic of an essential upstream regulator, such as a master transcription factor, whose function is required for the entire pathway. Therefore, the conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor is strongly supported.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3**:\n    *   The `g1` mutant loses 25% of the resistance (100% -> 75%).\n    *   The `g3` mutant loses 50% of the resistance (100% -> 50%).\n    *   If their effects were additive, the `g1g3` double mutant would be expected to lose 25% + 50% = 75% of the resistance, leaving 25%.\n    *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance, meaning a 90% loss. This loss is greater than the sum of the individual losses (90% > 75%). This type of interaction, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of the parts, is known as synergism or negative/aggravating epistasis.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis**:\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**: This option correctly identifies G2 as a likely transcription factor. The term \"pleiotropy\" describes a single gene affecting multiple traits; while we cannot confirm or deny this from the given data, it does not contradict it. The final claim, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\", would imply that the `g1g3` phenotype is the same as the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance). This is false, as the resistance is 10%.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**: This option incorrectly claims gene redundancy. Gene redundancy is a situation where one gene can compensate for the loss of another, resulting in a double mutant that is not significantly worse than the single mutants. The data shows the opposite (synergism), so this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**: This option incorrectly identifies G1 as the primary transcription factor. As established, G2 is epistatic to G1, not the other way around.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**: This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor. The claim about the promoter cannot be verified from this data. The final claim, \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\", would imply that the `g1g3` phenotype is the same as the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance). This is also false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll provided options contain at least one clause that is either incorrect or cannot be verified from the experimental data. Options B and C contain claims (\"gene redundancy\" and \"G1 is a transcription factor,\" respectively) that are definitively contradicted by the experimental results. Options A and D both correctly identify G2's role but incorrectly describe the interaction between G1 and G3 as a simple masking epistasis. However, between A and D, both contain a flaw in their final statement. The primary conclusion from the experiment is that G2 is an upstream transcription factor. Of the available choices, option A correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor and presents pleiotropy as a possible, non-falsifiable characteristic. Although its third clause about epistasis is technically incorrect under the standard definition of masking, the other options are more fundamentally flawed.\n\n<<<A>>>"
