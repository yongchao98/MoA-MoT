    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two factors: the star's apparent brightness and its position in the sky.\n\n**1. Brightness Limits:**\nA star must be bright enough for each instrument.\n*   **ESPRESSO (at Paranal Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (m_V < 17).\n*   **HIRES (at Keck Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (m_V < 16).\nFor a star to be seen by **both**, it must meet the stricter limit: **apparent V magnitude < 16**.\n\n**2. Positional Limits (Declination):**\nA star must rise above the horizon at both observatory locations.\n*   **Keck Observatory** is located in Hawaii at a latitude of approximately +20° N. It can physically observe stars with a declination (DEC) between -70° and +90°.\n*   **Paranal Observatory** is in Chile at a latitude of about -24° S. It can physically observe stars with a declination between -90° and +66°.\nFor a star to be seen from **both**, its declination must be in the overlapping range of **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\nThe instruction to disregard pointing limits and altitudes is interpreted as ignoring practical constraints like airmass, but not the fundamental fact that a star must be above the horizon to be seen.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n\n**Star1:**\n*   **Magnitude:** It has an absolute magnitude (M) of 15.5 at a distance (d) of 10 parsecs. The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the formula m - M = 5*log10(d) - 5. Since the distance is exactly 10 parsecs, the apparent magnitude is equal to the absolute magnitude, so **m = 15.5**. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n*   **Position:** Its declination is **-75°**. This is outside the observable range for Keck Observatory (-70° to +66°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star2:**\n*   **Magnitude:** Its apparent magnitude is given as **16.5**. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Position:** Declination is +55°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both (too faint for HIRES).\n\n**Star3:**\n*   **Magnitude:** Its apparent V magnitude is given as **15.5**. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit. The additional information about color excess is not needed to determine the observed brightness.\n*   **Position:** Its declination is **+48°**. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° to +66°).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n**Star4:**\n*   **Magnitude:** It has an absolute magnitude of 15.5 at a distance of 10 pc, but its light is dimmed by interstellar dust. The extinction (A_V) is calculated as 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 magnitudes. The final apparent magnitude is m = 15.5 + 1.24 = **16.74**. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n*   **Position:** Declination is -48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both (too faint for HIRES).\n\n**Star5:**\n*   **Magnitude:** It has an absolute magnitude (M) of 16.5 and is at a distance (d) of 5 parsecs. Its apparent magnitude is m = 16.5 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.5 - 5 = **15.0**. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n*   **Position:** Its declination is **+60°**. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° to +66°).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star3 and Star5 satisfy both the brightness and positional requirements to be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<C>>>"
