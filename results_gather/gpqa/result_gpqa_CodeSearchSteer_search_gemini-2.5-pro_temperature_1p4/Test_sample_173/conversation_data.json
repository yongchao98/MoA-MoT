    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Define Initial Parameters and Fragment Masses\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `M*c² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into a lighter fragment (mass `m_l`) and a heavier fragment (mass `m_h`).\n*   The heavier fragment is twice as massive as the lighter one: `m_h = 2 * m_l`.\n*   The sum of the fragment rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m_l + m_h = 0.99 * M`.\n\nBy substituting `m_h = 2 * m_l` into the sum, we get:\n`m_l + 2 * m_l = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m_l = 0.99 * M`\n`m_l = 0.33 * M`\n\nThis means the heavier fragment's mass is:\n`m_h = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Lighter fragment: `m_l * c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n*   Heavier fragment: `m_h * c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n`Q = (M*c²) - (m_l*c² + m_h*c²) `\n`Q = 300 GeV - (99 GeV + 198 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments: `T_l + T_h = 3 GeV`. The problem refers to the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T_h`) as `T1`.\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momentum (`p`) due to the law of conservation of momentum.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy E is also the sum of kinetic energy (T) and rest-mass energy (`E = T + mc²`). Combining these gives:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2T(mc²) + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²) `\n\nSince the momenta are equal, `(p_l*c)² = (p_h*c)²`. Therefore:\n`T_l² + 2*T_l*(m_l*c²) = T_h² + 2*T_h*(m_h*c²)`\n\nWe have two equations:\n1. `T_l + T_h = 3` (so `T_l = 3 - T_h`)\n2. `T_l² + 2*T_l*(99) = T_h² + 2*T_h*(198)`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`(3 - T_h)² + 198*(3 - T_h) = T_h² + 396*T_h`\n`(9 - 6T_h + T_h²) + (594 - 198T_h) = T_h² + 396T_h`\n\nThe `T_h²` terms cancel out. Combining the remaining terms:\n`603 - 204*T_h = 396*T_h`\n`603 = 600*T_h`\n`T_h = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`. Since momentum (`p`) is the same for both fragments:\n`T_l = p² / (2*m_l)` and `T_h = p² / (2*m_h)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n`T_l / T_h = m_h / m_l`\n\nSince `m_h = 2 * m_l`, we have `T_l = 2 * T_h`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy `T_l + T_h = 3 GeV`:\n`2*T_h + T_h = 3 GeV`\n`3*T_h = 3 GeV`\n`T_h = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classically approximated kinetic energy is `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nTo express this in Mega-electron volts (MeV), we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
