    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a slowly moving antiproton with a proton, which can be considered at rest. The annihilation results in the creation of two pairs of particle A and antiparticle A‚Åª.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is negligible.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n*   The rest mass energy of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is identical to that of a proton.\n*   Initial Energy ($E_i$):\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    This initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four final particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$).\n\n2.  **Final Energy**: The final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four 'A' particles. Since momentum is conserved and the initial momentum is approximately zero, the four resulting particles must have equal speeds to have a single defined velocity. The total energy for each particle 'A' is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   Rest mass energy of particle A ($m_A c^2$) = 300 MeV.\n*   Final Energy ($E_f$):\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n3.  **Equating Initial and Final Energy**:\n    $E_i = E_f$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n5.  **Calculating the Velocity**: The Lorentz factor is related to the velocity (v) by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for $v$.\n\n*   Let $\\beta = v/c$. The equation becomes $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$.\n*   Squaring both sides: $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n*   Rearranging for $\\beta^2$: $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   Solving for $\\beta$: $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is therefore approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<C>>>"
