    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. This causes a charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner cavity surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutral charge.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A key principle of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that they create an electrostatic shield. This means two things in this context:\n    *   The electric field inside the conducting material itself is zero. The induced charge `-q` on the cavity surface arranges itself in such a way as to perfectly cancel the electric field from the charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity, including within the conductor's material.\n    *   The charges inside the cavity are shielded from the outside, and crucially, the space outside the conductor is shielded from the exact location and arrangement of charges inside the cavity.\n4.  **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined electric field from the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero for any point outside the cavity.\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the conductor has a spherical outer surface (radius R) and there are no other external charges nearby, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. The location of the cavity and the charge within it do not affect the uniformity of the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect.\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric uniform charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from point P.\n    *   Therefore, the conductor acts like a point charge `+q` located at its center.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other variables, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance from the center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<A>>>"
