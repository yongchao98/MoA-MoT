    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, to both have the eigenvalue -ħ.\n\n### Analysis of the Quantum State\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. Here, `l_1=1` and `l_2=1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p-orbitals). The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=2`, and the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum is `m=-1`.\n\n2.  **Measurement Outcome**: We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L_1z` as -ħ and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` as -ħ. The eigenvalues of the `L_z` operator are given by `m_l * ħ`. Therefore, this measurement outcome corresponds to finding the system in a state where `m_{l1} = -1` for the first electron and `m_{l2} = -1` for the second electron.\n\n3.  **Final State**: The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state `|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>`, which can be written as `|1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n\n### The Role of the Total Angular Momentum z-component (`L_z`)\n\nThe total z-component of the angular momentum, `L_z`, is the sum of the individual z-components: `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}`. This relationship also holds for their respective quantum numbers: `m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}`.\n\n*   In the **initial state** `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, the system is an eigenstate of the total `L_z` operator with a well-defined quantum number `m = -1`. A measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will always yield the eigenvalue `mħ = -1ħ`.\n*   The **final state** we are interested in, `|1, -1; 1, -1>`, has `m_{l1} = -1` and `m_{l2} = -1`. The total magnetic quantum number for this state would be `m' = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe probability of obtaining this measurement result is given by the square of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final state. Let the initial state be `|ψ_initial> = |1, 1, 2, -1>` and the final state be `|ψ_final> = |1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n\nThe probability `P` is `P = |<ψ_final | ψ_initial>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`.\n\nTo evaluate this, we must express the initial coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states. The expansion is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. A coupled state `|l, m>` is a linear combination of uncoupled states `|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>` that satisfy the condition `m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m`.\n\nFor our initial state, `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, the condition is `m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1`. The possible combinations for `(m_{l1}, m_{l2})` (where each can be -1, 0, or 1) are `(-1, 0)` and `(0, -1)`. Thus, the expansion of the initial state only contains the uncoupled states `|1, -1; 1, 0>` and `|1, 0; 1, -1>`.\n\nCrucially, the state we are measuring, `|1, -1; 1, -1>`, is not part of this expansion. The uncoupled basis states are orthogonal. Therefore, the inner product of `|1, -1; 1, -1>` with `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is zero.\n\n`<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0`\n\nThis means the probability is 0. The measurement outcome `(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1)` is impossible because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The system has a total `m=-1`, and a measurement cannot find it in a state with a total `m'=-2`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
