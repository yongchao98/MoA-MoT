    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the expression:\nE = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\nwhere the sum is over all 8 possible states.\n\nLet's list all possible spin configurations and calculate the corresponding energy for each.\n\n**Case 1: All three spins are aligned.**\n*   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    The energy is E₁ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J.\n*   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    The energy is E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J.\nThere are **2** states that have an energy level of **-3J**.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are aligned in one direction, and the third is in the opposite direction.**\n*   **States with two +1 spins and one -1 spin:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E₃ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J.\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E₄ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J.\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E₅ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J.\n*   **States with two -1 spins and one +1 spin:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E₆ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J.\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E₇ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J.\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E₈ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J.\nThere are **6** states that have an energy level of **J**.\n\nNow, we can compute the partition function by summing the Boltzmann factors for all these states. We group the states by their energy levels:\n\nZ = (Number of states with energy -3J) * e^(-β(-3J)) + (Number of states with energy J) * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z= 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
