    "This is a classic chemistry puzzle that relies on identifying a specific, somewhat complex, chemical system. By logically breaking down the clues, we can deduce the identities of the unknown substances.\n\n**1. Identifying Gases B and D, and Solvent H:**\n\n*   **Clue 4:** Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n*   The most common and fitting reaction for this description is the formation of sulfuryl chloride:\n    **SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l)**\n*   Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is indeed a liquid solvent. This allows us to identify:\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas)\n    *   **D = SO₂** (Sulfur dioxide gas)\n    *   **H = SO₂Cl₂** (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n**2. Identifying the Acids F and G:**\n\n*   **Clue 3:** C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).\n*   Since C is formed from chlorine gas (B), its hydrolysis will almost certainly produce hydrochloric acid.\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), which is a strong acid.\n*   The weak acid, G, must therefore be formed from another element present in C.\n\n**3. Identifying the Core System (A and C):**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** Solid A + 8 Cl₂ (gas B) → Bright red product C.\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → A (reformed) + HCl (F) + G (weak acid).\n*   The regeneration of A upon hydrolysis is the key clue. It indicates that C is a derivative of A, and the parts of C that are cleaved off during hydrolysis form the acids F and G.\n*   This specific set of reactions, including the unusual 1:8 stoichiometry and the formation of a red product, points to a known, albeit complex, reaction in carbon-sulfur-nitrogen chemistry. However, a simpler and more direct interpretation that fits all the clues is often intended in such puzzles.\n\n**4. Identifying the Hazardous Product E:**\n\n*   **Clue 2:** C + 2 equivalents of SO₂ (gas D) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n*   Many hazardous chemicals could be potential candidates for E. However, given the reactants, some likely products are sulfur-chlorine or carbon-chlorine compounds.\n*   A prime candidate for an \"extremely hazardous\" product that can be formed from a chlorinated precursor is **phosgene (COCl₂)**. It is a notorious chemical warfare agent. Another possibility from the reactants is thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), also hazardous.\n*   Let's assume **E is Phosgene (COCl₂)**. For E to contain carbon, C and A must also be carbon-containing compounds. This aligns with the idea that the weak acid G could be carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) or oxalic acid.\n\n**5. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n\n*   To find the molecular symmetry group, we must determine the shape of molecule E.\n*   Assuming **E is Phosgene (COCl₂)**, its structure consists of a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n*   According to VSEPR theory, the three electron domains around the central carbon atom arrange themselves in a **trigonal planar** geometry to minimize repulsion.\n*   The molecule is not perfectly symmetrical because the C=O double bond and C-Cl single bonds are different. The molecule possesses:\n    *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   Two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ). One plane contains all the atoms (O, C, Cl, Cl), and the other is perpendicular to it, bisecting the O=C and Cl-C-Cl bonds.\n*   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nBoth phosgene (COCl₂) and sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) — two plausible hazardous products in this chemical system — have C₂ᵥ symmetry. This strengthens the conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>"
