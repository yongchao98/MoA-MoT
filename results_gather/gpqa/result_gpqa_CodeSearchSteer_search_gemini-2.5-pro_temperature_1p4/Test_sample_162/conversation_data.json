    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Atomic mass of Iron (Fe) = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol\n\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the minimum volume of acid needed\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) follows this stoichiometric reaction:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ to dissolve completely.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nThe problem specifies a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We can find the volume needed using the concentration formula:\n\n*   Volume (L) = Moles / Concentration\n*   Volume (L) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n\nConverting liters to cubic centimeters (1 L = 1000 cm³):\n\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis required volume is very close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option B.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nThe question asks for the pH of the *resulting solution* with a total volume of 100 cm³. When the minimum amount of acid is added, it is completely consumed in the reaction to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃. The resulting solution contains the product, Fe³⁺ ions, in water.\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) final volume:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume\n*   [Fe³⁺] = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\nThe iron(III) ion (Fe³⁺) is a weak acid that hydrolyzes in water, releasing H⁺ ions and thus lowering the pH. The primary hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)**\n\nTo find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction. Scientific literature provides values for the hydrolysis constants of Fe(III). At 25°C, log(Ka₁) is approximately -2.19.\n*   log(Ka) = -2.19\n*   Ka = 10⁻²·¹⁹ ≈ 6.46 x 10⁻³\n\nNow, we set up an equilibrium expression to find the [H⁺]:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n\nAssuming [H⁺] = [Fe(OH)²⁺] = x, and the initial [Fe³⁺] is 9.357 x 10⁻³ M:\n6.46 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (9.357 x 10⁻³ - x)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: x² + (6.46 x 10⁻³)x - (6.04 x 10⁻⁵) = 0.\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula gives:\nx = [H⁺] ≈ 5.14 x 10⁻³ M\n\nFinally, calculate the pH:\n*   pH = -log[H⁺]\n*   pH = -log(5.14 x 10⁻³) ≈ **2.29**\n\nThis calculated pH (2.29) and volume (28.07 cm³) are closest to the values presented in option B (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³). The slight discrepancy in pH may arise from using slightly different Ka values or considering further hydrolysis steps, but this analysis strongly points towards B as the correct answer. For instance, some sources might cite a Ka value closer to 10⁻³. If we were to use the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ to determine the equilibrium pH required to keep the iron dissolved, the pH would need to be very low, around 2. This confirms the acidic nature of the final solution.\n\nBased on the stoichiometric calculation for the volume of acid and the subsequent calculation for the pH due to the hydrolysis of the resulting Fe³⁺ ion, the answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
