    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we need to calculate the effects of time dilation based on Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. This involves a few key steps.\n\nFirst, we need to establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from Earth. The LMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and its distance is estimated to be approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\nNext, we calculate the time it would take to travel this distance from an observer's perspective on Earth. Since the spacecraft travels at 0.99999987 *c*, the time measured by an Earth-based observer (Δt) would be the distance divided by the speed:\n\n*   **Time (Earth frame) = Distance / Speed**\n*   Time ≈ 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 *c* ≈ 163,000.02 years\n\nThis is the time that would pass on Earth. However, for the astronaut traveling at such a high velocity, time will pass much more slowly. This effect is known as time dilation. The formula to calculate the time experienced by the traveling astronaut (the proper time, Δt₀) is:\n\nΔt₀ = Δt / γ\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δt** is the time measured by the stationary observer (on Earth).\n*   **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nLet's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for the given speed (v = 0.99999987*c*):\n\n1.  v/c = 0.99999987\n2.  v²/c² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n3.  1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n4.  √(1 - v²/c²) = √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n5.  γ = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.17\n\nNow we can calculate the time that passes for the astronaut (Δt₀):\n\n*   **Time (Astronaut frame) = Time (Earth frame) / γ**\n*   Time (Astronaut frame) ≈ 163,000.02 years / 1961.17 ≈ 83.11 years\n\nSince the astronaut was 22 years old at the start of the journey, their age upon arrival at Earth would be:\n\n*   **Age at arrival = Initial Age + Time passed for astronaut**\n*   Age at arrival ≈ 22 + 83.11 ≈ 105.11 years\n\nThe average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, so the astronaut will survive the journey. The duration of the trip from the astronaut's perspective is approximately 83 years. This value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
