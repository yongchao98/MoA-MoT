    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before it colloutes with another particle. The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1 (Gas Molecule Mean Free Path):**\n    *   This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   In this case, both the moving particle and the target particles are identical gas molecules with a distribution of velocities.\n    *   The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)**\n    *   Here, σ_gas is the kinetic collision cross-section of the gas molecules (related to the molecule's physical size), and 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules. The √2 factor is included to account for the fact that the target molecules are also in motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron Mean Free Path):**\n    *   This refers to the average distance a high-energy electron from the beam travels before scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   The scenario involves a beam of high-velocity electrons hitting relatively stationary target gas molecules. Since the 1000 kV electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, the thermal motion of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison.\n    *   Therefore, the √2 factor is not used. The formula is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e)**\n    *   Here, 'n' is the same number density of gas molecules, and σ_e is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gas vs. σ_e):**\n    *   **σ_gas** represents a \"hard-sphere\" collision based on the physical diameter of the molecule's electron cloud.\n    *   **σ_e**, the electron scattering cross-section, is different. The interaction is electromagnetic. A very high-energy (1000 kV) electron is a tiny, fast-moving particle. It can pass through the electron cloud of a gas molecule with little to no interaction. Significant scattering only occurs from a close encounter with the atomic nucleus.\n    *   For high-energy electrons, the scattering cross-section (σ_e) is considerably smaller than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecule (σ_gas). The probability of a high-energy electron scattering is lower than the probability of two bulky molecules bumping into each other.\n\n5.  **Determine the Relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Let's look at the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)]\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gas) / (n * σ_e)\n        **λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas / σ_e)**\n    *   Since √2 ≈ 1.414 and we've established that for high-energy electrons σ_gas > σ_e, the ratio (σ_gas / σ_e) is greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than √2 (or ~1.414).\n    *   This leads to the conclusion that **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This contradicts our finding that λ2 should be greater than 1.414*λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. The electron's mean free path is longer, not shorter.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1...: This is incorrect as the underlying physics of the collisions are different.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is the only option consistent with the physical analysis. Our derived relationship (λ2 > 1.414*λ1) satisfies the condition λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.\n\nBased on the analysis, the mean free path for high-energy electrons scattering off gas molecules (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path for gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1).\n\n<<<D>>>"
