    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   **Volume of the solution:**\n    *   200.00 cm³ = 200.00 mL = 0.200 L\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n\nThe solution is a buffer composed of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This system is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (Ka₂).\n\nThe equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThe equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * 1.308\n[H⁺] = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n\nThe concentration of orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the HPO₄²⁻ ion.\n\nThe equilibrium is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThe equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nNow, we can rearrange this formula to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
