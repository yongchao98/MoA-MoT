    "### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n*   **Tautomerism** involves the migration of a proton, typically from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, creating an enol. This requires the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons have hydrogen atoms, but they are vinylic hydrogens, not alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon. Removing these hydrogens is difficult, and the resulting structure would be highly unstable due to ring strain. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has CH₂ groups at the 2, 4, and 6 positions. These carbons are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups and have acidic alpha-hydrogens. The molecule readily undergoes tautomerization to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound. Because the equilibrium strongly favors the aromatic enol form, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is considered to exhibit tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's examine the second carbon atom. It is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. It is a planar molecule due to the carbon-carbon double bond. It possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive. While it exhibits geometric (cis/trans) isomerism, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining the conclusions:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
