    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the two specified points in the titration.\n\n### **1. Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after being diluted with water.\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n### **2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nThis is the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate. The resulting solution is a buffer containing both acetic acid (HA) and acetate (A⁻).\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:** The pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka).\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ **4.73**\n2.  **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** For a buffer solution, the pH is calculated using this equation.\n    pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base (A⁻).\n    *   This leaves 75% of the acid (HA) unreacted.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻] / [HA] is therefore 25% / 75%, which simplifies to 1/3.\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate. The solution now contains only the conjugate base (acetate ion, CH₃COO⁻), which will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n1.  **Find the Moles of Acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = **0.001 moles** of acetic acid.\n2.  **Find the Volume of NaOH needed:** At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = **10.00 cm³** of NaOH.\n3.  **Calculate the Concentration of Acetate:** The total volume is the sum of the diluted acid volume and the added NaOH volume.\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Acetate Concentration [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n4.  **Calculate Kb for Acetate:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, so we need its base dissociation constant (Kb).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw is the ion-product constant for water (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ **5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰**\n5.  **Calculate Hydroxide Concentration [OH⁻]:** The hydrolysis reaction is CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We can find the [OH⁻] using the Kb expression.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02\n    [OH⁻]² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ **3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M**\n6.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48\n    **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH values are approximately **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<C>>>"
