    "The reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Based on established principles of reactivity, we can determine the resulting product by following a logical sequence of steps.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism:**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide. The given R/S descriptors define its specific three-dimensional structure.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates attack epoxides at the less sterically hindered carbon atom. In the given bicyclic system, the epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to four other non-hydrogen atoms), making it highly hindered. C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to three non-hydrogen atoms and one hydrogen), which is significantly less hindered. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n    *   **Stereospecificity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism, which results in a \"backside attack\". This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the carbon-oxygen bond, leading to an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Course of the Reaction:**\n\n*   **Inversion at C6:** The starting material has an S configuration at C6. Due to the Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile, this center will undergo inversion, resulting in an R configuration in the product.\n*   **Retention at Other Centers:** The reaction does not involve breaking or forming bonds at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4). Therefore, their absolute configurations remain unchanged. C1 stays R, C3 stays R, and C4 stays R. Note that while the 3D arrangement at C1 is unchanged, its R/S descriptor could theoretically change if the priority of its neighboring groups changes. However, a detailed analysis shows the priority order of the substituents around C1 does not change, thus it remains R.\n\n**3. Structure and Nomenclature of the Product:**\n\n*   **Ring Opening:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond, opening the epoxide ring. Subsequent protonation (assumed in the workup step) of the resulting alkoxide at C1 yields a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Renaming:** The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents, the ring is numbered towards the newly added methyl group. This leads to the following correspondence between the old and new numbering:\n    *   Old C1 → New C1 (has -OH and a methyl group)\n    *   Old C6 → New C2 (has the newly added methyl group)\n    *   Old C4 → New C4 (has a methyl group)\n    *   Old C3 → New C5 (has a methyl group)\n*   **Final Product Name:** Based on the retention and inversion of stereocenters, the product's configuration is:\n    *   **New C1** (from Old C1) remains **R**.\n    *   **New C2** (from Old C6) inverts from S to **R**.\n    *   **New C4** (from Old C4) remains **R**.\n    *   **New C5** (from Old C3) remains **R**.\n\nCombining these elements, the final product is identified as **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
