    "To determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting neutral hydrogen clouds via their Lyman-alpha absorption with ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based observations.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) Wavelength:** The Lyα spectral line is a transition of the electron in a hydrogen atom from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level. Its rest wavelength (λ₀) is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nm. This wavelength falls in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation. Ground-based telescopes can only detect light at wavelengths that can penetrate the atmosphere. This atmospheric cutoff occurs at approximately 3200-3500 Å (320-350 nm). Observations below this wavelength range require space-based telescopes.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** For the Lyα absorption line to be detectable from the ground, it must be redshifted from its original UV wavelength into the visible part of the spectrum, i.e., to a wavelength longer than the atmospheric cutoff. The relationship between rest wavelength (λ₀), observed wavelength (λ_obs), and redshift (z) is given by the formula: `λ_obs = λ₀ * (1 + z)`.\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the atmospheric cutoff limit. Using a conservative value for the cutoff at the bluer end of the optical window, around 3500 Å, we can calculate the required redshift:\n\n*   λ_obs = 3500 Å\n*   λ₀ = 1216 Å\n\nUsing the formula `z = (λ_obs / λ₀) - 1`:\n\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculation shows that a redshift of approximately 1.88 is needed to shift the 1216 Å Lyα line to 3500 Å, making it observable with a ground-based telescope. This value is very close to 1.9. Therefore, quasars must have a redshift of at least this value for their light absorbed by intervening hydrogen clouds to be detected from the ground. Studies of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) often focus on redshift ranges like 1.9 < z < 3.5 for this reason.\n\n<<<C>>>"
