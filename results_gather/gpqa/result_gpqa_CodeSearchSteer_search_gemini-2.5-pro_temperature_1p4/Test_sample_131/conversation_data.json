    "To definitively solve this problem, a systematic analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectra for each potential compound is required. This theoretical analysis is then compared against the provided spectral data of the 1:1 mixture.\n\n### **Analysis of Individual Compounds**\n\nThe molecular formula for all candidate compounds is C10H14. We must determine the number and type of signals each would produce in a 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, this molecule has only two unique types of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. This results in a single signal (a singlet) for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also equivalent, leading to another single signal (a singlet) for 12H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and one alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent, producing one singlet for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent to each other, but not to the first pair. This gives two distinct singlets, each integrating to 6H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and two alkyl singlets (6H each, 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also possesses symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two aromatic protons which are chemically equivalent, resulting in one singlet for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups. The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H), the methyl at C2 is unique (3H), and the methyl at C5 is unique (3H). This produces three distinct singlets.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and three alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one singlet for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the two equivalent ethyl groups are not equivalent. The -CH2- (methylene) protons will appear as a quartet (4H) and the -CH3 (methyl) protons will appear as a triplet (6H) due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** One aromatic singlet (4H), one alkyl quartet (4H), and one alkyl triplet (6H). This is inconsistent with the data provided, which states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n### **Analysis of the Mixture**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on combining the spectra of the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-TMB provides another 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in **two singlets of a 1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets. If all three signals have unique chemical shifts, the combined spectrum would show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This pair can be immediately ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, which contradicts the observation of only singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both compounds give a 2H singlet, leading to two singlets in a 1:1 ratio in the mixture. This is consistent.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combination would produce four singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:3:3 (or 4:2:1:1). This does not match the observed three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both compounds give a 2H singlet, leading to two singlets in a 1:1 ratio in the mixture. This is consistent.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combination would result in up to five singlets. Even with potential overlap, it is unlikely to produce three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. For example, if one 6H signal from each compound overlapped, the ratio would be 12:6:3:3 (4:2:1:1). This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
