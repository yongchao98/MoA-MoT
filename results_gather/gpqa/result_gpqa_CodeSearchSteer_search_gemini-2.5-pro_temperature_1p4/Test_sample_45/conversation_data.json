    "The olefin metathesis reaction involves the \"swapping\" of the groups attached to the carbons of a double bond. When a single terminal alkene undergoes this reaction, called self-metathesis, it reacts with itself. This reaction is catalyzed by catalysts like the Grubbs catalyst and typically results in a symmetrical internal alkene and ethene gas (CH2=CH2). The formation of volatile ethene helps to drive the reaction to completion.\n\nThe reactant is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center, meaning the molecule can exist as two different enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The problem states that the starting material is a racemic mixture, which is a 1:1 mixture of the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\nDue to the racemic nature of the starting material, three different reaction pairings can occur:\n1.  Metathesis between two molecules of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n2.  Metathesis between two molecules of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n3.  Cross-metathesis between one molecule of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and one molecule of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe main product, aside from ethene, will have the structure of 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This product molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons 3 and 6) and a central double bond that can exist in either a cis (Z) or trans (E) configuration.\n\nLet's analyze the products from each pairing:\n*   **(R) + (R) reaction:** This pairing produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. Because of the central double bond, this can exist as two different molecules (diastereomers): the (E) isomer and the (Z) isomer.\n*   **(S) + (S) reaction:** This pairing produces (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. This also exists as two diastereomers: the (E) isomer and the (Z) isomer. The (E)-(S,S) product is the enantiomer (mirror image) of the (E)-(R,R) product, and the (Z)-(S,S) product is the enantiomer of the (Z)-(R,R) product. This gives us a total of four distinct stereoisomers so far.\n*   **(R) + (S) reaction:** This cross-reaction produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene. In this molecule, the two chiral centers have opposite configurations. Because the substituents on both chiral centers are identical, this results in meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers. This configuration can also exist as two different diastereomers due to the central double bond: the (E)-(3R,6S) isomer and the (Z)-(3R,6S) isomer. Both of these are distinct meso compounds.\n\nIn total, counting all the possible unique stereoisomers gives:\n1.  (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n2.  (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n3.  (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n4.  (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n5.  (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n6.  (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n\nTherefore, there are 6 possible products excluding ethene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
