    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation:\n\n1.  **Assumptions**: The problem states we can assume the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population of atomic energy levels.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (N₂) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N₁) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Two Stars**: We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let's denote the ratio (N₂/N₁) for star 1 as R₁ and for star 2 as R₂.\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T₁): R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T₂): R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n    Since we are considering the same transition of iron atoms in both stars, the values for ΔE, g₂, and g₁ are identical for both equations.\n\n4.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This means the ratio of the populations in star 1 is double the ratio in star 2:\n    R₁ = 2 * R₂\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations**: Now we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4:\n    (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    The term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out from both sides:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n6.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To solve this, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x, we get:\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\n    Factor out the constant term (ΔE / k):\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n7.  **Considering the Numerical Values**: The problem gives the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. This choice of values is intentional, as it simplifies the constant term:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    ln(2) ≈ (1 K) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n    Looking at the provided options, it is common in physics problems of this type to omit the constant factor with its units for simplicity, focusing on the relationship between the variables. If we omit the \"(1 K)\" factor, the equation becomes:\n    ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n    This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
