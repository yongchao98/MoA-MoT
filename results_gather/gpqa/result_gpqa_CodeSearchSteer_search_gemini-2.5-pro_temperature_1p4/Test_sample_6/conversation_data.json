    "To determine the energy at which high-energy gamma-rays ($\\gamma$) have their lifetimes limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for this process.\n\n### The Physics of Pair Production\n\nThe process in question is the creation of an electron-positron pair from the collision of two photons:\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The electron and positron have identical rest masses. The rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV. Therefore, the minimum energy required to create the pair is $2 \\times m_e c^2$.\n\n### Threshold Energy Calculation\n\nLet:\n*   $E$ be the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $\\epsilon$ be the energy of the CMB photon.\n*   $m_e c^2$ be the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\nThe threshold condition for pair production is most favorably met in a head-on collision. The invariant mass squared ($s$) for the two-photon system is given by $s = 2E\\epsilon(1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the photons. For a head-on collision ($\\theta = \\pi$), this simplifies to $s = 4E\\epsilon$.\n\nAt the threshold, this invariant mass energy is just enough to create the electron-positron pair at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\nSo, the threshold condition is:\n$s = (2 m_e c^2)^2$\n$4E\\epsilon = (2 m_e c^2)^2$\n$E = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon}$\n\n### Plugging in the Values\n\nWe are given:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nFirst, let's ensure all units are consistent. We will convert everything to electron-volts (eV).\n*   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n*   $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the threshold energy $E$ for the high-energy gamma-ray:\n$E = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E = \\frac{(0.511)^2 \\times (10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n$E = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n$E = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe options are given in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$. Let's convert our result to GeV:\n$E = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is very close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
