    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for them.\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇⋅B) is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles. If monopoles existed, they would act as sources or \"sinks\" for the magnetic field, just as electric charges do for the electric field. Therefore, the divergence of B would be proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρm), and the equation would no longer be zero.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇×E). If magnetic monopoles exist, a current of these monopoles (a \"magnetic current,\" Jm) would also create a circulating electric field. To account for this, an additional term representing the magnetic current would be added to Faraday's law.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<C>>>"
