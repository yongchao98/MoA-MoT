    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates and identify the system it describes.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) is given by the relations:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nFrom which we can derive:\nr² = x² + y²\nx² = r² cos²(θ)\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy equation gives:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. It is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x²\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/2 k_q q² is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k_q/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is k_x = 4k.\nThe angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\nThe energy for the x-component is E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m).\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is k_y = k.\nThe angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m).\nThe energy for the y-component is E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators.\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
