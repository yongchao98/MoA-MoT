    "My initial analysis was based on established principles of astrophysics, which the search results confirm.\n\n*   **Transit Probability:** The probability of an exoplanet transiting its star, for a circular orbit, is approximated by the ratio of the stellar radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). This confirms the formula P_transit ≈ R_s / a.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s). The relationship can be expressed as P² ∝ a³ / M_s. This confirms that to find the semi-major axis, we can use the relation a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3).\n\nMy step-by-step derivation based on these principles was as follows:\n\n1.  **Probability Ratio:** The ratio of the transit probabilities of Planet_1 (P_t1) and Planet_2 (P_t2) is given by:\n    P_t1 / P_t2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n\n2.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Radius of host star 1 (R_s1) = Radius of host star 2 (R_s2)\n    *   Orbital period of Planet_1 (P1) = Orbital period of Planet_2 (P2) / 3\n    *   Mass of host star 1 (M_s1) = 2 * Mass of host star 2 (M_s2)\n\n3.  **Simplification:** Since R_s1 = R_s2, the probability ratio simplifies to:\n    P_t1 / P_t2 = a2 / a1\n\n4.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:** We know that a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    a2 / a1 = [(M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²)]^(1/3)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Substitution:** Substituting the known relationships:\n    *   M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2\n    *   P2 / P1 = 3\n    a2 / a1 = (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    a2 / a1 = (3² / 2)^(1/3) = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n    a2 / a1 ≈ 1.65096\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This aligns with option D.\n\nThe search results have validated the physical laws used in the derivation. No new information has contradicted the initial line of reasoning. The calculation is straightforward and leads directly to one of the multiple-choice answers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
