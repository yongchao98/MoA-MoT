    "To determine the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x`, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators in their matrix representations.\n\nThe given spin state is a linear superposition:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nIn the standard basis where the spin-up state `|↑⟩` is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]` and the spin-down state `|↓⟩` is represented by `[0, 1]`, the state vector `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]^T + (√3)/2 * [0, 1]^T = [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` are defined as follows:\n*   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe operator in question is `Ô = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. We can construct its matrix representation:\n`Ô = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`Ô = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\n`Ô = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `Ô` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated by the formula `⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩`. First, we find the bra vector `⟨ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. Since the components are real, it is the row vector `[0.5, √3/2]`.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n`⟨Ô⟩ = ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\nAlternatively, due to the linearity of the expectation value, we can calculate the expectation values for `σ_z` and `σ_x` separately and then combine them.\n\n1.  **Expectation value of `σ_z`:**\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n    `= [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]^T`\n    `= (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n2.  **Expectation value of `σ_x`:**\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n    `= [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\n    `= (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n3.  **Combine the results:**\n    `⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10 * ⟨σ_z⟩ + 5 * ⟨σ_x⟩`\n    `= 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n    `= -5 + 2.5√3`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value. Using the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨Ô⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
