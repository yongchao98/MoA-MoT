    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations rests on a set of simplifying assumptions about how a probe (like a lepton) interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus. The core idea is to treat the complex, many-body interaction as a much simpler, quasi-free, single-particle event.\n\nBased on an analysis of the provided options, the key assumptions are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is often referred to as the \"one-body current\" assumption. It posits that the probe interacts with a single nucleon at a time, ignoring more complex interactions like meson exchange currents where the probe interacts with the force-carrying particles between nucleons. This is a foundational element, framing the event as a one-on-one interaction.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption, often part of what is known as the \"Plane Wave Impulse Approximation\" (PWIA), means that neither the incoming probe nor the struck, outgoing nucleon interacts with the other (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus. In reality, these \"final-state interactions\" (FSI) are significant, and more advanced models like the Distorted-Wave Impulse Approximation (DWIA) attempt to account for them. However, in its most basic form, the impulse approximation assumes their absence.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is central to the concept. During the brief moment of the high-energy interaction, the nucleon is treated as a free particle, not subject to the nuclear potential that normally binds it within the nucleus. The weak binding energy of some nuclei is cited as a reason this approximation can be useful. While the nucleon has a momentum distribution due to its confinement (Fermi motion), the binding energy itself is considered negligible compared to the energy transferred in the interaction.\n\nThe third option presented in the question, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While the behavior of quarks and gluons determines the nucleon's properties, the impulse approximation is concerned with the behavior of the nucleon *as a whole* within the nuclear medium, not its internal quark-gluon dynamics. Therefore, this is not a core assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\nCombining the essential components leads to the conclusion that assumptions 1, 2, and 4 jointly define the impulse approximation in its idealized form.\n\n<<<A>>>"
