    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the electron-positron annihilation process. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Initial State Energy and Momentum**\n\nFirst, we determine the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision. The energy (E) and momentum (p) of a relativistic particle are given by:\n\n*   E = γmc²\n*   p = γmv\n\nwhere 'm' is the rest mass of the particle, 'c' is the speed of light, 'γ' is the Lorentz factor, and 'v' is the velocity. The velocity can be found from the Lorentz factor: v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).\n\n*   **Electron (from the left, +x direction):**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Energy (E_e) = 4mc²\n    *   Velocity (v_e) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4²) = c * sqrt(15)/4\n    *   Momentum (p_e) = 4 * m * (c * sqrt(15)/4) = mc * sqrt(15)\n\n*   **Positron (from the right, -x direction):**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Energy (E_p) = 2mc²\n    *   Velocity (v_p) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/2²) = c * sqrt(3)/2\n    *   Momentum (p_p) = -2 * m * (c * sqrt(3)/2) = -mc * sqrt(3) (negative due to its direction)\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy:**\n    *   E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (along the horizontal axis):**\n    *   p_initial = p_e + p_p = mc * sqrt(15) - mc * sqrt(3) = mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\n**2. Final State Energy and Momentum**\n\nThe annihilation produces two photons of equal energy.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:**\n    The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons (E_γ).\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   6mc² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is E_γ = 3mc².\n\n*   **Momentum of Each Photon:**\n    The magnitude of a photon's momentum is its energy divided by the speed of light.\n    *   p_γ = E_γ / c = 3mc\n\n**3. Determining the Angle**\n\nWe use the conservation of momentum to find the angle. Since the initial momentum is only along the horizontal (x) axis, the vertical (y) components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Given that the photons have equal energy (and thus equal momentum magnitude), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation (horizontal axis):**\n    The initial horizontal momentum must equal the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta.\n    *   p_initial = p_final_x\n    *   mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2p_γ * cos(θ)\n\n*   **Solving for the angle θ:**\n    We can now substitute the value of p_γ and solve for cos(θ).\n    *   mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ)\n    *   mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6mc * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n*   **Calculating the numerical value:**\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n\n*   **Angle between photons** = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<C>>>"
