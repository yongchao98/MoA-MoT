    "Here is a breakdown of the immunological processes to identify the correct one:\n\n*   **The Experiment:** You have introduced a viral antigen (rotavirus protein) orally. This antigen has been taken up by Peyer's patches, which are the primary inductive sites for immune responses in the gut. In these Peyer's patches, you observe a population of proliferating cells. This indicates an active immune response. Crucially, sequencing reveals high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of these cells.\n\n*   **V(D)J Recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors *before* a B cell encounters an antigen. It occurs as B cells develop in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ). The scenario described takes place in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) *after* antigen stimulation, so V(D)J recombination has already occurred and is not the process causing the observed variability in these proliferating cells.\n\n*   **Somatic Hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs in activated B cells within structures called germinal centers, which are found in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. SHM introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates variants of the original B cell receptor. B cells that acquire mutations leading to higher affinity for the antigen are selected to proliferate, a process known as affinity maturation. The \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating cell population in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the definitive hallmark of SHM.\n\n*   **Class Switching Recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often concurrently with SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switch alters the antibody's effector function (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in mucosal responses) without changing its antigen-binding specificity. Therefore, it does not account for the high variability in the *variable* gene segment.\n\n*   **Complement Activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve the genetic modification of B cells and is unrelated to generating antibody diversity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating lymphocytes in Peyer's patches after oral antigen administration is a direct description of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
