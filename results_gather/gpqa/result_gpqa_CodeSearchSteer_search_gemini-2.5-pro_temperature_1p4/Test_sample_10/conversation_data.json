    "Upon reviewing the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2, the following analysis determines the incorrect statement:\n\n**A) Correct.** Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein induces apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This activation occurs without a change in the expression levels of Bcl-2, which is a crucial regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. This evidence strongly indicates that ORF3a triggers apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic pathway.\n\n**B) Correct.** Research has established a linear relationship between the in vitro rate of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting and the conformational plasticity of the RNA pseudoknot. The frameshift signals of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are known to adopt two main conformations when subjected to tension, a characteristic they share with other pseudoknots that exhibit comparable rates of frameshifting.\n\n**C) Correct.** Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is a crucial mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. It involves the ribosome slipping back by one nucleotide at a specific \"slippery site\" on the viral RNA. This event is facilitated by a complex downstream RNA structure called a pseudoknot. This frameshift allows for the continued translation past the ORF1a stop codon, resulting in the production of a large fusion polyprotein called pp1ab, in addition to the pp1a polyprotein. The frameshifting RNA elements of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are structurally and functionally very similar, with small-angle X-ray scattering analyses indicating they share the same conformation.\n\n**D) Incorrect.** The nsp10/nsp14 complex is a critical component of the virus's replication machinery, operating as a heterodimer. The nsp14 protein contains an N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain that provides a proofreading, or mismatch repair, function. Nsp10 acts as a cofactor, binding to nsp14 and stimulating its exonuclease activity. However, the function of this complex is to *excise* or *hydrolyze* mismatched nucleotides from the 3' end of a newly synthesized RNA strand, which involves the controlled breakdown of the dsRNA at the site of the error. The statement that the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA is incorrect; its proofreading function is accomplished *through* targeted degradation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
