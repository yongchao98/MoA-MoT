    "The analysis of the problem proceeds in two parts: determining the angular distribution of the radiated power and its dependence on the wavelength.\n\n### 1. Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nAn oscillating charge distribution, regardless of its precise shape, will radiate. For a distribution that is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation (λ), the dominant form of radiation is electric dipole radiation. A spheroid shape with oscillation along its symmetry axis (the z-axis) will, in the far-field (radiation zone), behave as a simple oscillating electric dipole.\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n\n*   dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe maximum radiated power, A, occurs when sin²(θ) is at its maximum value of 1. This happens at θ = 90°, which is perpendicular to the axis of oscillation.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle θ = 30°, we calculate the value of sin²(30°):\n\n*   sin(30°) = 1/2\n*   sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\n### 2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴) of the oscillation. This relationship is fundamental to processes like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\nThe angular frequency (ω) is related to the wavelength (λ) by the equation:\n\n*   ω = 2πc / λ\n\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the radiated power (P) has the following dependence on the wavelength:\n\n*   P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴\n\nThis means the function f, which describes the radiated power, will have a λ⁻⁴ dependence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power (A) radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4, and the functional form of the power's dependence on wavelength is λ⁻⁴.\n\nThis corresponds to option A. It's worth noting that if the electric dipole moment of the distribution were zero, higher-order radiation like magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole would become dominant. However, for a simple oscillating spheroid, electric dipole radiation is the primary component.\n\n<<<A>>>"
