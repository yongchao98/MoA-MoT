    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. We can determine its general formula.\n    -   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2). This does not yield a simple integer solution for n.\n    -   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    -   1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n    We are also told that Z is a component of mixture Y, is widely used as a solvent, and is formed by the hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the formula CnH2n for n=6. Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y:**\n    -   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or unreactive like aromatic rings.\n    -   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components.\n    -   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    -   A plausible candidate for the second component is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n    -   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Characterize the Reaction and Mixture X:**\n    -   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) upon heating with platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation, a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    -   The formation of an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) from an equimolar mixture of two compounds (X1 and X2) can be represented by the following hydrogen transfer reaction:\n        X1 + X2 → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    -   By balancing the atoms, the total composition of X1 and X2 must be C12H18. Since both X1 and X2 must have the same carbon skeleton (a C6 ring, as they hydrogenate to cyclohexane), their formulas must be C6Ha and C6Hb where a + b = 18.\n    -   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components (X1 and X2) are unsaturated (contain double bonds). They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    -   The condition that there are no conjugated multiple bonds rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    -   Let's test the pair of a=10 and b=8. This corresponds to X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). To meet the non-conjugated bond condition, this must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    -   The proposed disproportionation reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    -   This reaction is chemically sound; the cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, with platinum serving as the catalyst for hydrogen transfer. Both components of X, cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, would decolorize bromine water and would hydrogenate to form only cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    -   The two liquids constituting mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    -   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in their formulas.\n    -   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
