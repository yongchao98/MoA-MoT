    "To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the energy uncertainty, or \"broadening,\" of each level. This energy broadening is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a state (ΔE) multiplied by the lifetime of that state (Δt) is approximately equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n\nThe formula is:\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each quantum state:\n\n1.  **For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁹ seconds (τ₁):**\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁸ seconds (τ₂):**\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This is the dominant factor for resolving the two levels. For the levels to be clearly distinguished, their energy separation must be significantly larger than this broadening.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the larger energy uncertainty of ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is also smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is significantly smaller than the required energy separation.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is about 1,000 times larger than the energy uncertainty of the broader state (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), allowing the two levels to be clearly resolved.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two levels can be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
