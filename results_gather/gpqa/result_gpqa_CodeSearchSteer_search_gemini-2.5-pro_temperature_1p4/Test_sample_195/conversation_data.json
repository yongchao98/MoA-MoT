    "The derivation is based on the principle of conservation of energy, adapted for special relativity.\n\n1.  **Total Relativistic Energy**: The total energy ($E$) of a particle of rest mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. This total energy includes the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the relativistic kinetic energy. For the harmonic oscillator system, we must also include the potential energy ($U$) from the spring, which is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. The total conserved energy of the system is therefore $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude**: The maximum amplitude ($A$) is the point where the mass momentarily stops to change direction. At this point, the velocity $v=0$. Consequently, the relativistic factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$. The total energy of the system at $x=A$ is purely the sum of the rest energy and the maximum potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n3.  **Energy at Maximum Speed**: The maximum speed ($v_{max}$) occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$). At this point, the potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$. The total energy is now entirely in the form of the particle's relativistic energy (rest energy + kinetic energy):\n    $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n4.  **Conservation of Energy**: Since the total energy of the system is conserved, we can equate the expressions for the total energy at the two points:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n5.  **Solving for Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**:\n    *   Divide by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
