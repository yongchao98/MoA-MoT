    "Based on the principles of electrochemistry, the correct completion of the statement is:\n\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation:\n\n**1. Thermodynamic Aspect: Strength of the Oxidant**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.\n\n*   **In acidic solution**, the reduction of oxygen is represented by the half-reaction:\n    O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with a standard potential of **E° = +1.23 V**.\n*   **In basic solution**, the half-reaction is:\n    O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with a standard potential of **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\nSince the standard reduction potential is significantly less positive in basic solution (+0.40 V) compared to acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen has a lower tendency to be reduced. This means oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n**2. Kinetic Aspect: Reaction Speed**\n\nKinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. While thermodynamically favorable, the reduction of oxygen is known to be a kinetically slow process, often requiring a significant overpotential to proceed at a reasonable rate.\n\nWhen comparing the two environments, research indicates that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is generally slower in acidic media than in alkaline (basic) media. Studies have shown that alkaline conditions can promote faster electron transfer kinetics for the ORR compared to acidic environments. Therefore, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nCombining these two points leads to the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
