    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use the relationships between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its orbital distance, and its orbital period.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (Teq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius (a), assuming the planet orbits the same star and has the same albedo.\n    *   Teq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit.\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the orbital radius and the equilibrium temperature from the first principle:\n*   Teq₁ / Teq₂ = √(a₂ / a₁)\n*   (Teq₁ / Teq₂)² = a₂ / a₁\n\nNext, we use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital radii:\n*   Given: Teq₁ / Teq₂ ≈ 1.4\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   Given: Teq₂ / Teq₃ ≈ 2.3\n    *   a₃ / a₂ = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the orbital radius of Planet3 to Planet1:\n*   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁)\n*   a₃ / a₁ = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\nFinally, we use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n*   (P₃ / P₁)² = (a₃ / a₁ )³\n*   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n*   P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n*   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThis result is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planet masses, the specific albedo value (as long as it is equal for all planets), and the TTV discovery method are not needed for this particular calculation.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of about 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
