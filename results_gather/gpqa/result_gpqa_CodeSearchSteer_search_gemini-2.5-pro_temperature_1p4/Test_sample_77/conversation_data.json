    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the field experienced at an observation point **r** at time *t* was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *t*<sub>r</sub>.\n\nThe correct expressions must depend on the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at this retarded time. The scalar and vector potentials are given by the following formulas:\n\nThe scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{d}| - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nThe vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. Substituting the expression for V and using the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we can write the vector potential as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}| - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of these expressions by *c*:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{|\\vec{d}|c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{d}|c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nUsing the problem's notation where $d = |\\vec{d}|$, these expressions become:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese formulas precisely match option B. The denominator term, $(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, is a crucial component that arises from evaluating the effect of the moving source at the retarded time. Options A and C are incorrect because they use the static potential form, which does not account for the charge's motion or retardation effects. Option D is incorrect due to the positive sign in the denominator, which is inconsistent with the Liénard-Wiechert formulation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
