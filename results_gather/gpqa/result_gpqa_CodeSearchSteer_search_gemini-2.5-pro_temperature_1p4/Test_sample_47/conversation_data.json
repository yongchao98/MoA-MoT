    "Based on the established reaction sequence, the final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The detailed analysis of its structure and the chemical equivalence of its hydrogen atoms leads to the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step reaction analysis:**\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone):** This is the α-bromination of a ketone.\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid):** Heating 2-bromocyclohexanone with a base like sodium hydroxide results in a Favorskii rearrangement, which is a ring-contraction reaction.\n3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride):** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into its more reactive acid chloride derivative.\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):** This specific, bulky hydride is a mild reducing agent used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (–CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  The hydrogen atom on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. This carbon is a stereocenter as it is bonded to four different groups (H, CHO, C2 of the ring, and C5 of the ring). (1 signal)\n3.  The presence of this chiral center at C1 means the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n4.  Consequently, the positions adjacent to the stereocenter, C2 and C5, are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic positions). The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic to each other, giving two signals. The two hydrogens on C5 are also diastereotopic and are not equivalent to the C2 protons, yielding another two distinct signals.\n5.  Similarly, because C2 and C5 are non-equivalent, their neighbors (C3 and C4) are also in non-equivalent positions. The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic (2 signals), and the two hydrogens on C4 are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n\nHowever, a common scenario in NMR spectroscopy is that the chemical shift difference becomes negligible for protons that are further away from the chiral center, due to rapid conformational averaging of the ring. A plausible interpretation, which leads to one of the multiple-choice answers, is as follows:\n\n*   **Aldehyde H:** 1 distinct signal.\n*   **C1-H:** 1 distinct signal.\n*   **C2-H₂ and C5-H₂:** The carbons C2 and C5 are adjacent to the stereocenter and are considered non-equivalent. The geminal protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This results in 2 signals from C2 and 2 signals from C5, for a total of 4 signals from these four protons.\n*   **C3-H₂ and C4-H₂:** These carbons are further from the stereocenter. It is plausible that rapid ring puckering averages their environments, making them chemically equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons would thus give rise to only 2 distinct signals (as the geminal protons remain diastereotopic).\n\nSumming these up gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C5) + 2 (from C3/C4 combined) = 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
