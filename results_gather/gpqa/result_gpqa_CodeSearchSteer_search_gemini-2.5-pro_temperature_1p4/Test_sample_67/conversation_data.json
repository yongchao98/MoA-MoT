    "### Oscillation Frequency Determined by Larmor Precession\n\nWhen a spin-1/2 particle, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, is suddenly subjected to a magnetic field of the same magnitude (B) in the +Y direction, the z-component of its magnetic moment will oscillate. This oscillation is a direct consequence of a phenomenon known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this oscillation is given by the product of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) and the magnetic field strength (B).\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is **γB**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's spin is aligned with the Z-axis, meaning it is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-direction.\n2.  **New Dynamics**: When the magnetic field is switched to the Y-axis, the particle's magnetic moment experiences a torque. This torque causes the spin vector not to align with the new field, but to precess (or wobble) around it. This is analogous to a spinning top precessing in a gravitational field.\n3.  **Hamiltonian and Time Evolution**: The system's evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian H = -μ · B = -γB * S_y, where S_y is the spin operator for the y-component. Solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation shows that the initial \"spin-up\" state evolves into a superposition of \"spin-up\" and \"spin-down\" states.\n4.  **Expectation Value**: The average, or expectation value, of the z-component of the magnetic moment (<μz>) is then calculated as a function of time. This calculation reveals that <μz> oscillates.\n5.  **Larmor Frequency**: The resulting equation for the expectation value is of the form <μz>(t) ∝ cos(γBt). The angular frequency of this oscillation, known as the Larmor frequency, is ω = γB. This frequency is fundamental in applications like Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\nThe calculation confirms that the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to γB. The fact that the initial state was aligned along the Z-axis and the new field is along the Y-axis causes the z-component's expectation value to vary, tracing a cosine function with this specific frequency.\n\n<<<B>>>"
