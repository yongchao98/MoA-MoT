    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   A_p is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4)]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A_p1 = A_p2). Therefore, most terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a1)^(-1/2) / (a2)^(-1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Parameters:** We need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1). The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ), which relates to the star's RV semi-amplitude (K). For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass M_p is much less than the star's mass M_star), the star's RV semi-amplitude is:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    Since the planets are detected by the transit method, their orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    Substituting v_p into the equation for K:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² = (M_p² / M_star) * (G / a)\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n7.  **Calculate the Necessary Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ). Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substitute Ratios to find a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
