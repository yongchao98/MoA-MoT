    "To determine the correct option, we will first find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and then assess the renormalizability of the theory based on that dimension.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension of κ\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action, S, is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over four-dimensional spacetime: S = ∫d⁴x L.\n\n*   The spacetime volume element d⁴x has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = -4, since position and time have a mass dimension of -1.\n*   For the action S to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of [L] = 4.\n\nThe given interaction Lagrangian is  L<sub>int</sub> = κψ̄σ<sub>μν</sub>ψF<sup>μν</sup>. The total dimension of this term must be 4. To find the dimension of κ, we must first determine the dimensions of the fields ψ and F<sup>μν</sup> and the term σ<sub>μν</sub>.\n\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion is L<sub>fermion</sub> = iψ̄γ<sup>μ</sup>∂<sub>μ</sub>ψ. For this term to have a dimension of 4, we have [ψ̄][ψ][∂<sub>μ</sub>] = 4. Since [∂<sub>μ</sub>] (a derivative) has a dimension of 1, and [ψ̄] = [ψ], we get 2[ψ] + 1 = 4, which gives [ψ] = 3/2.\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (F<sup>μν</sup>):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is L<sub>EM</sub> = -¼ F<sub>μν</sub>F<sup>μν</sup>. For this to have a dimension of 4, we need 2[F<sup>μν</sup>] = 4, which means [F<sup>μν</sup>] = 2.\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ<sub>μν</sub>):** This term is defined as σ<sub>μν</sub> = (i/2)[γ<sub>μ</sub>,γ<sub>ν</sub>]. The gamma matrices (γ<sub>μ</sub>) are dimensionless constants. Therefore, their commutator, σ<sub>μν</sub>, is also dimensionless, so [σ<sub>μν</sub>] = 0.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass dimension of κ using the interaction term:\n[L<sub>int</sub>] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ<sub>μν</sub>] + [F<sup>μν</sup>] = 4\n[κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 + 2 = 4\n[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4\n[κ] + 5 = 4\n**[κ] = -1**\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by a method called \"power counting\", which relates to the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the Lagrangian.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (it is dimensionless), the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction is **not renormalizable**. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to cancel all divergences, which removes their predictive power at high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
