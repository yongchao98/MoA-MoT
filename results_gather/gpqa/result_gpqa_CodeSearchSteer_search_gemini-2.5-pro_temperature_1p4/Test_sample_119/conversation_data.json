    "The initial derivation is confirmed by the search results. Specifically, the Wikipedia article on Lutz-Kelker bias directly addresses this question.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** We assume that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the stellar density, ρ) is constant.\n\n2.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance *d* from the observer, with a thickness of *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*).\n    *   dV = 4πd² dd\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars (*dN*) in this shell is the stellar density (ρ) times the volume of the shell (*dV*).\n    *   dN = ρ * 4πd² dd\n\n4.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:** Stellar parallax (*plx*) is inversely proportional to distance (*d*). For simplicity in astronomical calculations, the parsec is defined as the distance at which a star has a parallax of one arcsecond. This leads to a simple formula:\n    *   d = 1/plx\n    *   Therefore, plx = 1/d\n\n5.  **Relating Thickness (dd) to Parallax Range (d(plx)):** We need to find how a small range in distance (*dd*) corresponds to a small range in parallax (*d(plx)*). We can do this by taking the derivative of d with respect to plx:\n    *   d = 1/plx\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   Ignoring the negative sign (as we are concerned with magnitudes), we get: dd = d(plx) / plx²\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now, we substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* in terms of *plx* back into our equation for the number of stars, *dN*.\n    *   dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx) / plx²)\n    *   dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is dN/d(plx).\n    *   dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, we can see the final relationship:\n*   The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nThis relationship is also mentioned in the context of the Lutz-Kelker bias, where it is noted that for a uniform stellar distribution, the probability density of the true parallax per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/p⁴ (where p is the true parallax).\n\n<<<B>>>"
