    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we will use the principles of orbital mechanics and transit geometry.\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry of Transits**\nA planet transits its star when its orbit is aligned with our line of sight. The impact parameter, *b*, describes how close the planet's center passes to the star's center in the sky, normalized by the star's radius. The formula for the impact parameter is:\n\n*b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s*\n\nwhere:\n*   *a* is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n*   *i* is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   *R_s* is the radius of the star.\n\n**2. Use Planet 1 to Find the System's Inclination**\nSince both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination *i*. We can use the information from the first planet to find a relationship involving this inclination.\n\nFor Planet 1:\n*   *b1* = 0.2\n*   *a1* is its semi-major axis.\n*   *R_s* is the star's radius.\n\nFrom the impact parameter formula:\n*0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s*\nRearranging this gives us:\n*a1 * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s*\n\n**3. Define the Transit Condition for Planet 2**\nFor the second planet to exhibit a transit, its center must pass over the star's disk. The maximum possible orbital distance (and thus period) for a transit to occur is when the planet's center passes exactly over the star's edge. In this limiting case, the impact parameter *b2* is equal to 1.\n\nFor Planet 2 at its maximum orbital distance (*a2_max*):\n*b2 = 1*\n*1 = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s*\nRearranging this gives us:\n*a2_max * cos(i) = R_s*\n\n**4. Relate the Orbits of the Two Planets**\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  *a1 * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s*\n2.  *a2_max * cos(i) = R_s*\n\nBy dividing the second equation by the first, we can eliminate the unknown inclination (*cos(i)*) and stellar radius (*R_s*):\n*(a2_max * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = R_s / (0.2 * R_s)*\n*a2_max / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5*\n\nThis means the semi-major axis of the second planet's orbit is 5 times larger than that of the first planet.\n\n**5. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*). For two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio is constant:\n*(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³*\n\nWe can now solve for the maximum period of the second planet, *P2_max*:\n*   *P1* = 3 days\n*   *a2_max / a1* = 5\n\n*(P2_max / 3)² = 5³*\n*(P2_max / 3)² = 125*\n*P2_max / 3 = √125*\n*P2_max = 3 * √125*\n*P2_max = 3 * √(25 * 5)*\n*P2_max = 3 * 5 * √5*\n*P2_max = 15 * √5*\n\nCalculating the final value:\n*P2_max ≈ 15 * 2.236 = 33.54* days.\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to transit is approximately 33.5 days. The information about the radii of the two planets was not needed for this specific interpretation of the transit condition.\n\n<<<A>>>"
