    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first identify the color of the light it emits. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is used for this calculation.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The wavelength (λ) can be calculated using the formula λ = hc/E, where a convenient approximation is λ (in nm) ≈ 1240 / E (in eV).\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Color of Emitted Light\nA wavelength of 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Absorbed Color\nThere are two common relationships between absorbed and emitted light:\n\n1.  **Complementary Color for Perceived Color**: When a substance is viewed under white light, the color we perceive is complementary to the color it absorbs most strongly. For a substance that looks green, the absorbed color is red.\n\n2.  **Stokes Shift for Fluorescence**: The process described—absorbing light and then emitting light of a different color—is called fluorescence. In fluorescence, a molecule absorbs a photon, which excites it to a higher energy state. It then loses some energy through non-radiative processes before emitting a new, lower-energy photon. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift. Because the emitted photon has lower energy, it has a longer wavelength than the absorbed photon.\n\nThe emitted light has an energy of 2.3393 eV (green light). According to the principle of Stokes shift, the absorbed light must have a higher energy (and thus a shorter wavelength) than the emitted light.\n\nLet's examine the energy levels of the colors provided in the options:\n*   **Red**: Has the lowest energy and longest wavelength in the visible spectrum (~1.6 to 2.0 eV).\n*   **Yellow**: Has a lower energy than green light.\n*   **Blue**: Has a higher energy and shorter wavelength than green light (~2.5 to 2.75 eV).\n*   **Violet**: Has the highest energy and shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum (~2.75 to 3.1 eV).\n\nSince the absorbed light must be of higher energy than the emitted green light (2.3393 eV), both Red and Yellow are incorrect as they are lower in energy. Blue and Violet are both higher in energy and could be absorbed to cause green fluorescence.\n\nHowever, in the context of dyes and color, the relationship between the perceived color and the absorbed color is often based on complementarity. If the dye appears green because it is emitting green light, the color it absorbs from the environment to create this appearance is its complement. The complementary color to green is red. Given the multiple-choice options, this question is likely referring to the complementary color relationship.\n\nThus, if the dye emits green light, it will absorb its complementary color, which is red.\n\n<<<B>>>"
