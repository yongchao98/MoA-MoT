    "The fraction of particles, *f*, that reach the detector wall is determined by the exponential decay law, which is dependent on the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀), its Lorentz factor (γ), and the time it takes to travel to the detector wall in the lab frame (t_flight).\n\nThe formula is:\n*f* = e<sup>(-t_flight / (γ * τ₀))</sup>\n\nGiven that the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time of flight to the detector wall of radius *R* = 30 m is:\nt_flight ≈ *R* / *c* = 30 / *c*\n\nSo the survival fraction is:\n*f* = e<sup>(-30 / (c * γ * τ₀))</sup>\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, *f₁* = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n\nPlugging these into the equation gives:\n1/3 = e<sup>(-30 / (c * 20 * τ₀))</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ₀)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ₀)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the wall, *f₂* = 2/3\n*   The required Lorentz factor is γ₂.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n2/3 = e<sup>(-30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)\nln(2) - ln(3) = -30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)\n-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)\n\nNow, we can solve for γ₂ by taking the ratio of the logarithmic equations from both scenarios:\n[ln(3/2)] / [ln(3)] = [30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)] / [1.5 / (c * τ₀)]\nln(3/2) / ln(3) = (30 / γ₂) * (1 / 1.5)\nln(3/2) / ln(3) = 20 / γ₂\n\nRearranging to solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\nUsing the values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.185\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
