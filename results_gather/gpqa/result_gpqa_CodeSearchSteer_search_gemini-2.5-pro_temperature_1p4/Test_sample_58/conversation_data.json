    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which, if any, is in excess after neutralization.\n\n**1. Calculate Moles of Each Component:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = moles of HCl.\n    *   Moles H+ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to release two hydroxide ions for each formula unit: Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles.\n    *   Moles OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\n**2. Neutralization Reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2).\n*   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   We have 0.080 moles of H⁺ and 0.180 moles of OH⁻. The H⁺ is the limiting reactant.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 moles.\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   We have 0.050 moles of CH₃COOH and 0.100 moles of OH⁻ remaining. The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant here.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with CH₃COOH = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 moles.\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻ ions, which makes the solution basic.\n\n**3. Calculate Final pH:**\n\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻). The contribution to the pH from the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in the presence of the much stronger excess OH⁻.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the Solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Concentration of Excess OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
