    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem that involves identifying reactants from spectral data, predicting the outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction, and using 2D NMR spectroscopy to determine the stereochemistry of the products.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Dienophile (Anhydride):**\n    *   The problem describes an anhydride formed from the dehydration of a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent. This is characteristic of the two vinylic protons in maleic anhydride.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) and 137 ppm (alkene carbons), which is also consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Diene:**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n3.  **The Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts. According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* is the minor, thermodynamically favored product.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Product Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **Products:** Both the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products will have the same molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   **¹H NMR Signals:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, we expect:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons on the part of the molecule derived from maleic anhydride.\n        *   Two 1H signals (likely doublets due to geminal coupling) for the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Chemical Shift Assignments (Approximate):**\n        *   Anhydride protons (2H singlet): These protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system. A shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable.\n        *   Vinylic methyls (6H singlet): Methyl groups on a double bond typically appear around 1.7-2.0 ppm.\n        *   Bridgehead methyls (6H singlet): Methyl groups on saturated carbons appear further upfield, ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n        *   Bridge protons (CH₂): These are on a saturated carbon in a bicyclic system, often appearing between 1.0-2.0 ppm. A shift of ~1.5 ppm is plausible for one of them.\n\n5.  **Interpreting the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This is the key to distinguishing the isomers and answering the question. We must find protons that are close in the *endo* (major) isomer but far apart in the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n    *   ***Endo* isomer:** The anhydride part of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the main ring system. This brings the two anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and also close to the *syn* proton of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* isomer:** The anhydride part points \"away\" from the main ring system. This moves the anhydride protons far from the vinylic methyls and the *syn* bridge proton.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present (or much stronger) in the *endo* isomer will be between the anhydride protons and the groups on the same face of the molecule. Both the vinylic methyls and one of the bridge protons are potential candidates.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be a correlation between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. Their relative distance is similar in both isomers.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This describes an interaction between one of the CH₂ bridge protons and the anhydride protons. This is a very strong diagnostic correlation for the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** An interaction between the bridgehead methyls and a CH₂ bridge proton. Their distance is similar in both isomers.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This describes an interaction between the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This correlation would also be present in the *endo* isomer and absent in the *exo*.\n\n7.  **Final Decision (B vs. D):**\n    Both options B and D describe valid NOE correlations that would be present in the *endo* product and absent in the *exo*. However, in many Diels-Alder adducts of this type, the most commonly cited and diagnostically reliable NOE for identifying the *endo* isomer is the one between the anhydride protons and the protons on the bicyclic framework that are held in close proximity, such as the vinylic substituents or the bridge protons. In this specific case, with four methyl groups substituting the diene, the interaction between the anhydride protons and the nearby vinylic methyl groups is a very clear and expected NOE. The chemical shifts provided in option D align perfectly with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This interaction represents a clear spatial proximity between 6 protons and 2 protons, which would result in a significant cross-peak.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the vinylic methyl singlet and the anhydride proton singlet.\n\nFinal check of assignments:\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Vinylic methyl groups.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Anhydride protons.\n\nThese two groups are close in the major (*endo*) product and far apart in the minor (*exo*) product, giving rise to the described NOESY cross-peak.\n\n<<<D>>>"
