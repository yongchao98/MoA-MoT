    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze the properties of each option based on physical principles and known data.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with Earth's density. Earth's average density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is about the same density as Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For an object with the same composition, a smaller mass means there is less gravitational force compressing the material. This planet would therefore be less dense than Earth. This option can be eliminated.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is a \"super-Earth.\" The crucial factor here is gravitational compression. As a planet's mass increases, its gravity compresses its material more tightly, increasing its overall density. Since this planet has the same composition as Earth but is five times more massive, its own gravity will compress it to a volume that is less than five times Earth's volume, resulting in a significantly higher average density. Therefore, its density will be greater than Earth's ~5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) and Planet (b) have a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) has a density lower than 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density higher than 5.5 g/cm³ due to greater gravitational compression.\n\nThus, the planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
