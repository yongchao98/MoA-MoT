    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Components from the Spectra**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum**: An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present. This functional group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n        *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This implies a C₆H₄ group as the core structure.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. The presence of two signals suggests a certain symmetry or substitution pattern, such as in para-substituted compounds where protons opposite each other are equivalent. Regardless of the pattern, this part of the molecule is C₆H₄.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The vinyl proton adjacent to the other vinyl proton and a methyl group appears as a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton, which is only adjacent to the first vinyl proton, appears as a doublet. This group adds C₃H₅ to the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH₃ groups**: One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-C**H₃**). The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality, indicating a methyl ester (-COOCH₃). This adds a methyl group (CH₃) to the ester's carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **No signals for -CH₂ groups**: This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates possibilities containing ethyl or longer alkyl chain groups.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n    Based on the analysis, the unknown compound is composed of:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: C₆H₄\n    *   A propenyl group: -C₃H₅\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH₃ (The atoms to be added are C, O₂, and CH₃)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula**\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from each component:\n    *   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from carbonyl of the ester) + 1 (from the methyl of the ester) = 11 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from benzene ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from the methyl of the ester) = 12 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from the ester group).\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation**\n    The degree of unsaturation for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    This matches the deduced structure:\n    *   1 for the ring structure.\n    *   3 for the double bonds within the aromatic ring.\n    *   1 for the vinyl C=C double bond.\n    *   1 for the carbonyl C=O double bond.\n    *   Total = 6.\n\n    The calculated formula is consistent with the structural features derived from the spectroscopic data.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (Incorrect degree of unsaturation for the identified functional groups)\n    *   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Would contain -CH₂- groups, which are absent)\n\nThe deduced formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
