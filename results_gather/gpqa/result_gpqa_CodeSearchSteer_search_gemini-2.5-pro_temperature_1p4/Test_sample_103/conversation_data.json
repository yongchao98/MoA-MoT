    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to analyze the relationship between the observed radial velocity shifts and the orbital periods of the exoplanets.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity (RV) Method**: This method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The gravitational pull of the planet causes the star to \"wobble,\" leading to a periodic shift in its spectral lines. The amplitude of the star's velocity wobble along our line of sight is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as K.\n\n2.  **Doppler Shift and Velocity**: The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity, Mass, and Period**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (P), the star's mass (M_star), the planet's mass (m_p), and the orbital inclination (i) by the following formula:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star)^(2/3)\n\n    Here, `m_p * sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity directly measured by the RV method when the inclination `i` is unknown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2).\n*   The detected planets have masses similar to Neptune's. In the context of the RV method, this implies that the minimum masses are similar (m_p1 * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p2 * sin(i₂)).\n\nGiven these equalities, the formula for K simplifies. For a constant stellar mass and minimum planet mass, the relationship between K and P is:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nWe can establish a ratio for the two systems:\nK₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂/P₁)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂/P₁), we can rearrange this equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nNow, we substitute the known values for the velocity semi-amplitudes, which are proportional to the wavelength shifts:\n*   K₁ corresponds to Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n*   K₂ corresponds to Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.364\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
