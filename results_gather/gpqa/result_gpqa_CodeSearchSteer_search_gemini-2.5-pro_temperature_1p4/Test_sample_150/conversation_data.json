    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the probability.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to find the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` on a system in the state `|ψ⟩` will yield the value 0. According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is found using the Born rule.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n\n*   The state of the system is the column vector: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`\n*   The observable is the matrix:\n    `P =`\n    `[ 0    1/√2   0    ]`\n    `[ 1/√2   0    1/√2 ]`\n    `[ 0    1/√2   0    ]`\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of P:**\n\nFirst, we must find the eigenvalues of the operator P to confirm that 0 is a possible measurement outcome. This is done by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n\n`det([ -λ    1/√2    0    ])`\n    `([ 1/√2   -λ    1/√2  ]) = 0`\n    `([ 0     1/√2   -λ    ])`\n\n`=> -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((-λ)(1/√2) - 0) = 0`\n`=> -λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0`\n`=> -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n`=> -λ³ + λ = 0`\n`=> λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible outcome of the measurement.\n\n**4. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n\nNext, we find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that corresponds to the eigenvalue `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n\n`[ 0    1/√2   0    ] [x]`   `[0]`\n`[ 1/√2   0    1/√2 ] [y]` = `[0]`\n`[ 0    1/√2   0    ] [z]`   `[0]`\n\nFrom the first and third rows, we get `(1/√2)y = 0`, which means `y = 0`.\nFrom the second row, we get `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which simplifies to `x + z = 0` or `x = -z`.\n\nSo, the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose a simple representation for this eigenvector, such as `[1, 0, -1]`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability:**\n\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the formula: `Prob(λ) = |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v|v⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`.\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n*   `⟨v₀|ψ⟩` (the inner product of the eigenvector and the state vector):\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ = (1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1) = -1 - 1 = -2`\n*   `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`:\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`\n*   `⟨v₀|v₀⟩` (the inner product of the eigenvector with itself):\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [1, 0, -1]ᵀ = (1 * 1) + (0 * 0) + (-1 * -1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` (the inner product of the state vector with itself, which is the squared norm):\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1] * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ = (-1 * -1) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the probability formula:\n`Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
