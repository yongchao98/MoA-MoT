    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the information from both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness of the peak is a result of hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also a key feature of a carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth of these signals strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so the FTIR data confirms this class of compound but does not differentiate between the specific structures.\n\n### **Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data, particularly the complex splitting patterns, is crucial for determining the exact structure of the carbon skeleton. The simple \"n+1 rule\" is used for protons with equivalent neighbors, but when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of protons, more complex patterns like \"doublet of triplets\" emerge.\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the most complex signals in each proposed structure:\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** The proton at C3 would be a doublet of triplets, and the proton at C2 would be a doublet of quartets. This does not match the observed doublet of triplets of triplets and doublet of triplets of quartets.\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** The proton at C3 would be a doublet of quartets of triplets. This does not match the described signals.\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** The protons in this structure would lead to very complex multiplets, but it is unlikely to produce the specific combination of a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets. The proton at C3 could be a doublet of triplet of triplets, but there is no proton that would result in a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** Let's examine the structure `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂(c)CH₃(d))-CH(e)(CH₂(f)CH₃(g))-CH₂(h)-COOH`.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   The single proton H(e), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(c) group, which split each line of the doublet into a **triplet**.\n        *   The three protons of the CH₃(a) group, which split each line of the doublet of triplets into a **quartet**.\n        *   This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, which perfectly matches one of the described signals.\n    *   **Proton H(e):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   The single proton H(b), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(f) group, which split each line of the doublet into a **triplet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(h) group, which split each line of the doublet of triplets into another **triplet**.\n        *   This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching the other complex signal described.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR splitting patterns are unique to the arrangement of protons in the molecule. Only structure **D** can account for both the observed **doublet of triplets of quartets** and the **doublet of triplets of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
