Identify the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**2. Determine the Possible Intermediate States**\nThe decay proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can label $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We must apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay from the intermediate state, we must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only possible integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    This confirms that the transition routes listed in all options are physically possible. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, as the second transition is guaranteed to happen with probability 1 (it's the only available E1 decay channel to a lower energy level).\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic (rotationally invariant) and the decay interaction is also isotropic (when averaged over all photon directions), there can be no preference for decaying into one magnetic sublevel ($m'$) over another.\n*   **Conclusion on Probability:** The transitions to the three degenerate intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be equally probable.\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first step, and they are the only possible outcomes, the probability for each specific route is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of its steps: $P = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe core of the problem is the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nThe decay proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Transition 1:** The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($l=0, m=0$).\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since $n$ must decrease, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Transition 2:** The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($l_f=0, n_f=1$).\n    *   The transition from $l'=1$ to $l_f=0$ gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Since $n$ must decrease, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are valid based on these selection rules.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability of a specific decay route. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay interaction is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single path is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and has the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Physics Problem**\n\nThe core of the task is to analyze the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to identify a valid intermediate state and calculate the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n**2. Apply E1 Selection Rules**\n\nThe rules for an electric dipole transition are fundamental to solving this problem:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.\n*   **Δn < 0**: For a decay process (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions:\n\n*   **Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has `l=0`. The `Δl = ±1` rule means the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n    *   The initial state has `m=0`. The `Δm = 0, ±1` rule means the intermediate state can have `m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n    *   The initial state has `n=3`. The `Δn < 0` rule means `n' < 3`.\n\n*   **Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has `l_f=0`. For this to be a valid transition from `l'=1`, the change is `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`, which is allowed.\n    *   The final state has `n_f=1`. The `Δn < 0` rule means `n' > 1`.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on `n'`, we have `1 < n' < 3`. The only possible integer is `n'=2`. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe key to finding the correct answer is calculating the probability of one specific path.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay process is isotropic (the same in all directions).\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** Because the initial state and the interaction are isotropic, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability of transitioning to any *single* specific intermediate state is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as it's the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific routes is `P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3`.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with a probability of 1/3.

Understand the Physical Process and Selection Rules**\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The E1 selection rules are:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\nThe decay must proceed through an intermediate state, which we can label $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the Conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    This confirms that the transition routes listed in the options are all physically possible.\n\n**3.

Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe question describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it must pass through an intermediate state.\n\nThe governing principles are the E1 selection rules:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The magnetic quantum number must change by zero or one: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For the decay to proceed, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number $n'$, we have $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability of a specific route. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the most critical point. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n\nSince there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single, specific route is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe total probability for any of the specific routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe must select the option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ -> **Correct route and correct probability.**\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n\nAll candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling the options, correctly deduce that the probability for any specific valid route is 1/3. Option B from the prompt is the only one that reflects this correct physical reasoning.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe core of the problem is the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This process can be represented as:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe E1 selection rules, which govern these transitions, are:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.\n*   **Δn < 0**: For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nAll candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules to identify the possible intermediate states $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule Δl = ±1 requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The rule Δn < 0 requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition from $l'=1$ to be allowed, the change must be Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The rule Δn < 0 requires $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability of a specific route. All candidate answers converge on the same correct reasoning.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Equal Probability:** Due to this isotropy, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of its steps: $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe task is to select the option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.

This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** Because the initial state is isotropic (rotationally invariant) and the decay interaction is also isotropic (when averaged over all photon directions), there can be no preference for decaying into one magnetic sublevel ($m'$) over another.\n*   **Conclusion:** The transitions to the three degenerate intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be equally probable.\n*   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first step, and they are the only possible outcomes, the probability for each specific route is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4.

The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The key to solving this problem is to apply the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nThe decay proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can label $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We can determine its properties by applying the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), we find that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed, transition routes through the intermediate states:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor between the options is the probability. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** This is the most critical part of the analysis. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay process must be isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate p-orbital. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) for any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's examine the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: Assuming the typo means the initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, the route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on a rigorous application of quantum mechanical principles, which is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers, the correct probability for any of the valid decay paths is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Option A is the only one that reflects this correct physical result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physical Process\n\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state.\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This necessitates an intermediate state, which we can label $|k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe full process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the following selection rules must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay to identify the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The rule $\\Delta n < 0$ requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ to be allowed, the change must be $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid. This confirms $l'=1$.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining Constraints:** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n'$, must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, leading to three valid decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes presented in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This is a crucial point. Because the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, and the decay interaction (averaged over all photon directions) is also isotropic, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only possible channel, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5.

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, the following step-by-step reasoning determines the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step process involving electric dipole (E1) transitions. This process requires an intermediate state. The entire decay is governed by the E1 selection rules.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: E1 Selection Rules.** These rules are non-negotiable for this type of transition.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, must be negative for decay (emission of a photon).\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nLet the intermediate state be denoted by $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We must apply the selection rules to both transitions: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$ and $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ dictates that the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The rule $\\Delta n < 0$ requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For a transition from $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed. This confirms the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The rule $\\Delta n < 0$ requires $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Combining Constraints.** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($n'<3$ and $n'>1$), we find the only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n\nThis analysis proves that there are exactly three possible intermediate states, and thus three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes shown in the options are physically possible.

Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of one specific route.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Symmetry of the Initial State.** This is the most critical aspect of the calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** In the absence of external fields, the decay interaction is also isotropic (uniform in all directions). Therefore, the atom has no preference for which of the three degenerate $m'$ sublevels of the intermediate state it decays into.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** The total probability must be distributed equally among the three possible channels. Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first step, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single, specific path is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. As this is the only available channel, its probability is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of a complete cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step: $P_{total} = P_{step 1} \\times P_{step 2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4.

The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n**2. Determine the Possible Intermediate States**\nThe decay proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can label $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We must apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay from the intermediate state, we must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$ and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only possible integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    This confirms that the transition routes listed in all options are physically possible. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This probability is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, as the second transition is guaranteed to happen with probability 1 (it's the only available E1 decay channel to a lower energy level).\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Isotropic Decay:** Because the initial state is isotropic (rotationally invariant) and the decay interaction is also isotropic (when averaged over all photon directions), there can be no preference for decaying into one magnetic sublevel ($m'$) over another.\n*   **Conclusion on Probability:** The transitions to the three degenerate intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, must be equally probable.\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first step, and they are the only possible outcomes, the probability for each specific route is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of its steps: $P = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe core of the problem is the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nThe decay proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can denote as $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Transition 1:** The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($l=0, m=0$).\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since $n$ must decrease, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Transition 2:** The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($l_f=0, n_f=1$).\n    *   The transition from $l'=1$ to $l_f=0$ gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Since $n$ must decrease, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are valid based on these selection rules.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability of a specific decay route. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay interaction is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single path is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and has the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Physics Problem**\n\nThe core of the task is to analyze the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a two-step process, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition. We need to identify a valid intermediate state and calculate the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n**2. Apply E1 Selection Rules**\n\nThe rules for an electric dipole transition are fundamental to solving this problem:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.\n*   **Δn < 0**: For a decay process (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions:\n\n*   **Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has `l=0`. The `Δl = ±1` rule means the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n    *   The initial state has `m=0`. The `Δm = 0, ±1` rule means the intermediate state can have `m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n    *   The initial state has `n=3`. The `Δn < 0` rule means `n' < 3`.\n\n*   **Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has `l_f=0`. For this to be a valid transition from `l'=1`, the change is `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1`, which is allowed.\n    *   The final state has `n_f=1`. The `Δn < 0` rule means `n' > 1`.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on `n'`, we have `1 < n' < 3`. The only possible integer is `n'=2`. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe key to finding the correct answer is calculating the probability of one specific path.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay process is isotropic (the same in all directions).\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** Because the initial state and the interaction are isotropic, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   **Calculation:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability of transitioning to any *single* specific intermediate state is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as it's the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability for any of the three specific routes is `P = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3`.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with a probability of 1/3.

The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it must pass through an intermediate state.\n\nThe governing principles are the E1 selection rules:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The magnetic quantum number must change by zero or one: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For the decay to proceed, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number $n'$, we have $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability of a specific route. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Probability of the first step:** This is the most critical point. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay must be isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n\nSince there are three equally probable outcomes for the first transition, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single, specific route is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe total probability for any of the specific routes is $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe must select the option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and $\\frac{2}{3}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ -> **Correct route and correct probability.**\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ -> Incorrect probability.\n\nAll candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling the options, correctly deduce that the probability for any specific valid route is 1/3. Option B from the prompt is the only one that reflects this correct physical reasoning.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Process and Selection Rules\n\nThe core of the problem is the decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This process can be represented as:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 Step 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe E1 selection rules, which govern these transitions, are:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by one.\n*   **Δn < 0**: For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nAll candidate answers correctly apply the selection rules to identify the possible intermediate states $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule Δl = ±1 requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The rule Δn < 0 requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition from $l'=1$ to be allowed, the change must be Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. The rule Δn < 0 requires $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability of a specific route. All candidate answers converge on the same correct reasoning.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n*   **Equal Probability:** Due to this isotropy, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   **Branching Ratio:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single path is exactly **1/3**.\n*   **Second Step Probability:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay channel to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of its steps: $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe task is to select the option that presents a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **This option presents a valid route and the correct probability.**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that any specific decay path has a probability of 1/3.

The key to solving this problem is to apply the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number:** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 2. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nThe decay proceeds through an intermediate state, which we can label $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We can determine its properties by applying the selection rules to both steps of the decay.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. For decay, the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition to be allowed from an intermediate state with $l'=1$, the change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), we find that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed, transition routes through the intermediate states:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe deciding factor between the options is the probability. The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** This is the most critical part of the analysis. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, the decay process must be isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate p-orbital. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (branching ratio) for any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay path to a lower energy level is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's examine the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correctly calculated probability.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: Assuming the typo means the initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, the route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on a rigorous application of quantum mechanical principles, which is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers, the correct probability for any of the valid decay paths is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Option A is the only one that reflects this correct physical result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physical Process\n\nThe question describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state.\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This necessitates an intermediate state, which we can label $|k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe full process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Application of Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the following selection rules must be met:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease: $\\Delta n < 0$.\n\n### 3. Determination of the Intermediate State\n\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the decay to identify the properties of the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$. The rule $\\Delta n < 0$ requires $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For the transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ to be allowed, the change must be $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is valid. This confirms $l'=1$.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$. For this to be a decay, the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Combining Constraints:** The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, $n'$, must satisfy both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer that fits is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible intermediate states, leading to three valid decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes presented in the options are physically possible. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This is a crucial point. Because the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, and the decay interaction (averaged over all photon directions) is also isotropic, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$). Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single one of them is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only possible channel, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any of the three specific routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluation of the Options\n\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route and has the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The initial state is missing, and the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Physical Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies the existence of an intermediate state.\n\nThe E1 selection rules that govern these transitions are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (photon emission), the principal quantum number must decrease.\n\n**2.

The only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible, physically allowed transition routes through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe crucial part of the question is to determine the probability of a *specific* route. This probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric.

The decay happens via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Principles: E1 Selection Rules**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that electric dipole transitions are governed by a specific set of selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay is a two-step process, so it must pass through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ forces the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The initial state has $n=3$, so the intermediate state must have $n'<3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0$. For this transition to be allowed from the intermediate state, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$ (since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$), which is consistent with the first step.\n    *   The final state has $n_f=1$, so the intermediate state must have $n'>1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically allowed intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThis is the most critical step and where the options differ.\n*   **The Symmetry Argument:** A crucial point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is the nature of the initial state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$. This is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric.\n*   **Equal Probability:** Because the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, and the decay interaction (averaged over all photon directions) is isotropic, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$).\n*   **Probability of the First Step:** Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability (or branching ratio) of decaying into any *single one* of these states is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Probability of the Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only allowed E1 decay to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n*   **Total Probability:** The probability of any complete, specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of its steps: $P_{total} = P_{step1} \\times P_{step2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that any valid decay route through one of the 2p states has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.
