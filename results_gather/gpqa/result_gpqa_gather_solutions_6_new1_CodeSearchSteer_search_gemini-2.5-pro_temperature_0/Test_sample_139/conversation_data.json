Deconstruct the Chemical Puzzle and Identify the Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The first clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The problem states that a molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also common. This points to a common reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates a powerful reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups, forming a diol. This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n*   **Verification of the Entire Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: X = LiAlD₄. The reaction is with a liquid Y. To produce D₂ gas, Y must be a deuterium source, so Y = D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). When G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B). All clues are consistent.\n\n**2.

We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D), with a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (²⁷Al), with a mass number of **27**.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n**3.

I will leverage the consensus reasoning from the candidate answers, which is highly consistent and logical. After identifying the chemical formula for \"Substance X\", I will proceed to the calculation step as required by the question.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\" (which is ~3.85 °C). This is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D).\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the context of deuterium, deuterium gas (D₂) is the logical choice. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The clues point to X being a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry with a common analog. Its reaction with a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms confirms it's a strong reducing agent. The most common such reagent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), and its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This substance fits all the clues, including its violent reaction with heavy water to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃).\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n    *   The heaviest element by atomic number is Aluminum.\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D=2, Al=27.\n    *   The sum is: (4 atoms of D × mass 2) + (1 atom of Al × mass 27).\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the elements and their isotopes in Substance X (LiAlD4).\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (D).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum, present as 1 atom of its stable isotope (Al).\n\n# Step 2: Define the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\nmass_of_deuterium = 2\nmass_of_aluminum = 27\n\n# Step 3: Define the number of atoms for each element involved in the calculation.\nnum_deuterium_atoms = 4\nnum_aluminum_atoms = 1\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element.\ntotal_mass_from_lightest_element = num_deuterium_atoms * mass_of_deuterium\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element.\ntotal_mass_from_heaviest_element = num_aluminum_atoms * mass_of_aluminum\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the final cumulative mass by summing the two totals.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_from_lightest_element + total_mass_from_heaviest_element\n\n# Step 7: Print the final calculated value.\nprint(\"The calculated cumulative atomic mass is:\", cumulative_mass)\n\n# Step 8: Match the result to the given options.\n# Options: A) 29, B) 25, C) 31, D) 35\n# The calculated value 35 corresponds to option D.\nprint(\"The correct option is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated cumulative atomic mass is: 35\nThe correct option is D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Chemical Puzzle to Identify the Substances**\n\n*   **Step 1.1: Identify Substance B.** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n*   **Step 1.2: Identify Gas W.** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Given that the reaction involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂). A single Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Step 1.3: Identify Substance X.** Several clues point to the identity of X:\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also a common reagent.\n    *   It reduces a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms in its ketone and carboxylic acid groups) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a powerful reduction that converts both functional groups into alcohols, forming a diol. This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   The most common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues.\n\n*   **Step 1.4: Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence.** Let's test the hypothesis that X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with a liquid Y.

It produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). When the precipitate G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B): `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   All clues are consistent. **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**2. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 2.1: Identify the elements for calculation.** The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\" (LiAlD₄). The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D). Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n\n*   **Step 2.2: Sum the masses.** The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of **2**. There are four D atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (²⁷Al), which has a mass number of **27**. There is one Al atom.\n\n*   **Step 2.3: Calculate the final value.**\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n**3.

The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen, Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a near-perfect match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned throughout the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identify Gas W.** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that the reaction involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single Deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly fits the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identify Substance X.** Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a powerful reduction reaction where both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups are reduced to alcohols, forming a diol (which has 2 oxygen atoms). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   The most common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence.** Let's confirm that X = LiAlD₄ works for the entire process.\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    *   When the precipitate G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B): `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   All clues are consistent. **Substance X is unambiguously LiAlD₄**.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements.** Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Careful Point 6: Sum the Correct Isotope Masses.** The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (²⁷Al), which has a mass number of **27**.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of Deuterium. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.**\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer Selection\n\nThe step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle and the subsequent calculation consistently yield a value of 35.

This is a very strong clue that **Substance B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen with a mass number of 2).\n\n*   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Given that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.

This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly indicates that **B is D₂O** and the \"heavier isotope\" involved is Deuterium (D).\n\n*   **Identification of Gas W:** The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the context of deuterium, the logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).

Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose and release B (D₂O). All clues are consistent.\n\n### 2. Performing the Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Instruction:** Sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements.

The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen, deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a near-perfect match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that a molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   **Reagent Type:** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n    *   **Reactivity:** It reacts with a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. To reduce the oxygen count from 3 to 2, both functional groups must be reduced to alcohols, forming a diol. This requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n4.  **Verification of the Entire Reaction Sequence:** Let's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with a liquid Y. To produce D₂ gas, Y must be a deuterium source. The most logical choice for liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G). When the precipitate G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B). All clues are consistent.\n\n### Part 2: Performing the Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\", which we have identified as LiAlD₄.\n\n1.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:**\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n\n2.  **Sum the Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (Al), which has a mass number of **27**.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D). The total mass is 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **one** atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Part 3: Final Answer\n\nThe step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle and the subsequent calculation both consistently lead to the value of 35. The provided options are A) 35, B) 29, C) 31, and D) 25. The calculated value of 35 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, a consistent and logical solution emerges. The problem can be broken down into two main parts: solving the chemical puzzle and performing the subsequent calculation.\n\n### **Part 1: Solving the Chemical Puzzle**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly deduce the identities of the unknown substances through a step-by-step analysis of the clues.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Heavy Isotope.** The cornerstone of the puzzle is the melting point of substance B, given as \"very close to 277 K\". This is approximately 3.85 °C, which is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C. This key insight correctly identifies substance B as D₂O and the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the Gaseous Product.** Gas W is described as a molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given the presence of deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the logical conclusion is that W is deuterium gas (D₂), as the molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying Substance X.** The clues for substance X are that it contains deuterium, it is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, and it has a very common analog. Its reaction with a keto acid (3 oxygen atoms) to form a product with 2 oxygen atoms indicates it reduces both a ketone and a carboxylic acid to alcohols. This points directly to Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated analog of the common and powerful reducing agent Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). The described violent reaction with liquid Y (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) which releases B (D₂O) upon heating, confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n### **Part 2: Performing the Calculation**\n\nThe second part of the task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Identifying the Correct Elements.** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1). Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Summing All Relevant Atoms.** The instruction requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. In the LiAlD₄ molecule, this includes four atoms of the lightest element (as Deuterium) and one atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\n\n*   **Careful Point 6: Using Correct Isotope Masses.** The calculation must use the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved. The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D), with a mass number of 2. The stable isotope of aluminum (Al) has a mass number of 27.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n(Mass of 4 Deuterium atoms) + (Mass of 1 Aluminum atom)\n= (4 × 2) + (1 × 27)\n= 8 + 27\n= 35\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis of the chemical puzzle and the subsequent calculation consistently and unambiguously yield a result of 35. The options provided in the question are A) 35, B) 31, C) 25, and D) 29. The calculated value of 35 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The solution requires identifying several unknown substances based on the clues provided.\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Analysis:** Converting Kelvin to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O) but is a near-perfect match for the 3.82 °C melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is heavy water (D₂O). This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n    *   **Clue:** A molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   **Analysis:** Since the reaction involves deuterium, the most logical candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂). A single deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the clue.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is deuterium gas (D₂).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n    *   **Clue 1:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B (D₂O). This reaction sequence is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride reacting with heavy water (Y) to form a metal deuteroxide (G), which then decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 2:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This suggests a common reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n    *   **Clue 3:** The reaction of a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates that X is a powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups.\n    *   **Synthesis:** The most common and powerful reducing agent fitting these descriptions is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits every clue for Substance X. The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)` is violent and produces the correct products.\n\n### **2. Performing the Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Summing the Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** The final value is the sum of these masses.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = **35**\n\n### **3. Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis and the subsequent calculation consistently and unambiguously lead to the value of 35. The provided options are A) 31, B) 29, C) 25, and D) 35.\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Chemical Puzzle**\n\nThe problem is a chemical riddle that requires identifying several unknown substances (X, Y, W, G, B) based on a series of clues.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Heavy Isotope:**\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Analysis:** Converting Kelvin to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O) but is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is heavy water (D₂O). This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" in the problem as Deuterium (D).\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:**\n    *   **Clue:** A molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   **Analysis:** Since the reaction involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas (D₂). A single Deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is Deuterium gas (D₂).\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common reagent and its isotopically-labeled version.\n    *   **Clue 2:** The reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. Reducing both to alcohols would result in a diol, which has 2 oxygen atoms. This requires a very powerful reducing agent, as carboxylic acids are difficult to reduce.\n    *   **Analysis:** Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a common, powerful reducing agent capable of this transformation. Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits the description of a reagent with a common analog and one that contains the heavy isotope, Deuterium.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n4.  **Verification of the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with liquid Y to produce W (D₂) and a precipitate G, which releases B (D₂O) on heating.\n    *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). When heated, Al(OD)₃ decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). All clues are consistent.\n\n### **Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:**\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n\n2.  **Sum the Masses of the Specific Isotopes:**\n    *   The problem requires using the masses of the specific isotopes present.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** It is present as four atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 atoms × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** It is present as one atom of its stable isotope, ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 atom × 27 = 27.\n\n3.  **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated value is 35.

Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The clue refers to the entire molecule, not a single atom. D₂ fits this description perfectly.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of X.\n    *   It is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also common. This suggests a common reagent and its isotopically labeled (deuterated) version.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This indicates a powerful reduction reaction where both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups are reduced to alcohols, forming a diol.\n    *   The most common and powerful reducing agent for this purpose is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The reaction sequence must be fully consistent. The reaction of LiAlD₄ (X) with heavy water D₂O (Y) is `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate of Aluminum Deuteroxide (G). Heating this precipitate (G) would cause it to decompose and release heavy water (B). All clues are satisfied.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n### 2. Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), summing the masses of all atoms of those elements.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Sum of Masses:** We must use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (Al), which has a mass number of **27**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The calculation must include *all* atoms of the specified elements. There are four atoms of Deuterium and one atom of Aluminum.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 = 8\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nThe chemical analysis consistently identifies Substance X as LiAlD₄. The calculation based on this substance yields a cumulative atomic mass of 35. Comparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 29\nD) 25\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Chemical Puzzle\n\nThe problem is a multi-step chemical riddle. The most logical approach is to identify each unknown substance based on the clues provided.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance B:** The first key clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is an excellent match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is deuterium.\n\n*   **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that a molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that deuterium is involved in the reaction, the most logical candidate for gas W is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X:\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n    *   **Strong Reducing Agent:** The reaction of a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms in its ketone and carboxylic acid groups) with X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a reduction of both functional groups to alcohols, forming a diol. This type of reaction requires a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Identity:** The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues: it contains the heavy isotope deuterium, its analog (LiAlH₄) is extremely common, and it is a strong reducing agent.\n\n*   **Verification of the Entire Reaction Sequence:** Let's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with a liquid Y. If X is LiAlD₄, Y must be a deuterium source to produce the observed products. The most logical choice for liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and a gelatinous precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). When the precipitate G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B). This is consistent with all the clues.\n    *   Therefore, all evidence unambiguously points to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n### 2. Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number Z=13).\n*   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved, as implied by the integer answer choices.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (²⁷Al), with a mass number of **27**.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of Deuterium (D₄). The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:**\n    *   (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis of the chemical properties correctly identifies Substance X as LiAlD₄. The calculation based on the atomic masses of the lightest (4 atoms of Deuterium) and heaviest (1 atom of Aluminum) elements yields a cumulative mass of 35.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 25\nB) 35\nC) 31\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Part 1: Solving the Chemical Puzzle\n\nThe problem is a chemical riddle that requires identifying several unknown substances (X, Y, W, G, B) based on a series of clues.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The first critical clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen, deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a near-perfect match, strongly indicating that **Substance B is D₂O**. This also reveals that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that a molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Given that deuterium is involved, the most logical candidate is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A single deuterium atom (²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description. Thus, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X:** Several clues point to the identity of Substance X.\n    *   **Reagent Type:** X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog is used as a reagent\". This points to a common reagent and its isotopically labeled version.\n    *   **Reactivity:** It reacts with a keto acid (which contains 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. To reduce the oxygen count from 3 to 2, both functional groups must be reduced to alcohols, forming a diol. This requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most common powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n4.  **Verification of the Entire Reaction Sequence:** Let's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The reaction is described as X reacting violently with a liquid Y. To produce D₂ gas, Y must be a deuterium source. The most logical choice for liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate (G). When the precipitate G is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B). All clues are consistent.\n\n### Part 2: Performing the Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\", which we have identified as LiAlD₄.\n\n1.  **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:**\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n\n2.  **Sum the Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of the lightest element is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of **2**.\n    *   The stable isotope of the heaviest element is Aluminum (Al), which has a mass number of **27**.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D). The total mass is 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **one** atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\n### Part 3: Final Answer\n\nThe step-by-step analysis of the chemical puzzle and the subsequent calculation both consistently lead to the value of 35.
