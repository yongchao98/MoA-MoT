The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.

The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species (where n=2) is calculated using the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]) and the overall stability constants (βₙ). The correct formula, identified by all candidate agents, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **List Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The problem provides the total thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M and the total cobalt concentration as 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M). Since the ligand is in a tenfold excess compared to the metal ion, it is a standard and valid chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, with its total initial concentration. Therefore, we use `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n    *   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) shows that the concentration of the free cobalt ion, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. Consequently, the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed for the calculation of the *percentage distribution* of the species.\n    *   **Denominator Terms:** The denominator represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt-containing species. It is crucial to include the term '1', which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ = 1), in addition to the terms for each of the four complexes.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Using the given values:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n    *   **Numerator:** The term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n        Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator:** This is the sum of the terms for all possible species.\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Convert to Percentage:**\n        Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Decide:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **16.9%**. The provided options in the question are:\n    A) 38.1%\n    B) 25.6%\n    C) 16.9%\n    D) 42.3%\n\n    The calculated result matches option C. The candidate answers all correctly performed the calculation, but due to variations in the option lettering they were presented with, their final letter choices differed. Based on the options in the prompt, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 2. Identify the Correct Formula\nThe percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (αₙ) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. All candidate answers correctly identified the governing formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\nThe calculation, as correctly performed by all candidate agents, proceeds as follows using the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n**Numerator Calculation:**\nThe term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\nNumerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n**Denominator Calculation:**\nThe denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible species.\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (free ion): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n**Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**Percentage Calculation:**\nPercentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 4. List of Careful Points\n*   **Ligand Concentration Assumption:** The calculation relies on the valid assumption that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, is approximately equal to its total initial concentration (0.1 M). This is justified because the total thiocyanate concentration is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction is consumed to form complexes.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The term for the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Denominator Composition:** It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term (where β₀ = 1) represents the free Co²⁺ ion and ensures that all cobalt-containing species are accounted for.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The calculation robustly yields 16.9%. The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the calculation itself, but in matching this numerical result to the correct lettered option, as the option lists seem to vary between candidates. The decision must be based on the options provided in the original question prompt.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a value of **16.9%**. According to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 38.1%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first verify the calculation method used by the agents, which appears to be consistent across all answers. I will then perform the calculation myself using Python to ensure accuracy. The core of the problem is to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex and convert it to a percentage. Finally, I will compare this calculated percentage to the specific options provided in the original question to determine the correct choice.\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The task is to find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex relative to all other cobalt-containing species.\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** The percentage is derived from the mole fraction (α₂) of the complex. The formula for α₂ uses the stability constants (β) and the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n3.  **Address Key Assumptions:** A crucial and valid assumption is that the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M) because it is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M).\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** I will substitute the given values into the formula and compute the result using a Python script.\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:** I will compare the calculated percentage to the options given in the prompt (A: 38.1%, B: 42.3%, C: 25.6%, D: 16.9%) and select the matching option.\n\n```python\n# Define the given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, alpha_2, is given by the formula:\n# alpha_2 = (beta2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n# The total cobalt concentration is not needed as it cancels out in the fraction calculation.\n# We assume [SCN-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration (0.1 M) as it is in large excess.\n\n# Calculate the numerator term for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species.\n# The term for the free Co2+ ion (n=0) is 1.\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\n# Print the result and the options from the original question to make a clear choice\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nGiven options from the question:\")\nprint(\"A) 38.1%\")\nprint(\"B) 42.3%\")\nprint(\"C) 25.6%\")\nprint(\"D) 16.9%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: 16.9%\n\nGiven options from the question:\nA) 38.1%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including a list of careful points and the final calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Chemical Principle:** This is a complexometric equilibrium problem. The distribution of the metal ion among various complex forms (`[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, etc.) and its free form (`Co²⁺`) is determined by the concentration of the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) and the overall stability constants (β) of the complexes.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Governing Equation:** The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    This formula correctly represents the concentration of the target species relative to the sum of the concentrations of all possible cobalt-containing species.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration Approximation:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). Since the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. All candidate answers correctly identified and used this approximation.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The `[Co²⁺]` term, which is a function of `c(Co)`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator when deriving the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** The denominator of the mole fraction formula must include the term '1'. This term represents the relative concentration of the free (uncomplexed) `Co²⁺` ion (as β₀ is defined as 1). Omitting this term is a common mistake, but all candidate answers correctly included it.\n*   **Correct Numerator:** The numerator must correspond to the species of interest. For `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the correct term is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n2.  **Calculate the numerator:**\n    Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n3.  **Calculate each term in the denominator:**\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: **1**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1) = **0.9**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n4.  **Sum the denominator terms:**\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n5.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n6.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation consistently and robustly yields a value of approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers correctly performed this calculation. The discrepancy in their final letter choices appears to be due to inconsistent lists of options presented to them. Based on the options provided in the question prompt:\n\nA) 25.6%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 2. Identify the Correct Formula\nThe percentage of a specific complex is determined by its mole fraction (αₙ) multiplied by 100. For the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the mole fraction α₂ is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. All candidate answers correctly identified the governing formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n### 3. List Careful Points and Assumptions\nA thorough analysis requires considering the following points, which were correctly handled by the candidate agents:\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives the total thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M and the total cobalt concentration as 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M). Since the ligand is in a tenfold excess, the amount consumed to form complexes is small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, with its total initial concentration, 0.1 M.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) shows that the concentration of the free metal ion, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. As a result, the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species.\n*   **Denominator Terms**: The denominator represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt-containing species. It is crucial to include the term '1' (representing β₀=1), which accounts for the free `Co²⁺` ions. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nThe calculation is consistent across all candidate answers. Let's verify it step-by-step using the provided data:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of approximately 16.9%. The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers was not in the calculation but in matching the result to the correct lettered option, as they appeared to be working with different lists of options. Based on the options provided in the original question prompt:\n\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nctrl95>H\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step evaluation to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Formula:** The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the ratio of its concentration term to the sum of all concentration terms. This can be expressed using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. All candidate answers correctly identified the governing formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Verify the Calculation:** The next step is to substitute the given values and perform the calculation.

This is a valid assumption because the total thiocyanate concentration is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of it will be consumed to form complexes.\n*   **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** It is crucial to include the '1' in the denominator of the mole fraction formula. This term (where β₀ = 1) represents the free Co²⁺ ions and is essential for correctly calculating the total proportion of all species.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed to calculate the *percentage* distribution of the species. The free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, which is a function of c(Co), cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers was not the calculation itself, but the final step of matching the numerical result (16.9%) to the correct lettered option.

Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 2. Identify the Correct Formula\nThe percentage of a specific complex is determined by its mole fraction (αₙ) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species (where n=2) is calculated using the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the overall stability constants (βₙ). The correct formula, which is unanimously agreed upon by all candidate answers, is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n### 3. List Careful Points and Assumptions\nA thorough analysis requires considering the following key points:\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem gives the *total* thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. Since the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is ten times smaller, the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to the total concentration, 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The term for the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Denominator Terms:** The denominator represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt-containing species. It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator, which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1).\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Numerator (for [Co(SCN)₂]):**\n    `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator (sum for all species):**\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): `1`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of Denominator =** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**. The candidate answers all agree on this numerical result, although they differ on which letter option it corresponds to due to variations in the option lists they were given.\n\nBased on the options provided in the main question prompt:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Candidate Solutions\n\n1.  **Universal Agreement on Method**: All candidate answers correctly identify the problem as a complexometric equilibrium calculation. They all use the correct formula to determine the mole fraction (α₂) of the desired species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n2.  **Universal Agreement on Calculation**: All candidate answers that show their work perform the calculation correctly, arriving at the same numerical result. The calculation is as follows:\n    *   **Numerator**: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   **Denominator**: 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂)**: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Percentage**: 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n3.  **Discrepancy Analysis**: The only discrepancy among the candidate answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is because the agents were presented with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The core calculation, however, is unanimously correct.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The calculation requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A key, and valid, assumption made by all agents is that since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the free ligand concentration can be approximated as the total concentration, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Inclusion of Free Metal Ion**: The denominator of the mole fraction formula must account for all species, including the free (uncomplexed) Co²⁺ ion. This is represented by the '1' term (since β₀ = 1), which all agents correctly included.\n*   **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage* distribution of the species, as it cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**. To determine the final answer, this result must be matched with the options provided in the original question:\n\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Problem and Methodology\n\nThe core task is to calculate the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) `[Co(SCN)₂]`, out of all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the standard method for this calculation, which involves finding the mole fraction (α) of the desired species. The formula for the mole fraction of the nth complex, αₙ, is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\n\nFor the target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage is then simply α₂ × 100%. This methodology is unanimously agreed upon and is correct.\n\n### 2. Careful Points and Assumptions\n\nSeveral key points and assumptions must be handled correctly, and the candidate answers have done so consistently:\n\n*   **Identifying the Target Complex:** The question asks for the \"dithiocyanato\" complex, which means the one with two thiocyanate ligands (`[Co(SCN)₂]`). This corresponds to n=2 and requires the use of the stability constant β₂ in the numerator.\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total thiocyanate concentration is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M), it is a valid and standard chemical approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **The '1' in the Denominator:** The denominator must include a '1' term, which represents the free (uncomplexed) Co²⁺ ion (where β₀ is defined as 1). This is crucial for accounting for all cobalt species.\n*   **Irrelevance of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n\n### 3. Verification of the Calculation\n\nThe calculation, as performed by all candidate agents, is as follows:\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:**\n    *   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:**\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    *   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    *   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**.

Analysis of the Problem and Methodology\n\nThe core task is to calculate the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, out of all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the standard chemical principle and formula for this calculation. The percentage is determined by the mole fraction (α) of the species, which depends on the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe formula for the mole fraction of the target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (denoted α₂), is:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage is then simply α₂ × 100%.\n\n### 2. Careful Points and Assumptions\n\nA rigorous solution requires considering the following points, which were handled correctly by the majority of the candidate agents:\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem gives the *total* concentration as 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total metal concentration (c(Co) = 10⁻² M), it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Thus, `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Inclusion of Free Ion**: The denominator of the formula must include the term '1' (representing β₀ = 1) to account for the fraction of free, uncomplexed Co²⁺ ions.\n\n### 3.

Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nThe candidate answers show a strong consensus on the numerical result of 16.9%.

Analysis of Methodology\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the fundamental approach to solving this problem. The method involves calculating the mole fraction (α₂) of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, using the following formula, which is derived from complexometric equilibrium principles:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe final percentage is then obtained by multiplying the mole fraction (α₂) by 100.\n\n### 3. Careful Points and Assumptions\nA thorough review of the candidate answers and the problem statement highlights several critical points that were handled correctly by all agents:\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is in a tenfold excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (10⁻² M), it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not required to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The term for the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Formula Integrity:** It is crucial to include the term \"1\" in the denominator, which represents the free Co²⁺ ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1). All candidates correctly included this term.\n*   **Correct Terms:** The numerator must correspond to the species of interest. For `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the correct term is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`, which was used by all candidates.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Calculation Verification\nThe calculation is performed by substituting the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n**Numerator Calculation:**\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n**Denominator Calculation:**\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\nSum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n**Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**Percentage Calculation:**\nPercentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 5.

The approach involves calculating the mole fraction (α₂) of the desired species using the following formula, which is derived from the definitions of the overall stability constants (β):\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe final percentage is then obtained by multiplying α₂ by 100.\n\n### 2. Careful Points and Assumptions\n\nA rigorous analysis requires considering several key points, all of which were correctly handled by the candidate answers in their calculations:\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total thiocyanate concentration is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. Its value is important for justifying the assumption about the free ligand concentration, but it cancels out of the final percentage formula.\n*   **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** The denominator of the formula must include the term '1', which represents the relative concentration of the free (uncomplexed) Co²⁺ ion. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n\n### 3. Verification of the Calculation\n\nThe calculation was performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers.

The correct formula, which was unanimously identified by all candidate answers, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Substitute Given Values and Perform Calculation:**\n    *   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n    *   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n    *   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n    *   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the numerator, which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species:\n    *   **Numerator** = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    Next, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt-containing species:\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n    Sum the terms to find the value of the denominator:\n    *   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    Now, calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n    *   **α₂** = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ **0.16916**\n\n    Finally, convert the mole fraction to a percentage:\n    *   **Percentage** = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the ligand is in large excess compared to the metal ion (0.1 M vs. 10⁻² M), it is a valid and standard chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration with the total concentration. All candidate answers correctly applied this assumption.\n*   **Role of Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The term for the free metal ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **The \"1\" in the Denominator:** The denominator of the fraction represents the sum of the relative amounts of all species.

Since the ligand is in a tenfold excess compared to the metal ion, it is a standard and valid chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, with its total initial concentration. Therefore, we use `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n    *   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) shows that the concentration of the free cobalt ion, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. Consequently, the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed for the calculation of the *percentage distribution* of the species.\n    *   **Denominator Terms:** The denominator represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt-containing species.

Identify the Correct Formula\nThe percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (αₙ) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. All candidate answers correctly identified the governing formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\nThe calculation, as correctly performed by all candidate agents, proceeds as follows using the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n**Numerator Calculation:**\nThe term for the desired complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\nNumerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n**Denominator Calculation:**\nThe denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible species.\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (free ion): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n**Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**Percentage Calculation:**\nPercentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 4. List of Careful Points\n*   **Ligand Concentration Assumption:** The calculation relies on the valid assumption that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, is approximately equal to its total initial concentration (0.1 M). This is justified because the total thiocyanate concentration is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction is consumed to form complexes.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The term for the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Denominator Composition:** It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term (where β₀ = 1) represents the free Co²⁺ ion and ensures that all cobalt-containing species are accounted for.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The calculation robustly yields 16.9%. The primary discrepancy among the candidate answers is not in the calculation itself, but in matching this numerical result to the correct lettered option, as the option lists seem to vary between candidates. The decision must be based on the options provided in the original question prompt.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a value of **16.9%**.

I will then perform the calculation myself using Python to ensure accuracy. The core of the problem is to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex and convert it to a percentage. Finally, I will compare this calculated percentage to the specific options provided in the original question to determine the correct choice.\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The task is to find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex relative to all other cobalt-containing species.\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** The percentage is derived from the mole fraction (α₂) of the complex. The formula for α₂ uses the stability constants (β) and the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n3.  **Address Key Assumptions:** A crucial and valid assumption is that the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M) because it is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M).\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** I will substitute the given values into the formula and compute the result using a Python script.\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:** I will compare the calculated percentage to the options given in the prompt (A: 38.1%, B: 42.3%, C: 25.6%, D: 16.9%) and select the matching option.\n\n```python\n# Define the given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, alpha_2, is given by the formula:\n# alpha_2 = (beta2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n# The total cobalt concentration is not needed as it cancels out in the fraction calculation.\n# We assume [SCN-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration (0.1 M) as it is in large excess.\n\n# Calculate the numerator term for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species.\n# The term for the free Co2+ ion (n=0) is 1.\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\n# Print the result and the options from the original question to make a clear choice\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nGiven options from the question:\")\nprint(\"A) 38.1%\")\nprint(\"B) 42.3%\")\nprint(\"C) 25.6%\")\nprint(\"D) 16.9%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: 16.9%\n\nGiven options from the question:\nA) 38.1%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including a list of careful points and the final calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Chemical Principle:** This is a complexometric equilibrium problem. The distribution of the metal ion among various complex forms (`[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, etc.) and its free form (`Co²⁺`) is determined by the concentration of the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) and the overall stability constants (β) of the complexes.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Governing Equation:** The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    This formula correctly represents the concentration of the target species relative to the sum of the concentrations of all possible cobalt-containing species.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration Approximation:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). Since the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration, the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. All candidate answers correctly identified and used this approximation.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The `[Co²⁺]` term, which is a function of `c(Co)`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator when deriving the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** The denominator of the mole fraction formula must include the term '1'. This term represents the relative concentration of the free (uncomplexed) `Co²⁺` ion (as β₀ is defined as 1). Omitting this term is a common mistake, but all candidate answers correctly included it.\n*   **Correct Numerator:** The numerator must correspond to the species of interest. For `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the correct term is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1.  **Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   `β₁` = 9\n    *   `β₂` = 40\n    *   `β₃` = 63\n    *   `β₄` = 16\n\n2.  **Calculate the numerator:**\n    Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n3.  **Calculate each term in the denominator:**\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺`: **1**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1) = **0.9**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n4.  **Sum the denominator terms:**\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n5.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n6.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation consistently and robustly yields a value of approximately 16.9%. All candidate answers correctly performed this calculation. The discrepancy in their final letter choices appears to be due to inconsistent lists of options presented to them. Based on the options provided in the question prompt:\n\nA) 25.6%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 2. Identify the Correct Formula\nThe percentage of a specific complex is determined by its mole fraction (αₙ) multiplied by 100. For the complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the mole fraction α₂ is calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. All candidate answers correctly identified the governing formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n### 3. List Careful Points and Assumptions\nA thorough analysis requires considering the following points, which were correctly handled by the candidate agents:\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The problem gives the total thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M and the total cobalt concentration as 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M). Since the ligand is in a tenfold excess, the amount consumed to form complexes is small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, with its total initial concentration, 0.1 M.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) shows that the concentration of the free metal ion, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. As a result, the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species.\n*   **Denominator Terms**: The denominator represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt-containing species. It is crucial to include the term '1' (representing β₀=1), which accounts for the free `Co²⁺` ions. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n\n### 4. Perform the Calculation\nThe calculation is consistent across all candidate answers. Let's verify it step-by-step using the provided data:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of approximately 16.9%.

The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the ratio of its concentration term to the sum of all concentration terms. This can be expressed using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. All candidate answers correctly identified the governing formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Verify the Calculation:** The next step is to substitute the given values and perform the calculation.

This is a valid assumption because the total thiocyanate concentration is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of it will be consumed to form complexes.\n*   **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** It is crucial to include the '1' in the denominator of the mole fraction formula. This term (where β₀ = 1) represents the free Co²⁺ ions and is essential for correctly calculating the total proportion of all species.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed to calculate the *percentage* distribution of the species. The free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, which is a function of c(Co), cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The primary source of error among the candidate answers was not the calculation itself, but the final step of matching the numerical result (16.9%) to the correct lettered option.

List Careful Points and Assumptions\nA thorough analysis requires considering the following key points:\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem gives the *total* thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. Since the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is ten times smaller, the ligand is in large excess.

They all use the correct formula to determine the mole fraction (α₂) of the desired species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n2.  **Universal Agreement on Calculation**: All candidate answers that show their work perform the calculation correctly, arriving at the same numerical result. The calculation is as follows:\n    *   **Numerator**: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   **Denominator**: 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂)**: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Percentage**: 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n3.  **Discrepancy Analysis**: The only discrepancy among the candidate answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is because the agents were presented with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The core calculation, however, is unanimously correct.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The calculation requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. A key, and valid, assumption made by all agents is that since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the free ligand concentration can be approximated as the total concentration, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Inclusion of Free Metal Ion**: The denominator of the mole fraction formula must account for all species, including the free (uncomplexed) Co²⁺ ion. This is represented by the '1' term (since β₀ = 1), which all agents correctly included.\n*   **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage* distribution of the species, as it cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**. To determine the final answer, this result must be matched with the options provided in the original question:\n\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1.

The formula for the mole fraction of the nth complex, αₙ, is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\n\nFor the target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage is then simply α₂ × 100%. This methodology is unanimously agreed upon and is correct.\n\n### 2. Careful Points and Assumptions\n\nSeveral key points and assumptions must be handled correctly, and the candidate answers have done so consistently:\n\n*   **Identifying the Target Complex:** The question asks for the \"dithiocyanato\" complex, which means the one with two thiocyanate ligands (`[Co(SCN)₂]`). This corresponds to n=2 and requires the use of the stability constant β₂ in the numerator.\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total thiocyanate concentration is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M), it is a valid and standard chemical approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **The '1' in the Denominator:** The denominator must include a '1' term, which represents the free (uncomplexed) Co²⁺ ion (where β₀ is defined as 1). This is crucial for accounting for all cobalt species.\n*   **Irrelevance of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n\n### 3. Verification of the Calculation\n\nThe calculation, as performed by all candidate agents, is as follows:\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n*   **Numerator Calculation:**\n    *   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Denominator Calculation:**\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n    *   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage Calculation:**\n    *   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 4.

The problem gives the *total* concentration as 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in a tenfold excess compared to the total metal concentration (c(Co) = 10⁻² M), it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Thus, `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Inclusion of Free Ion**: The denominator of the formula must include the term '1' (representing β₀ = 1) to account for the fraction of free, uncomplexed Co²⁺ ions.\n\n### 3.

The method involves calculating the mole fraction (α₂) of the target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, using the following formula, which is derived from complexometric equilibrium principles:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe final percentage is then obtained by multiplying the mole fraction (α₂) by 100.\n\n### 3. Careful Points and Assumptions\nA thorough review of the candidate answers and the problem statement highlights several critical points that were handled correctly by all agents:\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is in a tenfold excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (10⁻² M), it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not required to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The term for the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Formula Integrity:** It is crucial to include the term \"1\" in the denominator, which represents the free Co²⁺ ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1).

Step-by-Step Calculation Verification\nThe calculation is performed by substituting the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n**Numerator Calculation:**\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n**Denominator Calculation:**\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\nSum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n**Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**Percentage Calculation:**\nPercentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of **16.9%**. The candidate answers all correctly performed this calculation. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent representations of the multiple-choice options within their individual responses.\n\nReferring to the options provided in the main question prompt:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Problem and Methodology\n\nThe core task is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the standard method for solving this type of complexometric equilibrium problem. The approach involves calculating the mole fraction (α₂) of the desired species using the following formula, which is derived from the definitions of the overall stability constants (β):\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe final percentage is then obtained by multiplying α₂ by 100.\n\n### 2. Careful Points and Assumptions\n\nA rigorous analysis requires considering several key points, all of which were correctly handled by the candidate answers in their calculations:\n\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total thiocyanate concentration is in a tenfold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. Its value is important for justifying the assumption about the free ligand concentration, but it cancels out of the final percentage formula.\n*   **Inclusion of the Free Ion:** The denominator of the formula must include the term '1', which represents the relative concentration of the free (uncomplexed) Co²⁺ ion. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n\n### 3. Verification of the Calculation\n\nThe calculation was performed correctly and consistently across all candidate answers. Let's verify it step-by-step using the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n1.  **Calculate the numerator (the term for [Co(SCN)₂]):**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n2.  **Calculate the denominator (the sum of terms for all species):**\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n3.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n4.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and unanimously yields a value of **16.9%**. The final step is to match this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 25.6%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds directly to option B. While many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly, they showed inconsistencies in mapping their numerical result to the correct letter option. Based on a rigorous verification of the chemistry, the formula, and the arithmetic, the answer is unequivocally 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct elements from the candidate answers and identifying crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Governing Equation:** The percentage of a specific complex is determined by its mole fraction (αₙ) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species (where n=2) is calculated using the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]) and the overall stability constants (βₙ). The correct formula, which was unanimously identified by all candidate answers, is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Substitute Given Values and Perform Calculation:**\n    *   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n    *   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n    *   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n    *   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the numerator, which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species:\n    *   **Numerator** = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    Next, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of the terms for all possible cobalt-containing species:\n    *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = **0.9**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n    Sum the terms to find the value of the denominator:\n    *   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    Now, calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\n    *   **α₂** = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ **0.16916**\n\n    Finally, convert the mole fraction to a percentage:\n    *   **Percentage** = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the ligand is in large excess compared to the metal ion (0.1 M vs. 10⁻² M), it is a valid and standard chemical assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration with the total concentration. All candidate answers correctly applied this assumption.\n*   **Role of Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species. The term for the free metal ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **The \"1\" in the Denominator:** The denominator of the fraction represents the sum of the relative amounts of all species. The \"1\" term (corresponding to β₀=1) represents the free `Co²⁺` ion and is essential for a correct calculation. All candidate answers correctly included this term.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The calculation performed by all candidate agents was correct, consistently yielding a result of ~16.9%. The primary source of error among the candidates was incorrectly matching this numerical result to the lettered options, which appeared in different orders in their prompts. Based on the options provided in the original question, the calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option A.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step calculation robustly yields a value of approximately 16.9%. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
