The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\n\nA) 25\nB) 31\nC) 35\nD) 29\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script successfully executed the plan to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The script started by identifying two plausible candidates for Substance X, a deuterated reducing agent: Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n*   **Constraint Application & Pruning:** The script then applied the constraints from the problem description:\n    1.  The reaction with liquid Y (identified as D₂O) must form a precipitate (G). The script correctly determined that LiAlD₄ forms a precipitate of aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), while NaBD₄ forms soluble products. This eliminated NaBD₄ as a candidate.\n    2.  Heating the precipitate G releases substance B with a melting point near 277 K. The script confirmed that heating Al(OD)₃ releases D₂O, whose melting point is ~277 K. This validated the choice of LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Final Choice & Calculation:** With LiAlD₄ as the sole surviving candidate, the script proceeded to the final calculation.\n    *   Substance X: LiAlD₄\n    *   Constituent elements by mass: Al (27), Li (7), D (2).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al).\n    *   Lightest element: Deuterium (D).\n    *   The cumulative mass was calculated by summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements: (1 × mass of Al) + (4 × mass of D) = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle and arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Clues\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is an extremely close match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance X and its Properties:**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since B is D₂O, the heavy isotope is deuterium (D).\n    *   Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its deuterated analog, Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits this description perfectly.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms. This supports the identification of X as a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Reaction:**\n    *   The clues describe the reaction: **X + Y → W (gas) + G (precipitate)**.\n    *   We have hypothesized that **X is LiAlD₄**. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water and other protic compounds.\n    *   The gas **W** has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine potential gas molecules:\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   Helium-4 (He): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Fits, but unlikely product.\n        *   Nitrogen-14 (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Fits, but unlikely product.\n    *   For D₂ gas to be produced, LiAlD₄ must react with a deuterium source. Let's assume liquid **Y is D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   The reaction would be: **LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂**\n    *   This reaction produces **gas W = D₂**, which matches the clue.\n    *   It also produces a precipitate. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a precipitate. Its deuterated analog, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**. This fits.\n\n4.  **Confirming the Final Clue:**\n    *   The final clue states that heating the precipitate G releases B.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose. The thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O).\n    *   Therefore, heating aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would produce alumina (Al₂O₃) and heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: **2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O**\n    *   This means the released substance is D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This confirms our deductions.\n\n### Summary of Identified Substances:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O)\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂)\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O)\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), considering that the masses of all instances of these elements must be summed.\n\n1.  **Identify elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, the lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the formula unit:**\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium (²H or D) isotope. The mass number of deuterium is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element = 1 × 27 = 27\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe detailed analysis of the chemical clues strongly points to Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). The search results confirm the chemical properties required to solve the puzzle:\n\n*   **Substance X (LiAlD₄):** This is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, analogous to Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). It is known to react violently with water.\n*   **Liquid Y (D₂O - Heavy Water):** LiAlH₄ reacts violently with normal water (H₂O). By analogy, LiAlD₄ would react violently with heavy water (D₂O).\n*   **Gas W (D₂ - Dideuterium):** The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The resulting gas, D₂, consists of two deuterium atoms, each with one proton and one neutron, meaning the molecule has a total of two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description.\n*   **Precipitate G (Al(OD)₃ - Aluminum Deuteroxide):** The reaction produces aluminum deuteroxide, which is analogous to aluminum hydroxide, a known precipitate.\n*   **Substance B (D₂O - Heavy Water):** Heating aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) causes it to decompose and release water. Therefore, heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would release B (D₂O).\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is very close to the stated 277 K.\n*   **Reaction with a Keto Acid:** LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into alcohols (a diol). The resulting diol product contains two oxygen atoms, matching the clue.\n\nWith Substance X identified as LiAlD₄, the final calculation can be performed.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), summing the masses of all atoms of those elements.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (of which Deuterium, D, is an isotope).\n2.  **Determine atomic masses (using integer approximations):**\n    *   Deuterium (D): ~2 amu\n    *   Lithium (Li): ~7 amu\n    *   Aluminum (Al): ~27 amu\n3.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative mass for each of these elements in the molecule:**\n    *   **Lightest (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of its isotope, Deuterium (D).\n        Cumulative Mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Heaviest (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum (Al).\n        Cumulative Mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n5.  **Sum the cumulative masses:**\n    *   Total Cumulative Mass = 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of regular water (H₂O) is 273.15 K. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K, a near-perfect match for 277 K. Therefore, **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The identification of B as D₂O and W as D₂ strongly suggests this isotope is deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) is violent and produces deuterium gas: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   In this reaction, Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would be the precipitate (G).\n    *   When precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, is heated, it decomposes to release heavy water (B, D₂O), according to the reaction: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is analogous to the thermal decomposition of aluminium hydroxide.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid with LiAlD₄ (a strong reducing agent) would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms. This confirms the chemical nature of X.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within the molecule. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of Aluminium (Al). The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses = 8 (from D) + 27 (from Al) = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between G and B**\nPrecipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This means that G is a deuterated hydrate, a compound that incorporates D₂O into its structure, which is released upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, would decompose upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. Its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some common gases:\n*   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). **(p = n)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O.\n*   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   HF: 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\nGiven the context of deuterium, D₂ is the most likely candidate for W.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Substance X and the reaction**\n*   Substance X contains a heavier isotope. We've established this is likely deuterium (D).\n*   X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits the description perfectly. Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n*   X reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. It is logical to assume the reaction here is between LiAlD₄ (X) and D₂O (Y, a liquid that fits the context).\n*   Let's write the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n*   Let's check if this reaction matches the clues:\n    *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of metal hydrides/deuterides with water/heavy water is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As determined in Step 3, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with the final clue**\n*   The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group. It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n*   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (excess) → (workup) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH.\n*   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue confirms our identification of X.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer**\nWe have identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within this substance.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Hydrogen (H, Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum (Al, Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n    *   Lithium (Li, Z=3) is in between.\n*   **Sum the masses of these elements as they appear in the molecule:** The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" instructs us to count all atoms of the specified elements in the formula. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of Al is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Calculate the cumulative mass:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from lightest element's atoms) + (Mass from heaviest element's atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided chemical clues, the unknown substances have been identified:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy Water (D₂O)\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂)\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy Water (D₂O)\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X, which is LiAlD₄.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Determine the lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Find the relevant isotopes and their masses:**\n    *   The problem specifies that Substance X contains a heavier isotope. In LiAlD₄, hydrogen is present as its heavier stable isotope, Deuterium (²H or D). There are four atoms of Deuterium. The atomic mass of a single Deuterium atom is approximately 2.014 Da.\n    *   Aluminum's only stable isotope is Aluminum-27 (²⁷Al). There is one atom of Aluminum in the molecule. The atomic mass of an Aluminum-27 atom is approximately 26.982 Da.\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative masses:** The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium):** 4 × 2.014 Da = 8.056 Da\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** 1 × 26.982 Da = 26.982 Da\n    *   **Total cumulative mass:** 8.056 Da + 26.982 Da = 35.038 Da\n\nThe calculated value of 35.038 is closest to the integer 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify Substance B from its physical properties.\n    2.  Deduce the nature of the reaction and other substances (G, W, Y) based on the identity of B and the reaction description.\n    3.  Use all the clues, including its use in organic chemistry, to identify Substance X.\n    4.  Once X is identified, calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest constituent elements.\n\n*   **Execution 1: Identify Substance B**\n    The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This melting point is characteristic of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C.\n    Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Execution 2: Deduce G, W, Y and X**\n    *   Precipitate G releases B (D₂O) when heated. This is typical for a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. So, **G is a deuterated hydroxide**.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider simple molecules. Deuterium gas (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms (¹H₂). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description. So, **W is likely D₂**.\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → G (deuterated hydroxide) + W (D₂ gas).\n    *   For the products to be a deuterated hydroxide and deuterium gas, the reactants must supply the metal, the deuterium, and the oxygen. The most plausible reaction is a deuterated compound reacting with heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Let's test the clue that X's analog is a common organic reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of \"incorporating a heavier isotope (D) of one of its constituent elements (H)\". Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces a precipitate G (a mix of LiOD and Al(OD)₃), and releases gas W (D₂). This matches all the clues perfectly.\n\n*   **Execution 3: Verify with the final clue**\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (containing both a ketone C=O and a carboxylic acid -COOH) with substance X (LiAlD₄, a strong reducing agent) is considered.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reduces both functional groups: the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would be reduced to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH).\n    *   This final product, the diol, contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms our identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Execution 4: Calculate the final answer**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We will use integer masses for the calculation as is standard for this type of problem (D≈2, Al≈27).\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are 4 Deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is 1 Aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly indicates that substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W released in the reaction has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly. A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (Substance B). This implies that X is a deuterated compound that reacts with a deuterated liquid (Y, likely D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. The precipitate G must be a deuteroxide compound that decomposes upon heating to yield an oxide and D₂O.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Substance X:**\n    *   **Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄):** While it is a deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry, its reaction with D₂O (NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂) would produce soluble products (sodium deuteroxide and boric acid/deuteroxide), not a precipitate. Therefore, NaBD₄ is not Substance X.\n    *   **Calcium Deuteride (CaD₂):** Its analog, calcium hydride (CaH₂), is used in organic chemistry as a drying agent. CaD₂ reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and calcium deuteroxide (Ca(OD)₂). Calcium hydroxide is sparingly soluble in water and would form a precipitate (G). Heating Ca(OD)₂ would yield CaO and D₂O (B). This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄):** Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, fitting the clue perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water (or D₂O). The reaction with D₂O is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g).\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble in water (G).\n        *   Heating aluminum deuteroxide (G) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a classic reagent for reducing keto acids.\n    *   Comparing CaD₂ and LiAlD₄, the latter (and its analog LiAlH₄) is far more prominent as a reactive reagent for transformations like reducing keto acids, making it the stronger candidate.\n\n5.  **Confirm Substance X:** Based on the evidence, Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum.\n    *   The formula contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element's isotope (D).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula.\n    *   Using the mass numbers of the most common isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (Al) atom ≈ 27.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (D) atom ≈ 2.\n        *   Total mass = (1 × Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n        *   Total mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which fits this description perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:** Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating, which suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The release of a gas (W) whose molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons points strongly to Deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and its Reaction:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (deuterium) and reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas. A well-known reagent in organic chemistry that fits this description is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Its non-deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very common and powerful reducing agent that reacts violently with water. The reaction that produces D₂ gas would be LiAlD₄ reacting with heavy water (D₂O), which would be liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces deuterium gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G), which upon heating would yield heavy water (B).\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Keto Acid Clue:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry. It reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups.

Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent used to reduce carboxylic acids and ketones. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ contains deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen. This fits the description, making **Substance X = LiAlD₄**. Its common analog is LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid to alcohols.

A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description. This confirms **Gas W = D₂** and **Liquid Y = D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue:** A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\n    *   **Inference:** In the reaction products (LiOD and Al(OD)₃), aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. Heating aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) will release B (D₂O).\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Inference:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K.

In Celsius, this is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O).\n\n2.  **Identifying Gas W**: The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider some simple gaseous molecules:\n    *   Hydrogen (H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   Deuterium (D₂): 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). This is a perfect match.\n    *   Nitrogen (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    *   Carbon Monoxide (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    Given that heavy water is involved, D₂ is the most logical identity for gas W.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reaction**: A violent reaction involving a deuterated substance (as implied by the presence of D₂O and D₂) that produces D₂ gas suggests the reaction of a strong deuterated reducing agent with heavy water. A very common class of reagents in organic chemistry are metal hydrides. The problem states an analog of substance X is a common reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n4.  **Confirming Substance X and the Reaction**: Let's assume Substance X is LiAlD₄ and liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction produces deuterium gas (W = D₂), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Lithium deuteroxide is soluble.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases heavy water (B = D₂O), which also matches our initial finding.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is known to be violent, so the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be as well.\n\n5.  **Verifying with the Keto Acid Clue**: The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both of these groups to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄, summing the masses of all atoms for each of those two elements.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Li (3), Al (13), and H (1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H).

The identification of B as D₂O and W as D₂ strongly suggests this isotope is deuterium (D), the heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits the description of Substance X.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and a precipitate G. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) is violent and produces deuterium gas: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   In this reaction, Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would be the precipitate (G).\n    *   When precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, is heated, it decomposes to release heavy water (B, D₂O), according to the reaction: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is analogous to the thermal decomposition of aluminium hydroxide.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid with LiAlD₄ (a strong reducing agent) would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms. This confirms the chemical nature of X.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within the molecule. We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of Aluminium (Al). The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses = 8 (from D) + 27 (from Al) = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between G and B**\nPrecipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This means that G is a deuterated hydrate, a compound that incorporates D₂O into its structure, which is released upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, would decompose upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. Its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some common gases:\n*   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). **(p = n)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O.\n*   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   HF: 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\nGiven the context of deuterium, D₂ is the most likely candidate for W.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Substance X and the reaction**\n*   Substance X contains a heavier isotope. We've established this is likely deuterium (D).\n*   X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits the description perfectly. Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n*   X reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. It is logical to assume the reaction here is between LiAlD₄ (X) and D₂O (Y, a liquid that fits the context).\n*   Let's write the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n*   Let's check if this reaction matches the clues:\n    *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of metal hydrides/deuterides with water/heavy water is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As determined in Step 3, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with the final clue**\n*   The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group. It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n*   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (excess) → (workup) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH.\n*   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue confirms our identification of X.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer**\nWe have identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within this substance.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Hydrogen (H, Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum (Al, Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n    *   Lithium (Li, Z=3) is in between.\n*   **Sum the masses of these elements as they appear in the molecule:** The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" instructs us to count all atoms of the specified elements in the formula. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of Al is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Calculate the cumulative mass:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from lightest element's atoms) + (Mass from heaviest element's atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided chemical clues, the unknown substances have been identified:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy Water (D₂O)\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂)\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy Water (D₂O)\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X, which is LiAlD₄.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Determine the lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Find the relevant isotopes and their masses:**\n    *   The problem specifies that Substance X contains a heavier isotope. In LiAlD₄, hydrogen is present as its heavier stable isotope, Deuterium (²H or D). There are four atoms of Deuterium. The atomic mass of a single Deuterium atom is approximately 2.014 Da.\n    *   Aluminum's only stable isotope is Aluminum-27 (²⁷Al). There is one atom of Aluminum in the molecule. The atomic mass of an Aluminum-27 atom is approximately 26.982 Da.\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative masses:** The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium):** 4 × 2.014 Da = 8.056 Da\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** 1 × 26.982 Da = 26.982 Da\n    *   **Total cumulative mass:** 8.056 Da + 26.982 Da = 35.038 Da\n\nThe calculated value of 35.038 is closest to the integer 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify Substance B from its physical properties.\n    2.  Deduce the nature of the reaction and other substances (G, W, Y) based on the identity of B and the reaction description.\n    3.  Use all the clues, including its use in organic chemistry, to identify Substance X.\n    4.  Once X is identified, calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest constituent elements.\n\n*   **Execution 1: Identify Substance B**\n    The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This melting point is characteristic of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C.\n    Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Execution 2: Deduce G, W, Y and X**\n    *   Precipitate G releases B (D₂O) when heated. This is typical for a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. So, **G is a deuterated hydroxide**.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider simple molecules. Deuterium gas (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms (¹H₂). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description. So, **W is likely D₂**.\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → G (deuterated hydroxide) + W (D₂ gas).\n    *   For the products to be a deuterated hydroxide and deuterium gas, the reactants must supply the metal, the deuterium, and the oxygen. The most plausible reaction is a deuterated compound reacting with heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Let's test the clue that X's analog is a common organic reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of \"incorporating a heavier isotope (D) of one of its constituent elements (H)\". Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces a precipitate G (a mix of LiOD and Al(OD)₃), and releases gas W (D₂). This matches all the clues perfectly.\n\n*   **Execution 3: Verify with the final clue**\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (containing both a ketone C=O and a carboxylic acid -COOH) with substance X (LiAlD₄, a strong reducing agent) is considered.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reduces both functional groups: the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would be reduced to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH).\n    *   This final product, the diol, contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms our identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Execution 4: Calculate the final answer**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We will use integer masses for the calculation as is standard for this type of problem (D≈2, Al≈27).\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are 4 Deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is 1 Aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly indicates that substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W released in the reaction has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly. A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (Substance B). This implies that X is a deuterated compound that reacts with a deuterated liquid (Y, likely D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. The precipitate G must be a deuteroxide compound that decomposes upon heating to yield an oxide and D₂O.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Substance X:**\n    *   **Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄):** While it is a deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry, its reaction with D₂O (NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂) would produce soluble products (sodium deuteroxide and boric acid/deuteroxide), not a precipitate. Therefore, NaBD₄ is not Substance X.\n    *   **Calcium Deuteride (CaD₂):** Its analog, calcium hydride (CaH₂), is used in organic chemistry as a drying agent. CaD₂ reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and calcium deuteroxide (Ca(OD)₂). Calcium hydroxide is sparingly soluble in water and would form a precipitate (G). Heating Ca(OD)₂ would yield CaO and D₂O (B). This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄):** Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, fitting the clue perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water (or D₂O). The reaction with D₂O is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g).\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble in water (G).\n        *   Heating aluminum deuteroxide (G) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a classic reagent for reducing keto acids.\n    *   Comparing CaD₂ and LiAlD₄, the latter (and its analog LiAlH₄) is far more prominent as a reactive reagent for transformations like reducing keto acids, making it the stronger candidate.\n\n5.  **Confirm Substance X:** Based on the evidence, Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum.\n    *   The formula contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element's isotope (D).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula.\n    *   Using the mass numbers of the most common isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (Al) atom ≈ 27.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (D) atom ≈ 2.\n        *   Total mass = (1 × Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n        *   Total mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which fits this description perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:** Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating, which suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The release of a gas (W) whose molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons points strongly to Deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and its Reaction:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (deuterium) and reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas. A well-known reagent in organic chemistry that fits this description is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Its non-deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very common and powerful reducing agent that reacts violently with water. The reaction that produces D₂ gas would be LiAlD₄ reacting with heavy water (D₂O), which would be liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces deuterium gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G), which upon heating would yield heavy water (B).\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Keto Acid Clue:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry. It reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups. The resulting product, a diol, would contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** Now we must find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe evidence confirms the initial deductions. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer based on the clues and the search results.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance X and related compounds:**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, particularly for reactions involving keto acids.\n    *   **Inference:** This points to a reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent used to reduce carboxylic acids and ketones. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ contains deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen. This fits the description, making **Substance X = LiAlD₄**. Its common analog is LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid to alcohols. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the properties of LiAlH₄ and by extension, LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Identification of the reaction components (Y, W, G, B):**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   **Clue:** Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Inference:** The gas produced in the proposed reaction is D₂ (deuterium gas). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description. This confirms **Gas W = D₂** and **Liquid Y = D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue:** A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\n    *   **Inference:** In the reaction products (LiOD and Al(OD)₃), aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. Heating aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) will release B (D₂O).\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Inference:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is indeed very close to 277 K, confirming that **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n    *   **Isotopes present in LiAlD₄:**\n        *   For Hydrogen: Four atoms of the heavier isotope, Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2 (1 proton, 1 neutron).\n        *   For Aluminum: One atom. The only naturally occurring stable isotope is ²⁷Al (13 protons, 14 neutrons).\n        *   For Lithium: One atom. Naturally occurring lithium is a mix of ⁶Li and ⁷Li. We will use the most common isotope, ⁷Li, for identification, but it is not needed for the final calculation.\n    *   **The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present.** This means summing the masses of all aluminum atoms and all deuterium atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). Using the mass number, the total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number is 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value.\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K. In Celsius, this is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O).\n\n2.  **Identifying Gas W**: The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider some simple gaseous molecules:\n    *   Hydrogen (H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   Deuterium (D₂): 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). This is a perfect match.\n    *   Nitrogen (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    *   Carbon Monoxide (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    Given that heavy water is involved, D₂ is the most logical identity for gas W.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reaction**: A violent reaction involving a deuterated substance (as implied by the presence of D₂O and D₂) that produces D₂ gas suggests the reaction of a strong deuterated reducing agent with heavy water. A very common class of reagents in organic chemistry are metal hydrides. The problem states an analog of substance X is a common reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n4.  **Confirming Substance X and the Reaction**: Let's assume Substance X is LiAlD₄ and liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction produces deuterium gas (W = D₂), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Lithium deuteroxide is soluble.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases heavy water (B = D₂O), which also matches our initial finding.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is known to be violent, so the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be as well.\n\n5.  **Verifying with the Keto Acid Clue**: The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both of these groups to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄, summing the masses of all atoms for each of those two elements.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Li (3), Al (13), and H (1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The approximate atomic mass of Deuterium is 2 amu.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, with an approximate atomic mass of 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative sum**: 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
