The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of product E, which is identified as Iodine Trifluoride (IF₃).\n\nTo determine the symmetry, we use VSEPR theory:\n1.  The central atom is Iodine (I), which has 7 valence electrons.\n2.  It forms single bonds with 3 Fluorine (F) atoms, contributing 3 electrons.\n3.  The total number of valence shell electrons is 7 + 3 = 10, which corresponds to 5 electron pairs.\n4.  The electron geometry for 5 pairs is trigonal bipyramidal.\n5.  With 3 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs, the lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions to minimize repulsion.\n6.  This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry for IF₃.\n\nA T-shaped molecule has a C₂ rotational axis and two vertical mirror planes (σv), one of which is the plane of the molecule itself. This combination of symmetry elements corresponds to the **C₂v** point group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires identifying a series of unknown compounds based on their reactions. Let's break down the clues to find the identity of the extremely hazardous product E and its molecular symmetry.\n\n**1. Identifying the Common Reactants (B, D, H, F, G):**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** The reaction of two common gases, B and D, in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) strongly suggests the formation of phosgene. So:\n    *   Gas B is **Chlorine (Cl₂)**.\n    *   Gas D is **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**.\n    *   Solvent H is **Phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product C reacts with water to reform solid A and two acids, F and G.\n    *   Since C is formed from a reaction involving chlorine (B), its hydrolysis will produce a strong acid F, which must be **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**.\n    *   Acid G is described as weak. The hydrolysis of salts or non-metal halides often produces a weak acid alongside a strong one.\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Reaction and Product E:**\n\nThe puzzle's remaining reactions are:\n*   **Reaction 1:** Solid A + 8 Cl₂ (B) → Bright red product C.\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 CO (D) → Extremely hazardous product E.\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A + HCl (F) + G (weak acid).\n\nThe clues, particularly the regeneration of A and the unusual stoichiometry, point to a very specific and somewhat obscure chemical system. While the reaction scheme is difficult to resolve completely without ambiguity, we can deduce the likely identity of E by focusing on Reaction 2 and the nature of hazardous chemical products.\n\nThe reaction `C + 2 CO → E` suggests that E is a carbonyl compound. A plausible, though not definitively proven, candidate for E that fits the description of \"extremely hazardous\" and can be formed from a reaction involving chlorine and carbon monoxide is **Oxalyl Chloride ((COCl)₂)**.\n\n**3. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n\nLet's assume E is Oxalyl Chloride. Its structure is Cl-C(=O)-C(=O)-Cl. This molecule can exist in several conformations. The two most stable are the *trans* and *cis* planar forms. The *cis* conformer, where both C=O bonds and both C-Cl bonds are on the same side of the C-C bond, possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two vertical mirror planes.\n\nThe symmetry elements for cis-Oxalyl Chloride are:\n*   An identity element (E).\n*   A two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that bisects the C-C bond.\n*   Two vertical planes of reflection (σᵥ), one being the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nA molecule with these symmetry elements belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group. This point group is very common for bent or V-shaped molecules like water (H₂O), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and phosgene (COCl₂).\n\nGiven the options, C₂ᵥ is the most chemically plausible symmetry for the hazardous product E.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis chemical riddle can be solved by identifying the substances involved in each reaction.\n\n1.  **Reaction 4: D + B → H (1:1 ratio, H is a solvent)**\n    This strongly suggests a well-known industrial reaction. Two common possibilities for a 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a liquid solvent are:\n    *   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → COCl₂ (liquid, phosgene)\n    *   SO₂ (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → SO₂Cl₂ (liquid, sulfuryl chloride)\n\n2.  **Identifying E and its Symmetry**\n    The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E, which is described as an \"extremely hazardous product.\" Both phosgene (COCl₂) and sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) are hazardous liquids that are used as solvents. It is plausible that the hazardous product E is the same as the solvent H.\n\n    *   **If E is phosgene (COCl₂):** This molecule is planar. It has a C₂ axis of rotation along the C=O bond and two vertical mirror planes. This corresponds to the **C2v** point group.\n    *   **If E is sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂):** This molecule has a distorted tetrahedral shape. It possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two mirror planes, which also places it in the **C2v** point group.\n\n    Since both logical candidates for product E have C2v symmetry, we can confidently determine the answer without needing to resolve the more complex or potentially flawed clues in the other reactions. The remaining clues about the \"bright red product C\" and its hydrolysis appear to be inconsistent with simple, well-known chemical reactions, but they are not necessary to identify the symmetry of E.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants B, D, and Product H:**\n    *   Reaction 4 states that gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. A classic example of this is the reaction of ethylene (C₂H₄) with chlorine (Cl₂) to produce 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), a common solvent.\n    *   Let's assume:\n        *   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)\n        *   D = C₂H₄ (Ethylene gas)\n        *   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n2.  **Identify Solid A and Product C:**\n    *   Reaction 1 states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) to form the bright red product C.\n    *   Let's consider A to be elemental sulfur (S₈), which is a solid. Sulfur reacts with excess chlorine in a two-step process. The overall reaction can be written as S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂.\n    *   The product, sulfur dichloride (SCl₂), is described as a cherry-red liquid. This fits the description of a \"bright red product C\".\n    *   So, we can identify:\n        *   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n        *   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n\n3.  **Verify the Hydrolysis Reaction:**\n    *   Reaction 3 states that C reacts with water to reform A, plus a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n    *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a disproportionation reaction. A balanced equation for the reaction is 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S.\n    *   This reaction reforms elemental sulfur (A = S₈).\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid (F).\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (G).\n    *   This perfectly matches the description.\n\n4.  **Identify the Hazardous Product E:**\n    *   Reaction 2 states that C (SCl₂) reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (C₂H₄) to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n    *   The product, bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n    *   Therefore, E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas).\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E, mustard gas.\n    *   The molecule has the structure Cl-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₂-CH₂-Cl. The C-S-C group is bent, similar to water, due to the lone pairs on the sulfur atom.\n    *   Due to rotational freedom around the single bonds, the molecule adopts a preferred low-energy conformation. This conformation is not planar.\n    *   The molecule lacks an inversion center and any mirror planes (σ).\n    *   However, it possesses a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. The two chloroethyl arms are positioned as rotational images of each other.\n    *   A molecule that has only a C₂ axis of symmetry belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nWe are given a series of reactions and properties for several unknown substances (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H).\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n2.  **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n3.  **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(acid, strong) + G(acid, weak)\n4.  **Reaction 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n5.  **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? The options are A) D∞h, B) C2, C) D4h, D) C2v.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Most Constraining Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 3 (Hydrolysis of C):** This is the most chemically specific clue. The reaction of C with water regenerates the solid starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The fact that A is reformed suggests that A is an element (likely a metal or metalloid) that is part of a complex or unstable compound C, and is released in its elemental form upon hydrolysis.\n    *   The formation of two different acids implies that the part of C that is not A (which comes from gas B) must contain at least two different non-metal elements that form acids upon hydrolysis.\n\n*   **A Plausible Chemical System for Clue 3:** A well-known reaction that fits this description is the hydrolysis of iodine trichloride (ICl₃).\n    *   5 ICl₃ + 9 H₂O → I₂(s) + 15 HCl(aq) + 3 HIO₃(aq)\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   **A = I₂** (Iodine is a solid at standard conditions). A is reformed.\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid).\n        *   **G = HIO₃** (Iodic acid is a weaker acid than HCl).\n    *   This system perfectly matches the description in Clue 3. Let's tentatively identify these substances.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Hypothesis with Other Clues**\n\nIf A = I₂, F = HCl, and G = HIO₃, then C must be an iodine chloride. The formula for iodine trichloride is ICl₃, which exists as a dimer, **I₂Cl₆**, a bright yellow solid. We will assume \"bright red\" is a slight inaccuracy or refers to a similar compound, and proceed with C = I₂Cl₆.\n\n*   **Clue 1 (Formation of C):** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C\n    *   I₂(s) + B(g) → I₂Cl₆(s)\n    *   The balanced reaction is I₂(s) + 3 Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s).\n    *   This implies that **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The stoichiometry in the problem is 1:8, while the reaction requires a 1:3 ratio. This is a significant discrepancy. In such puzzles, sometimes the numbers are incorrect or refer to something non-obvious. We will note this discrepancy but continue, as the chemical fit of the hydrolysis reaction is very strong.\n\n*   **Clue 4 (Formation of H):** D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1)\n    *   D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)\n    *   There are two common reactions that fit this pattern:\n        *   CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l) (Phosgene, a solvent and reagent).\n        *   SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) (Sulfuryl chloride, a solvent and reagent).\n    *   So, D is either CO or SO₂.\n\n*   **Clue 2 (Formation of E):** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   We need to test both possibilities for D.\n    *   **Case 1: D = CO.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 CO → E. This reaction is not standard and is unlikely to produce a single, well-known hazardous product.\n    *   **Case 2: D = SO₂.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 SO₂ → E. I₂Cl₆ (or ICl₃) is a strong oxidizing agent. SO₂ is a reducing agent. However, the reaction 2ICl₃ + 2SO₂ → I₂ + 2SO₂Cl₂ produces two products, not a single product E.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluation and Alternative Hypotheses**\n\nThe I₂/ICl₃ hypothesis, while fitting Clue 3 perfectly, runs into significant problems with stoichiometry and the reaction to form E. Let's consider another approach, starting from the possible answers for the symmetry of E.\n\n*   The option **D4h** corresponds to a square planar geometry. The most famous example of a simple, neutral, extremely hazardous molecule with D4h symmetry is **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**.\n*   Let's assume **E = XeF₄**.\n    *   **Clue 2:** C + 2 D(g) → XeF₄. The most direct synthesis is Xe(g) + 2 F₂(g) → XeF₄(s). This would imply **C = Xe** and **D = F₂**.\n    *   **Let's test this:**\n        *   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(Xe). This reaction to produce Xenon from a solid A is highly exotic (nuclear or decomposition of a complex compound). Also, C is described as a \"bright red product,\" whereas Xenon is a colorless gas. This is a major contradiction.\n        *   **Clue 3:** C(Xe) + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong) + G(weak). Xenon does not react with water to produce acids and a solid. This is a fatal flaw in the hypothesis.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion Path**\n\nBoth of the most promising chemical pathways lead to contradictions, which is common in complex chemical puzzles. This suggests either the problem statement is flawed, or it relies on very obscure chemistry. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\n*   The hydrolysis reaction (Clue 3) has a near-perfect chemical match with the iodine chloride system. The issues with this path are stoichiometry and the final reaction to make E.\n*   The final product properties (hazardous, D4h symmetry) have a near-perfect match with XeF₄. The issues with this path are the formation and reaction properties of C.\n\nIn such puzzles, the question being asked is often the most reliable clue. The question is about the **molecular symmetry of E**. The D4h option points strongly to XeF₄. It is plausible that the puzzle was constructed around this specific molecule, and the other clues were created to be challenging, even to the point of being slightly inconsistent. Given that XeF₄ is the canonical example of a hazardous D4h molecule, it is the most probable intended identity for E.\n\nTherefore, assuming E is XeF₄, its molecular symmetry group is D4h.\n\nFinal check of the geometry of XeF₄:\n*   Xenon is the central atom.\n*   It has 4 bonding pairs (to F) and 2 lone pairs.\n*   VSEPR theory predicts an octahedral arrangement of electron pairs.\n*   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy opposite (axial) positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into a square planar arrangement in the equatorial plane.\n*   This geometry belongs to the D4h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis chemical puzzle can be solved by systematically identifying each substance.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:** The fourth clue states that gas B and gas D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. A well-known industrial reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂). Phosgene is a liquid at room temperature and can be used as a solvent.\n    *   **B = CO (Carbon Monoxide)**\n    *   **D = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n    *   **H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n2.  **Identify E:** The second clue states that product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (Cl₂) to produce the extremely hazardous product E. Phosgene is known to be an extremely hazardous and toxic gas. Given the reactants involved (a carbonyl complex C and chlorine D), it is highly plausible that the hazardous product E is also phosgene.\n    *   **E = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n3.  **Identify F and G:** The third clue describes the hydrolysis of C: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). Since C is formed from A and B (CO), the hydrolysis of the carbonyl ligands (CO) would produce carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which is a weak acid. The strong acid, F, must therefore originate from component A.\n    *   **G = H₂CO₃ (Carbonic acid)**\n    *   **F = A strong acid**, likely HCl, meaning A is a chloride.\n\n4.  **Identify A and C:** The first clue states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (CO) to form the bright red product C. The hydrolysis of C must reform A. This suggests C is a carbonyl complex of A. While the exact identities of A and C are part of a complex puzzle, the identity of E can be determined with high confidence from the other clues.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The extremely hazardous product E has been identified as phosgene (COCl₂). To find its molecular symmetry group, we analyze its structure.\n    *   Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   The molecule is planar, with a trigonal planar geometry around the central carbon atom.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ): one is the plane containing all the atoms, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 4**\n*   **Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   A very common reaction between two gases that forms a liquid solvent is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas.\n*   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) -> COCl₂ (liquid, phosgene)\n*   Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (carbon monoxide)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (phosgene)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 3**\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n*   If B is Cl₂, then C must be a chloride compound. The hydrolysis of a chloride typically produces hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   HCl is a strong acid, so we can identify **F = HCl**.\n*   The reaction also regenerates the solid starting material A and produces a weak acid G. This suggests that the hydrolysis is a disproportionation reaction, where the central element in C is both reduced (back to A) and oxidized (to form the weak oxyacid G).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (gas) -> C (bright red product).\n*   Substituting B = Cl₂, we have: A (solid) + 8 Cl₂ (gas) -> C (bright red).\n*   The 1:8 molar ratio is a very strong clue. Let's consider elements that exist as stable polyatomic molecules in their solid state. Sulfur is a prime candidate, with its most stable allotrope being rhombic sulfur, S₈.\n*   Let's test the reaction with **A = S₈**.\n*   S₈ (s) + 8 Cl₂ (g) -> 8 SCl₂\n*   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and fits the \"1 to 8 equivalents\" description perfectly.\n*   Now let's check the product C. **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identities with Reaction 3 again**\n*   Let's check if the hydrolysis of C = SCl₂ matches the products.\n*   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is complex but is known to disproportionate. A representative equation is:\n    3 SCl₂ + 4 H₂O -> 2 S + H₂SO₃ + 6 HCl\n*   Let's check the products against our deductions:\n    *   **A = S** (elemental sulfur), which is a solid. This matches the regeneration of A (S₈ is just the allotrope).\n    *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), a strong acid. This matches.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid. This matches.\n*   All compounds identified so far (A=S₈, B=Cl₂, C=SCl₂, D=CO, F=HCl, G=H₂SO₃, H=COCl₂) are consistent with the first three reactions.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Reaction 2 and Identify E**\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 equivalents of D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous product).\n*   Substituting our identified compounds: SCl₂ + 2 CO -> E.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two products: phosgene (COCl₂) and carbonyl sulfide (SCO).\n    SCl₂ + 2 CO -> COCl₂ + SCO\n*   The problem states this reaction produces \"the extremely hazardous product E\" and asks for its molecular symmetry group, implying E is a single molecular species. Phosgene (COCl₂) is well-known for being an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is toxic, but phosgene better fits the description. Furthermore, we need to find the symmetry group of E from the given options.\n*   Let's assume **E = COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   Molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   Its structure is trigonal planar, with the carbon atom at the center, double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    2.  A vertical mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the plane of the molecule).\n    3.  A second vertical mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the first plane and also contains the C₂ axis (bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n*   A molecule with an identity element (E), one C₂ axis, and two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nFinal check on the other product: Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is a linear molecule (O=C=S). It has a C∞ axis but no center of inversion or horizontal mirror plane, so its point group is C∞v, which is not among the options. This reinforces the conclusion that E is phosgene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core chemical reactions.**\n    The problem describes a series of reactions involving unknown substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n    *   (1) A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C (bright red)\n    *   (2) C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   (3) C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   (4) D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent) [1:1 ratio]\n\n2.  **Identify B, D, and H.**\n    Reaction (4) is a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A very common example of such a reaction is the formation of sulfuryl chloride:\n    SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)\n    Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a liquid and is used as a solvent in chemistry. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's assume: **B = SO₂** (sulfur dioxide), **D = Cl₂** (chlorine), and **H = SO₂Cl₂** (sulfuryl chloride).\n\n3.  **Identify G.**\n    Reaction (3) involves the hydrolysis of C to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Since C is formed from A and B (SO₂), it's highly likely that the hydrolysis of the SO₂ part of the molecule C yields the weak acid.\n    SO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂SO₃ (sulfurous acid)\n    Sulfurous acid is a weak acid.\n    *   So, **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the formation and hydrolysis of C.**\n    *   Reaction (3) states that C hydrolyzes to regenerate A, along with acids F and G. This suggests that C is a complex or adduct containing A and B (SO₂).\n    *   The formation of a strong acid F, which is different from G, implies that A is likely a salt, probably a halide, such that its corresponding hydrohalic acid (a strong acid) is formed. For example, if A is an iodide salt (like KI), F could be HI (hydroiodic acid).\n\n5.  **Identify E.**\n    The main question is about the molecular symmetry of E. Let's focus on Reaction (2):\n    C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    Substituting our identified species D = Cl₂:\n    C + 2 Cl₂ -> E\n    The stoichiometry, requiring exactly **2 equivalents** of Cl₂, is a major clue. Let's consider what kind of reaction this could be. A reaction of an iodide salt with excess chlorine proceeds in two steps:\n    Step 1: 2 MI + Cl₂ -> 2 MCl + I₂\n    Step 2: I₂ + Cl₂ -> 2 ICl\n    Overall: MI + Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl (This uses 1 equivalent of Cl₂)\n    However, if more chlorine is used:\n    ICl + Cl₂ -> ICl₃\n    Combining these, the overall reaction from an iodide salt is:\n    **MI + 2 Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl₃**\n    This reaction consumes exactly 2 equivalents of Cl₂ per equivalent of the iodide salt MI. This perfectly matches the stoichiometry of Reaction (2).\n    *   This strongly suggests that **E = ICl₃** (iodine trichloride).\n    *   ICl₃ is a powerful oxidizing agent and is indeed an \"extremely hazardous\" substance.\n    *   This implies that C, whatever its complex structure is, acts as a source of iodide for this reaction. This is consistent with A being an iodide salt (e.g., KI).\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (ICl₃).**\n    *   To find the point group of ICl₃, we use VSEPR theory.\n    *   The central atom is Iodine (I).\n    *   Valence electrons of I = 7.\n    *   Electrons from 3 Cl atoms = 3 × 1 = 3.\n    *   Total valence electrons = 7 + 3 = 10.\n    *   This corresponds to 5 electron pairs around the central iodine atom.\n    *   The electron geometry is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   There are 3 bonding pairs (I-Cl bonds) and 2 lone pairs.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions. The three chlorine atoms occupy the two axial positions and the remaining equatorial position.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n    *   A T-shaped molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation and two vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   The point group for this symmetry is **C₂v**.\n\n7.  **Final Check.**\n    Our deduction leads to E = ICl₃, which has C₂v symmetry. This is option D. The other clues, while not perfectly reconcilable without resorting to obscure chemistry (the \"bright red\" color and the \"8 equivalents\" for C are likely distractors or refer to a very specific, non-standard system), the deduction based on the clear stoichiometry of Reaction (2) provides a solid path to the answer.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ICl₃) is C₂v.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a step-by-step deduction that reconciles the chemical clues, even with known inconsistencies in this classic riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify A, B, C, F, G:** The most specific clue is the hydrolysis reaction (C + H₂O → A + F + G). This points to a disproportionation. The reaction involving iodine chlorides fits best:\n    *   **A**: I₂ (Iodine, a solid)\n    *   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine, a gas)\n    *   **C**: I₂Cl₆ (Iodine trichloride dimer, which is bright yellow, not red—a known flaw in the riddle)\n    *   **F**: HCl (a strong acid)\n    *   **G**: HIO₃ (Iodic acid, a weak acid)\n\n2.  **Identify D and H:** The reaction of two gases (D + B) in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) points to the synthesis of phosgene.\n    *   **D**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n3.  **Identify E:** The reaction of C with 2 equivalents of D produces the \"extremely hazardous\" product E.\n    *   Reaction: I₂Cl₆ + 2CO → 2ICl + 2COCl₂\n    *   The extremely hazardous product, **E**, is **COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (COCl₂):**\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis that runs along the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two σv planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    *   Reaction 1: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   Reaction 2: C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n    *   Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio\n\n2.  **Identify the Substances:** This chemical puzzle can be solved by systematically identifying the components. The synthesis of mustard gas provides a consistent fit for all the described reactions.\n\n    *   **Identify D, B, and H:** Let's test the hypothesis that this series of reactions describes the synthesis of mustard gas. The synthesis of the solvent 1,2-dichloroethane (H) from ethene (D) and chlorine (B) is a well-known industrial process.\n        *   **D = Ethene (C₂H₄)**, a gas.\n        *   **B = Chlorine (Cl₂)**, a gas.\n        *   **H = 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**, a common solvent.\n        *   Reaction 4: C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a 1:1 reaction, fitting the description.\n\n    *   **Identify A and C:** Now using B = Cl₂, let's look at Reaction 1.\n        *   A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C (bright red product).\n        *   The 1:8 stoichiometry is a major clue. Sulfur exists as a crown-shaped S₈ molecule, which is a solid. The reaction of elemental sulfur with chlorine is:\n        *   S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n        *   This reaction fits the 1:8 stoichiometry perfectly if we consider the molecular form of sulfur.\n        *   Therefore, **A = S₈** and **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid. The description of C as a solid might be a slight inaccuracy in the riddle, or it could refer to the substance at a lower temperature.\n\n    *   **Identify E:** Now we can deduce E from Reaction 2.\n        *   C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n        *   SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E.\n        *   This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n        *   SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S(l). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. So, **E = Mustard Gas**.\n\n    *   **Verify with Reaction 3:** Let's check the hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n        *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is complex, but it is known to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid. It also produces elemental sulfur.\n        *   2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S.\n        *   This fits the products: **F = HCl** (strong acid), **G = H₂SO₃** (weak acid), and the regeneration of elemental sulfur (**A**).\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E has been identified as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   This molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the C-C and C-S single bonds.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group, which typically refers to the point group of the molecule in its most stable conformation.\n    *   While the molecule can exist in many shapes, its lowest energy conformations lack high symmetry. The most stable conformers possess **C₂ symmetry**. A C₂ axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the angle between the two ethyl chloride groups.\n    *   The molecule does not possess the vertical mirror planes required for C₂ᵥ symmetry, nor the higher symmetry of D₄h or D∞h groups.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle where several clues have apparent contradictions with common chemical knowledge. A step-by-step deduction, prioritizing the most unique chemical reactions, is necessary to identify the unknown substances.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:** The reaction `D + B -> H` in a 1:1 ratio, where H is a solvent, strongly suggests the formation of phosgene.\n    *   **B** is Chlorine gas (Cl₂).\n    *   **D** is Carbon Monoxide (CO).\n    *   **H** is Phosgene (COCl₂).\n\n2.  **Identify A, C, F, and G:** The most chemically distinctive clue is the hydrolysis of C: `C + H₂O -> A + F + G`.\n    *   **F** is stated to be a strong acid. Since C is a chloride (formed from B=Cl₂), **F** is Hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n    *   **G** is a weak acid containing the element A.\n    *   **A** is a solid element that is reformed during the hydrolysis. This indicates a disproportionation reaction, where the element in compound C is both reduced back to its elemental state (A) and oxidized to form a weak acid (G).\n    *   This specific type of disproportionation is characteristic of Gold(I) chloride (AuCl). When AuCl reacts with water, it disproportionates to form metallic gold (Au) and gold(III) hydroxide (Au(OH)₃, also known as auric acid), which is a weak acid, along with hydrochloric acid.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **A** = Gold (Au)\n        *   **C** = Gold(I) chloride (AuCl). AuCl is a yellow solid, which is a slight contradiction to the \"bright red\" description, possibly an inaccuracy in the puzzle.\n        *   **G** = Auric acid (Au(OH)₃).\n\n3.  **Address Contradictions:** The first reaction, `A (solid) + 8 equivalents of gas B -> C`, does not match the actual synthesis of AuCl from Au and Cl₂ (2Au + Cl₂ -> 2AuCl). This significant discrepancy in stoichiometry is likely an error or a \"red herring\" in the puzzle statement. Given the uniqueness of the hydrolysis reaction, we proceed with the identification of A and C as Au and AuCl.\n\n4.  **Identify E:** The final unknown, E, is formed from the reaction `C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> E`.\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `AuCl + 2 CO -> E`.\n    *   Gold(I) chloride is known to react with carbon monoxide. While the most common product is Au(CO)Cl (a 1:1 adduct), the formation of a dicarbonyl species, **Au(CO)₂Cl**, is plausible under certain conditions and fits the 2-equivalent stoichiometry given.\n    *   This compound, dicarbonylchlorogold(I), is unstable and, like many heavy metal carbonyls, can be considered hazardous.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The task is to find the molecular symmetry group of E = Au(CO)₂Cl.\n    *   As a Gold(I) complex, the central gold atom is three-coordinate. The most stable geometry for such a complex is trigonal planar.\n    *   The molecule has the structure of a central Au atom bonded to one Cl atom and two CO groups.\n    *   This arrangement results in a planar molecule with a twofold rotational axis (C₂) passing through the Au-Cl bond and a plane of symmetry containing the molecule. This combination of symmetry elements corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group. Theoretical calculations confirm this geometry.\n\nFinal Answer is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio. A plausible reaction that fits this description is the synthesis of 1,2-dichloroethane, a solvent.\n    *   C₂H₄ (ethene) + Cl₂ (chlorine) → C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine gas)\n        *   **D = C₂H₄** (ethene gas)\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane solvent)\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (Cl₂) → C (bright red product).\n    *   We are looking for a solid A that reacts with a large amount of chlorine to form a red product C. Let's consider elemental sulfur.\n    *   **A = S₈** (elemental sulfur is a solid).\n    *   The reaction S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂ uses 1 mole of S₈ and 8 moles of Cl₂. This matches the 1:8 stoichiometry if we consider one mole of the S₈ ring.\n    *   The product is **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride), which is a cherry-red liquid. We'll assume the puzzle allows for a liquid product described as \"bright red product C\".\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** C (SCl₂) + H₂O → A (S₈) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n    *   The hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides is complex but is known to produce elemental sulfur, hydrochloric acid, and sulfur dioxide.\n    *   SCl₂ reacts with water, ultimately producing:\n        *   Elemental sulfur, which is solid **A (S₈)**, thus reforming the starting material.\n        *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), which is a strong acid.\n        *   SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), which dissolves in water to form **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the description.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** C (SCl₂) + 2 equivalents of D (C₂H₄) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of mustard gas.\n    *   **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S** (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, or mustard gas). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E is mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   To determine its point group, we must consider its three-dimensional shape. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We consider its most stable, highest-symmetry conformation.\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. It is not planar.\n    *   The only symmetry element present in the stable conformation of the molecule is a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule that only possesses an identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C2** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of the extremely hazardous product E (mustard gas) is C2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step debate to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n### Self-Debate\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nMy initial approach is to decode the chemical identities of the substances starting with the most concrete clues.\n\n1.  **Clue 3 & 4 Analysis:**\n    *   Clue 4 states that two gases, B and D, react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, H. A common reaction that fits this is 2NO₂ ⇌ N₂O₄. Here, gas B and gas D are both NO₂, and the solvent H is dinitrogen tetroxide (N₂O₄), which is a liquid solvent.\n    *   Clue 3 states that C reacts with water to form A, a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G). If we test our hypothesis that B is NO₂, the hydrolysis of NO₂ in water produces both nitric acid (HNO₃, a strong acid) and nitrous acid (HNO₂, a weak acid). This perfectly matches the description of F and G.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis:**\n    *   **B** = NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **D** = NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **H** = N₂O₄ (Dinitrogen tetroxide)\n    *   **F** = HNO₃ (Nitric acid)\n    *   **G** = HNO₂ (Nitrous acid)\n\n3.  **Proposed Action:**\n    Based on this strong evidence, I will proceed assuming these identities are correct and attempt to identify the hazardous product E. The remaining clues describe the formation of E:\n    *   A(s) + 8NO₂(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   C + 2NO₂(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n\nThis means E is the result of a reaction between solid A and a total of 10 equivalents of NO₂. E must be a nitrogen-containing compound. A plausible, hazardous nitrogen oxide that can be formed is dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅). I will now search for the molecular symmetry of N₂O₅.\n\n**Role: Skeptic**\nThe Proposer's case hinges on the identification of B and D as NO₂. While this is a strong inference, the subsequent leap to identifying E as N₂O₅ is based on plausibility rather than direct evidence from the clues. The core weakness is the unknown reaction pathway: A(s) + 10NO₂(g) → E. Without knowing what A and C are, we cannot be certain that E is N₂O₅. The puzzle could have a different solution if our initial deduction about B and D is a clever misdirection.\n\nHowever, the search results confirm that gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅) is a known hazardous compound. More importantly, multiple sources state that its equilibrium structure in the gas phase has **C2 symmetry**. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nThe Skeptic's point is valid; the chain of deduction has a weak link regarding the specific reaction. However, in the context of a well-posed puzzle, the elegance with which B=D=NO₂ solves two major, independent clues (the specific acid products and the solvent formation) is too powerful to ignore. The puzzle is likely designed around this central deduction. The subsequent steps (A→C→E) may involve obscure chemistry intended to be opaque, forcing the solver to identify the most logical hazardous product, E, based on the established reactants. N₂O₅ is a hazardous nitrogen oxide, and its gaseous C2 symmetry is a perfect fit for the options.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe debate converges. The evidence strongly supports the identification of B and D as NO₂. The most logical hazardous product, E, that could be formed and matches a symmetry option is N₂O₅. The molecular symmetry group for gaseous N₂O₅ is C2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Puzzle's Clues\n\nThe puzzle provides four key reactions and several properties:\n1.  **Reaction 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n2.  **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n3.  **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n4.  **Reaction 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio\n\nThe goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E from the options: A) D4h, B) C2v, C) C2, D) D∞h.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Main Hypotheses from the Candidate Answers\n\nThe candidate answers propose several distinct chemical systems to solve the puzzle. The two most coherent and frequently proposed systems are evaluated here.\n\n#### Hypothesis A: The Sulfur/Mustard Gas Pathway\nThis pathway is detailed in answers 4, 10, and 12.\n\n*   **Identification of substances:**\n    *   **A = S₈** (Rhombic sulfur is a solid).\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine is a gas).\n    *   **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene is a gas).\n    *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane is a solvent). The reaction C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l) fits the 1:1 ratio in **Reaction 4**.\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid). The reaction S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂ perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry in **Reaction 1**.\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid) and **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid). The hydrolysis of SCl₂ produces elemental sulfur (reforming A), HCl, and SO₂ (which forms H₂SO₃ in water), perfectly matching **Reaction 3**.\n    *   **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S** (Mustard gas). The reaction SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S is the well-known Levinstein process. It matches the 1:2 stoichiometry of **Reaction 2** and the description of E as \"extremely hazardous\".\n\n*   **Conclusion for Hypothesis A:** This pathway provides a consistent and chemically accurate explanation for every single clue in the puzzle, including the specific stoichiometries.\n\n#### Hypothesis B: The Phosgene Pathway\nThis pathway is the basis for answers 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.\n\n*   **Identification of substances:**\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine is a gas).\n    *   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide is a gas).\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene is a solvent). The reaction CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l) fits the 1:1 ratio in **Reaction 4**.\n    *   **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene is also extremely hazardous).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Hypothesis B:** This pathway strongly explains Reaction 4 and the hazardous nature of E. However, it struggles to coherently explain the other reactions. For example, Reaction 2 becomes `C + 2CO → COCl₂`. Identifying a substance 'C' that cleanly undergoes this reaction while also fitting the complex hydrolysis in Reaction 3 and the 1:8 formation in Reaction 1 is problematic. Some answers combine this with the sulfur chemistry (C=SCl₂), but the reaction `SCl₂ + 2CO` produces two products (COCl₂ and SCO), which contradicts the implication of a single product \"E\".\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Hypotheses and Determine the Identity of E\n\nThe Sulfur/Mustard Gas pathway (Hypothesis A) is superior as it provides a single, robust explanation for all clues without contradictions. The Phosgene pathway (Hypothesis B) is less consistent. Therefore, the most logical identity for the hazardous product E is **mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\n*   **Molecule:** E = Mustard Gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. Due to the lone pairs on the sulfur, the C-S-C bond is bent. The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the single bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** In its most stable, lowest-energy conformation, the molecule is not planar and lacks mirror planes or an inversion center. Its only symmetry element (besides the identity element) is a **two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) ** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule possessing only a single C₂ axis of symmetry belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n\nThe most consistent chemical deduction identifies E as mustard gas. The molecular symmetry group for mustard gas is C₂. This corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of product E, which is identified as Iodine Trifluoride (IF₃).\n\nTo determine the symmetry, we use VSEPR theory:\n1.  The central atom is Iodine (I), which has 7 valence electrons.\n2.  It forms single bonds with 3 Fluorine (F) atoms, contributing 3 electrons.\n3.  The total number of valence shell electrons is 7 + 3 = 10, which corresponds to 5 electron pairs.\n4.  The electron geometry for 5 pairs is trigonal bipyramidal.\n5.

Let's break down the clues to find the identity of the extremely hazardous product E and its molecular symmetry.\n\n**1. Identifying the Common Reactants (B, D, H, F, G):**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** The reaction of two common gases, B and D, in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) strongly suggests the formation of phosgene. So:\n    *   Gas B is **Chlorine (Cl₂)**.\n    *   Gas D is **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**.\n    *   Solvent H is **Phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product C reacts with water to reform solid A and two acids, F and G.\n    *   Since C is formed from a reaction involving chlorine (B), its hydrolysis will produce a strong acid F, which must be **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**.\n    *   Acid G is described as weak. The hydrolysis of salts or non-metal halides often produces a weak acid alongside a strong one.\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Reaction and Product E:**\n\nThe puzzle's remaining reactions are:\n*   **Reaction 1:** Solid A + 8 Cl₂ (B) → Bright red product C.\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 CO (D) → Extremely hazardous product E.\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A + HCl (F) + G (weak acid).\n\nThe clues, particularly the regeneration of A and the unusual stoichiometry, point to a very specific and somewhat obscure chemical system. While the reaction scheme is difficult to resolve completely without ambiguity, we can deduce the likely identity of E by focusing on Reaction 2 and the nature of hazardous chemical products.\n\nThe reaction `C + 2 CO → E` suggests that E is a carbonyl compound. A plausible, though not definitively proven, candidate for E that fits the description of \"extremely hazardous\" and can be formed from a reaction involving chlorine and carbon monoxide is **Oxalyl Chloride ((COCl)₂)**.\n\n**3. Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n\nLet's assume E is Oxalyl Chloride. Its structure is Cl-C(=O)-C(=O)-Cl. This molecule can exist in several conformations. The two most stable are the *trans* and *cis* planar forms. The *cis* conformer, where both C=O bonds and both C-Cl bonds are on the same side of the C-C bond, possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two vertical mirror planes.\n\nThe symmetry elements for cis-Oxalyl Chloride are:\n*   An identity element (E).\n*   A two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that bisects the C-C bond.\n*   Two vertical planes of reflection (σᵥ), one being the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nA molecule with these symmetry elements belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group. This point group is very common for bent or V-shaped molecules like water (H₂O), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and phosgene (COCl₂).\n\nGiven the options, C₂ᵥ is the most chemically plausible symmetry for the hazardous product E.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis chemical riddle can be solved by identifying the substances involved in each reaction.\n\n1.  **Reaction 4: D + B → H (1:1 ratio, H is a solvent)**\n    This strongly suggests a well-known industrial reaction. Two common possibilities for a 1:1 reaction between two gases to form a liquid solvent are:\n    *   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → COCl₂ (liquid, phosgene)\n    *   SO₂ (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) → SO₂Cl₂ (liquid, sulfuryl chloride)\n\n2.  **Identifying E and its Symmetry**\n    The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E, which is described as an \"extremely hazardous product.\" Both phosgene (COCl₂) and sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) are hazardous liquids that are used as solvents. It is plausible that the hazardous product E is the same as the solvent H.\n\n    *   **If E is phosgene (COCl₂):** This molecule is planar. It has a C₂ axis of rotation along the C=O bond and two vertical mirror planes. This corresponds to the **C2v** point group.\n    *   **If E is sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂):** This molecule has a distorted tetrahedral shape. It possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two mirror planes, which also places it in the **C2v** point group.\n\n    Since both logical candidates for product E have C2v symmetry, we can confidently determine the answer without needing to resolve the more complex or potentially flawed clues in the other reactions. The remaining clues about the \"bright red product C\" and its hydrolysis appear to be inconsistent with simple, well-known chemical reactions, but they are not necessary to identify the symmetry of E.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants B, D, and Product H:**\n    *   Reaction 4 states that gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. A classic example of this is the reaction of ethylene (C₂H₄) with chlorine (Cl₂) to produce 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), a common solvent.\n    *   Let's assume:\n        *   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)\n        *   D = C₂H₄ (Ethylene gas)\n        *   H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n2.  **Identify Solid A and Product C:**\n    *   Reaction 1 states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) to form the bright red product C.\n    *   Let's consider A to be elemental sulfur (S₈), which is a solid. Sulfur reacts with excess chlorine in a two-step process. The overall reaction can be written as S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂.\n    *   The product, sulfur dichloride (SCl₂), is described as a cherry-red liquid. This fits the description of a \"bright red product C\".\n    *   So, we can identify:\n        *   A = S₈ (Sulfur)\n        *   C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n\n3.  **Verify the Hydrolysis Reaction:**\n    *   Reaction 3 states that C reacts with water to reform A, plus a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n    *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a disproportionation reaction. A balanced equation for the reaction is 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S.\n    *   This reaction reforms elemental sulfur (A = S₈).\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid (F).\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (G).\n    *   This perfectly matches the description.\n\n4.  **Identify the Hazardous Product E:**\n    *   Reaction 2 states that C (SCl₂) reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (C₂H₄) to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\n    *   The product, bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, is commonly known as **mustard gas**, an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n    *   Therefore, E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard Gas).\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E, mustard gas.\n    *   The molecule has the structure Cl-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₂-CH₂-Cl. The C-S-C group is bent, similar to water, due to the lone pairs on the sulfur atom.\n    *   Due to rotational freedom around the single bonds, the molecule adopts a preferred low-energy conformation. This conformation is not planar.\n    *   The molecule lacks an inversion center and any mirror planes (σ).\n    *   However, it possesses a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. The two chloroethyl arms are positioned as rotational images of each other.\n    *   A molecule that has only a C₂ axis of symmetry belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nWe are given a series of reactions and properties for several unknown substances (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H).\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n2.  **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n3.  **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(acid, strong) + G(acid, weak)\n4.  **Reaction 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n5.  **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? The options are A) D∞h, B) C2, C) D4h, D) C2v.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Most Constraining Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 3 (Hydrolysis of C):** This is the most chemically specific clue. The reaction of C with water regenerates the solid starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The fact that A is reformed suggests that A is an element (likely a metal or metalloid) that is part of a complex or unstable compound C, and is released in its elemental form upon hydrolysis.\n    *   The formation of two different acids implies that the part of C that is not A (which comes from gas B) must contain at least two different non-metal elements that form acids upon hydrolysis.\n\n*   **A Plausible Chemical System for Clue 3:** A well-known reaction that fits this description is the hydrolysis of iodine trichloride (ICl₃).\n    *   5 ICl₃ + 9 H₂O → I₂(s) + 15 HCl(aq) + 3 HIO₃(aq)\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   **A = I₂** (Iodine is a solid at standard conditions). A is reformed.\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid).\n        *   **G = HIO₃** (Iodic acid is a weaker acid than HCl).\n    *   This system perfectly matches the description in Clue 3. Let's tentatively identify these substances.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Hypothesis with Other Clues**\n\nIf A = I₂, F = HCl, and G = HIO₃, then C must be an iodine chloride. The formula for iodine trichloride is ICl₃, which exists as a dimer, **I₂Cl₆**, a bright yellow solid. We will assume \"bright red\" is a slight inaccuracy or refers to a similar compound, and proceed with C = I₂Cl₆.\n\n*   **Clue 1 (Formation of C):** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C\n    *   I₂(s) + B(g) → I₂Cl₆(s)\n    *   The balanced reaction is I₂(s) + 3 Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s).\n    *   This implies that **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The stoichiometry in the problem is 1:8, while the reaction requires a 1:3 ratio. This is a significant discrepancy. In such puzzles, sometimes the numbers are incorrect or refer to something non-obvious. We will note this discrepancy but continue, as the chemical fit of the hydrolysis reaction is very strong.\n\n*   **Clue 4 (Formation of H):** D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1)\n    *   D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)\n    *   There are two common reactions that fit this pattern:\n        *   CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l) (Phosgene, a solvent and reagent).\n        *   SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) (Sulfuryl chloride, a solvent and reagent).\n    *   So, D is either CO or SO₂.\n\n*   **Clue 2 (Formation of E):** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   We need to test both possibilities for D.\n    *   **Case 1: D = CO.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 CO → E. This reaction is not standard and is unlikely to produce a single, well-known hazardous product.\n    *   **Case 2: D = SO₂.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 SO₂ → E. I₂Cl₆ (or ICl₃) is a strong oxidizing agent. SO₂ is a reducing agent. However, the reaction 2ICl₃ + 2SO₂ → I₂ + 2SO₂Cl₂ produces two products, not a single product E.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluation and Alternative Hypotheses**\n\nThe I₂/ICl₃ hypothesis, while fitting Clue 3 perfectly, runs into significant problems with stoichiometry and the reaction to form E. Let's consider another approach, starting from the possible answers for the symmetry of E.\n\n*   The option **D4h** corresponds to a square planar geometry. The most famous example of a simple, neutral, extremely hazardous molecule with D4h symmetry is **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**.\n*   Let's assume **E = XeF₄**.\n    *   **Clue 2:** C + 2 D(g) → XeF₄. The most direct synthesis is Xe(g) + 2 F₂(g) → XeF₄(s). This would imply **C = Xe** and **D = F₂**.\n    *   **Let's test this:**\n        *   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(Xe). This reaction to produce Xenon from a solid A is highly exotic (nuclear or decomposition of a complex compound). Also, C is described as a \"bright red product,\" whereas Xenon is a colorless gas. This is a major contradiction.\n        *   **Clue 3:** C(Xe) + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong) + G(weak). Xenon does not react with water to produce acids and a solid. This is a fatal flaw in the hypothesis.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion Path**\n\nBoth of the most promising chemical pathways lead to contradictions, which is common in complex chemical puzzles. This suggests either the problem statement is flawed, or it relies on very obscure chemistry. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\n*   The hydrolysis reaction (Clue 3) has a near-perfect chemical match with the iodine chloride system. The issues with this path are stoichiometry and the final reaction to make E.\n*   The final product properties (hazardous, D4h symmetry) have a near-perfect match with XeF₄. The issues with this path are the formation and reaction properties of C.\n\nIn such puzzles, the question being asked is often the most reliable clue. The question is about the **molecular symmetry of E**. The D4h option points strongly to XeF₄. It is plausible that the puzzle was constructed around this specific molecule, and the other clues were created to be challenging, even to the point of being slightly inconsistent. Given that XeF₄ is the canonical example of a hazardous D4h molecule, it is the most probable intended identity for E.\n\nTherefore, assuming E is XeF₄, its molecular symmetry group is D4h.\n\nFinal check of the geometry of XeF₄:\n*   Xenon is the central atom.\n*   It has 4 bonding pairs (to F) and 2 lone pairs.\n*   VSEPR theory predicts an octahedral arrangement of electron pairs.\n*   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy opposite (axial) positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into a square planar arrangement in the equatorial plane.\n*   This geometry belongs to the D4h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis chemical puzzle can be solved by systematically identifying each substance.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:** The fourth clue states that gas B and gas D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. A well-known industrial reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene (COCl₂) from carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂). Phosgene is a liquid at room temperature and can be used as a solvent.\n    *   **B = CO (Carbon Monoxide)**\n    *   **D = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n    *   **H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n2.  **Identify E:** The second clue states that product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (Cl₂) to produce the extremely hazardous product E. Phosgene is known to be an extremely hazardous and toxic gas. Given the reactants involved (a carbonyl complex C and chlorine D), it is highly plausible that the hazardous product E is also phosgene.\n    *   **E = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n3.  **Identify F and G:** The third clue describes the hydrolysis of C: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). Since C is formed from A and B (CO), the hydrolysis of the carbonyl ligands (CO) would produce carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which is a weak acid. The strong acid, F, must therefore originate from component A.\n    *   **G = H₂CO₃ (Carbonic acid)**\n    *   **F = A strong acid**, likely HCl, meaning A is a chloride.\n\n4.  **Identify A and C:** The first clue states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (CO) to form the bright red product C. The hydrolysis of C must reform A. This suggests C is a carbonyl complex of A. While the exact identities of A and C are part of a complex puzzle, the identity of E can be determined with high confidence from the other clues.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The extremely hazardous product E has been identified as phosgene (COCl₂). To find its molecular symmetry group, we analyze its structure.\n    *   Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   The molecule is planar, with a trigonal planar geometry around the central carbon atom.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ): one is the plane containing all the atoms, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 4**\n*   **Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   A very common reaction between two gases that forms a liquid solvent is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas.\n*   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) -> COCl₂ (liquid, phosgene)\n*   Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (carbon monoxide)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (phosgene)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 3**\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n*   If B is Cl₂, then C must be a chloride compound. The hydrolysis of a chloride typically produces hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   HCl is a strong acid, so we can identify **F = HCl**.\n*   The reaction also regenerates the solid starting material A and produces a weak acid G. This suggests that the hydrolysis is a disproportionation reaction, where the central element in C is both reduced (back to A) and oxidized (to form the weak oxyacid G).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (gas) -> C (bright red product).\n*   Substituting B = Cl₂, we have: A (solid) + 8 Cl₂ (gas) -> C (bright red).\n*   The 1:8 molar ratio is a very strong clue. Let's consider elements that exist as stable polyatomic molecules in their solid state. Sulfur is a prime candidate, with its most stable allotrope being rhombic sulfur, S₈.\n*   Let's test the reaction with **A = S₈**.\n*   S₈ (s) + 8 Cl₂ (g) -> 8 SCl₂\n*   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and fits the \"1 to 8 equivalents\" description perfectly.\n*   Now let's check the product C. **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identities with Reaction 3 again**\n*   Let's check if the hydrolysis of C = SCl₂ matches the products.\n*   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is complex but is known to disproportionate. A representative equation is:\n    3 SCl₂ + 4 H₂O -> 2 S + H₂SO₃ + 6 HCl\n*   Let's check the products against our deductions:\n    *   **A = S** (elemental sulfur), which is a solid. This matches the regeneration of A (S₈ is just the allotrope).\n    *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), a strong acid. This matches.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid. This matches.\n*   All compounds identified so far (A=S₈, B=Cl₂, C=SCl₂, D=CO, F=HCl, G=H₂SO₃, H=COCl₂) are consistent with the first three reactions.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Reaction 2 and Identify E**\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 equivalents of D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous product).\n*   Substituting our identified compounds: SCl₂ + 2 CO -> E.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two products: phosgene (COCl₂) and carbonyl sulfide (SCO).\n    SCl₂ + 2 CO -> COCl₂ + SCO\n*   The problem states this reaction produces \"the extremely hazardous product E\" and asks for its molecular symmetry group, implying E is a single molecular species. Phosgene (COCl₂) is well-known for being an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is toxic, but phosgene better fits the description. Furthermore, we need to find the symmetry group of E from the given options.\n*   Let's assume **E = COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   Molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   Its structure is trigonal planar, with the carbon atom at the center, double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    2.  A vertical mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the plane of the molecule).\n    3.  A second vertical mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the first plane and also contains the C₂ axis (bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n*   A molecule with an identity element (E), one C₂ axis, and two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nFinal check on the other product: Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is a linear molecule (O=C=S). It has a C∞ axis but no center of inversion or horizontal mirror plane, so its point group is C∞v, which is not among the options. This reinforces the conclusion that E is phosgene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core chemical reactions.**\n    The problem describes a series of reactions involving unknown substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n    *   (1) A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C (bright red)\n    *   (2) C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   (3) C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   (4) D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent) [1:1 ratio]\n\n2.  **Identify B, D, and H.**\n    Reaction (4) is a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A very common example of such a reaction is the formation of sulfuryl chloride:\n    SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)\n    Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a liquid and is used as a solvent in chemistry. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's assume: **B = SO₂** (sulfur dioxide), **D = Cl₂** (chlorine), and **H = SO₂Cl₂** (sulfuryl chloride).\n\n3.  **Identify G.**\n    Reaction (3) involves the hydrolysis of C to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Since C is formed from A and B (SO₂), it's highly likely that the hydrolysis of the SO₂ part of the molecule C yields the weak acid.\n    SO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂SO₃ (sulfurous acid)\n    Sulfurous acid is a weak acid.\n    *   So, **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the formation and hydrolysis of C.**\n    *   Reaction (3) states that C hydrolyzes to regenerate A, along with acids F and G. This suggests that C is a complex or adduct containing A and B (SO₂).\n    *   The formation of a strong acid F, which is different from G, implies that A is likely a salt, probably a halide, such that its corresponding hydrohalic acid (a strong acid) is formed. For example, if A is an iodide salt (like KI), F could be HI (hydroiodic acid).\n\n5.  **Identify E.**\n    The main question is about the molecular symmetry of E. Let's focus on Reaction (2):\n    C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    Substituting our identified species D = Cl₂:\n    C + 2 Cl₂ -> E\n    The stoichiometry, requiring exactly **2 equivalents** of Cl₂, is a major clue. Let's consider what kind of reaction this could be. A reaction of an iodide salt with excess chlorine proceeds in two steps:\n    Step 1: 2 MI + Cl₂ -> 2 MCl + I₂\n    Step 2: I₂ + Cl₂ -> 2 ICl\n    Overall: MI + Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl (This uses 1 equivalent of Cl₂)\n    However, if more chlorine is used:\n    ICl + Cl₂ -> ICl₃\n    Combining these, the overall reaction from an iodide salt is:\n    **MI + 2 Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl₃**\n    This reaction consumes exactly 2 equivalents of Cl₂ per equivalent of the iodide salt MI. This perfectly matches the stoichiometry of Reaction (2).\n    *   This strongly suggests that **E = ICl₃** (iodine trichloride).\n    *   ICl₃ is a powerful oxidizing agent and is indeed an \"extremely hazardous\" substance.\n    *   This implies that C, whatever its complex structure is, acts as a source of iodide for this reaction. This is consistent with A being an iodide salt (e.g., KI).\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (ICl₃).**\n    *   To find the point group of ICl₃, we use VSEPR theory.\n    *   The central atom is Iodine (I).\n    *   Valence electrons of I = 7.\n    *   Electrons from 3 Cl atoms = 3 × 1 = 3.\n    *   Total valence electrons = 7 + 3 = 10.\n    *   This corresponds to 5 electron pairs around the central iodine atom.\n    *   The electron geometry is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   There are 3 bonding pairs (I-Cl bonds) and 2 lone pairs.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions. The three chlorine atoms occupy the two axial positions and the remaining equatorial position.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n    *   A T-shaped molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation and two vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   The point group for this symmetry is **C₂v**.\n\n7.  **Final Check.**\n    Our deduction leads to E = ICl₃, which has C₂v symmetry. This is option D. The other clues, while not perfectly reconcilable without resorting to obscure chemistry (the \"bright red\" color and the \"8 equivalents\" for C are likely distractors or refer to a very specific, non-standard system), the deduction based on the clear stoichiometry of Reaction (2) provides a solid path to the answer.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ICl₃) is C₂v.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a step-by-step deduction that reconciles the chemical clues, even with known inconsistencies in this classic riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify A, B, C, F, G:** The most specific clue is the hydrolysis reaction (C + H₂O → A + F + G). This points to a disproportionation. The reaction involving iodine chlorides fits best:\n    *   **A**: I₂ (Iodine, a solid)\n    *   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine, a gas)\n    *   **C**: I₂Cl₆ (Iodine trichloride dimer, which is bright yellow, not red—a known flaw in the riddle)\n    *   **F**: HCl (a strong acid)\n    *   **G**: HIO₃ (Iodic acid, a weak acid)\n\n2.  **Identify D and H:** The reaction of two gases (D + B) in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) points to the synthesis of phosgene.\n    *   **D**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n3.  **Identify E:** The reaction of C with 2 equivalents of D produces the \"extremely hazardous\" product E.\n    *   Reaction: I₂Cl₆ + 2CO → 2ICl + 2COCl₂\n    *   The extremely hazardous product, **E**, is **COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (COCl₂):**\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis that runs along the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two σv planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    *   Reaction 1: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   Reaction 2: C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n    *   Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio\n\n2.  **Identify the Substances:** This chemical puzzle can be solved by systematically identifying the components. The synthesis of mustard gas provides a consistent fit for all the described reactions.\n\n    *   **Identify D, B, and H:** Let's test the hypothesis that this series of reactions describes the synthesis of mustard gas. The synthesis of the solvent 1,2-dichloroethane (H) from ethene (D) and chlorine (B) is a well-known industrial process.\n        *   **D = Ethene (C₂H₄)**, a gas.\n        *   **B = Chlorine (Cl₂)**, a gas.\n        *   **H = 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**, a common solvent.\n        *   Reaction 4: C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a 1:1 reaction, fitting the description.\n\n    *   **Identify A and C:** Now using B = Cl₂, let's look at Reaction 1.\n        *   A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C (bright red product).\n        *   The 1:8 stoichiometry is a major clue. Sulfur exists as a crown-shaped S₈ molecule, which is a solid. The reaction of elemental sulfur with chlorine is:\n        *   S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n        *   This reaction fits the 1:8 stoichiometry perfectly if we consider the molecular form of sulfur.\n        *   Therefore, **A = S₈** and **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid. The description of C as a solid might be a slight inaccuracy in the riddle, or it could refer to the substance at a lower temperature.\n\n    *   **Identify E:** Now we can deduce E from Reaction 2.\n        *   C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n        *   SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E.\n        *   This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n        *   SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S(l). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. So, **E = Mustard Gas**.\n\n    *   **Verify with Reaction 3:** Let's check the hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n        *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is complex, but it is known to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid. It also produces elemental sulfur.\n        *   2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S.\n        *   This fits the products: **F = HCl** (strong acid), **G = H₂SO₃** (weak acid), and the regeneration of elemental sulfur (**A**).\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E has been identified as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   This molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the C-C and C-S single bonds.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group, which typically refers to the point group of the molecule in its most stable conformation.\n    *   While the molecule can exist in many shapes, its lowest energy conformations lack high symmetry. The most stable conformers possess **C₂ symmetry**. A C₂ axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the angle between the two ethyl chloride groups.\n    *   The molecule does not possess the vertical mirror planes required for C₂ᵥ symmetry, nor the higher symmetry of D₄h or D∞h groups.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle where several clues have apparent contradictions with common chemical knowledge. A step-by-step deduction, prioritizing the most unique chemical reactions, is necessary to identify the unknown substances.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:** The reaction `D + B -> H` in a 1:1 ratio, where H is a solvent, strongly suggests the formation of phosgene.\n    *   **B** is Chlorine gas (Cl₂).\n    *   **D** is Carbon Monoxide (CO).\n    *   **H** is Phosgene (COCl₂).\n\n2.  **Identify A, C, F, and G:** The most chemically distinctive clue is the hydrolysis of C: `C + H₂O -> A + F + G`.\n    *   **F** is stated to be a strong acid. Since C is a chloride (formed from B=Cl₂), **F** is Hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n    *   **G** is a weak acid containing the element A.\n    *   **A** is a solid element that is reformed during the hydrolysis. This indicates a disproportionation reaction, where the element in compound C is both reduced back to its elemental state (A) and oxidized to form a weak acid (G).\n    *   This specific type of disproportionation is characteristic of Gold(I) chloride (AuCl). When AuCl reacts with water, it disproportionates to form metallic gold (Au) and gold(III) hydroxide (Au(OH)₃, also known as auric acid), which is a weak acid, along with hydrochloric acid.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **A** = Gold (Au)\n        *   **C** = Gold(I) chloride (AuCl). AuCl is a yellow solid, which is a slight contradiction to the \"bright red\" description, possibly an inaccuracy in the puzzle.\n        *   **G** = Auric acid (Au(OH)₃).\n\n3.  **Address Contradictions:** The first reaction, `A (solid) + 8 equivalents of gas B -> C`, does not match the actual synthesis of AuCl from Au and Cl₂ (2Au + Cl₂ -> 2AuCl). This significant discrepancy in stoichiometry is likely an error or a \"red herring\" in the puzzle statement. Given the uniqueness of the hydrolysis reaction, we proceed with the identification of A and C as Au and AuCl.\n\n4.  **Identify E:** The final unknown, E, is formed from the reaction `C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> E`.\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `AuCl + 2 CO -> E`.\n    *   Gold(I) chloride is known to react with carbon monoxide. While the most common product is Au(CO)Cl (a 1:1 adduct), the formation of a dicarbonyl species, **Au(CO)₂Cl**, is plausible under certain conditions and fits the 2-equivalent stoichiometry given.\n    *   This compound, dicarbonylchlorogold(I), is unstable and, like many heavy metal carbonyls, can be considered hazardous.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The task is to find the molecular symmetry group of E = Au(CO)₂Cl.\n    *   As a Gold(I) complex, the central gold atom is three-coordinate. The most stable geometry for such a complex is trigonal planar.\n    *   The molecule has the structure of a central Au atom bonded to one Cl atom and two CO groups.\n    *   This arrangement results in a planar molecule with a twofold rotational axis (C₂) passing through the Au-Cl bond and a plane of symmetry containing the molecule. This combination of symmetry elements corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group. Theoretical calculations confirm this geometry.\n\nFinal Answer is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio. A plausible reaction that fits this description is the synthesis of 1,2-dichloroethane, a solvent.\n    *   C₂H₄ (ethene) + Cl₂ (chlorine) → C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine gas)\n        *   **D = C₂H₄** (ethene gas)\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane solvent)\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (Cl₂) → C (bright red product).\n    *   We are looking for a solid A that reacts with a large amount of chlorine to form a red product C. Let's consider elemental sulfur.\n    *   **A = S₈** (elemental sulfur is a solid).\n    *   The reaction S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂ uses 1 mole of S₈ and 8 moles of Cl₂. This matches the 1:8 stoichiometry if we consider one mole of the S₈ ring.\n    *   The product is **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride), which is a cherry-red liquid. We'll assume the puzzle allows for a liquid product described as \"bright red product C\".\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** C (SCl₂) + H₂O → A (S₈) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n    *   The hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides is complex but is known to produce elemental sulfur, hydrochloric acid, and sulfur dioxide.\n    *   SCl₂ reacts with water, ultimately producing:\n        *   Elemental sulfur, which is solid **A (S₈)**, thus reforming the starting material.\n        *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), which is a strong acid.\n        *   SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), which dissolves in water to form **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the description.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** C (SCl₂) + 2 equivalents of D (C₂H₄) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of mustard gas.\n    *   **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S** (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, or mustard gas). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E is mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   To determine its point group, we must consider its three-dimensional shape. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We consider its most stable, highest-symmetry conformation.\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. It is not planar.\n    *   The only symmetry element present in the stable conformation of the molecule is a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule that only possesses an identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C2** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of the extremely hazardous product E (mustard gas) is C2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step debate to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n### Self-Debate\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nMy initial approach is to decode the chemical identities of the substances starting with the most concrete clues.\n\n1.  **Clue 3 & 4 Analysis:**\n    *   Clue 4 states that two gases, B and D, react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, H. A common reaction that fits this is 2NO₂ ⇌ N₂O₄. Here, gas B and gas D are both NO₂, and the solvent H is dinitrogen tetroxide (N₂O₄), which is a liquid solvent.\n    *   Clue 3 states that C reacts with water to form A, a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G). If we test our hypothesis that B is NO₂, the hydrolysis of NO₂ in water produces both nitric acid (HNO₃, a strong acid) and nitrous acid (HNO₂, a weak acid). This perfectly matches the description of F and G.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis:**\n    *   **B** = NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **D** = NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **H** = N₂O₄ (Dinitrogen tetroxide)\n    *   **F** = HNO₃ (Nitric acid)\n    *   **G** = HNO₂ (Nitrous acid)\n\n3.  **Proposed Action:**\n    Based on this strong evidence, I will proceed assuming these identities are correct and attempt to identify the hazardous product E. The remaining clues describe the formation of E:\n    *   A(s) + 8NO₂(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   C + 2NO₂(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n\nThis means E is the result of a reaction between solid A and a total of 10 equivalents of NO₂. E must be a nitrogen-containing compound. A plausible, hazardous nitrogen oxide that can be formed is dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅). I will now search for the molecular symmetry of N₂O₅.\n\n**Role: Skeptic**\nThe Proposer's case hinges on the identification of B and D as NO₂. While this is a strong inference, the subsequent leap to identifying E as N₂O₅ is based on plausibility rather than direct evidence from the clues. The core weakness is the unknown reaction pathway: A(s) + 10NO₂(g) → E. Without knowing what A and C are, we cannot be certain that E is N₂O₅. The puzzle could have a different solution if our initial deduction about B and D is a clever misdirection.\n\nHowever, the search results confirm that gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅) is a known hazardous compound. More importantly, multiple sources state that its equilibrium structure in the gas phase has **C2 symmetry**. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nThe Skeptic's point is valid; the chain of deduction has a weak link regarding the specific reaction. However, in the context of a well-posed puzzle, the elegance with which B=D=NO₂ solves two major, independent clues (the specific acid products and the solvent formation) is too powerful to ignore. The puzzle is likely designed around this central deduction. The subsequent steps (A→C→E) may involve obscure chemistry intended to be opaque, forcing the solver to identify the most logical hazardous product, E, based on the established reactants. N₂O₅ is a hazardous nitrogen oxide, and its gaseous C2 symmetry is a perfect fit for the options.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe debate converges. The evidence strongly supports the identification of B and D as NO₂. The most logical hazardous product, E, that could be formed and matches a symmetry option is N₂O₅. The molecular symmetry group for gaseous N₂O₅ is C2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
