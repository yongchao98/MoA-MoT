Given,\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.\nBond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\nBond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe python script successfully calculated the enthalpy of formation for the given molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which has the molecular formula C12H22.\n\nThe calculation followed these steps:\n1.  **Energy Input (Reactant Atomization):** The energy required to convert the reactants (12 C(s) and 11 H2(g)) into gaseous atoms was calculated.\n    *   Energy = (12 mol C * 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 mol H2 * 100 kJ/mol) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ.\n2.  **Energy Output (Product Bond Formation):** The energy released upon forming all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule was calculated. The molecule contains 9 C-C bonds, 2 C=C bonds, and 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   Energy = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ.\n3.  **Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°):** The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy input and the energy output.\n    *   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = 1900 kJ/mol.\n4.  **Conversion to kJ/g:** To compare with the options, the value was converted from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass of C12H22 (12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol).\n    *   ΔHf° = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.45 kJ/g.\n\nThe calculated value of 11.45 kJ/g is a very close match to option A (11.44 kJ/g). The other options were identified as common distractors: option B is the total bond energy of the product, and option D uses the correct numerical value for kJ/mol but with incorrect units (kJ/g).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo solve this problem, we must first determine the number of each type of bond in the molecule and then use the given bond energies to calculate the total energy.\n\n**1. Molecular Structure and Bond Counting**\n\nThe chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure to count the atoms and bonds accurately:\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 22\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two `C=C` double bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** By drawing the structure and counting the single bonds between carbon atoms (both in the main chain and in the methyl branches), we find there are 9 C-C single bonds.\n\n**Bond Tally:**\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"enthalpy of formation\". However, based on the provided multiple-choice options, it is highly likely that the question is asking for the **enthalpy of atomization** of the compound. The enthalpy of atomization is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of a compound to form individual gaseous atoms. Let's calculate this value.\n\n**Enthalpy of Atomization (ΔH_atom) of the compound:**\nThis is the sum of the energies of all the bonds in the molecule.\n\nΔH_atom = (Number of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (Number of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (Number of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atom = 8800 + 1800 + 600\nΔH_atom = 11200 kJ/mol\n\nThis calculated value for the enthalpy of atomization matches option B exactly.\n\nFor completeness, the actual enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) would be calculated as follows:\n*   **Enthalpy of atomization of reactants:** This is the energy needed to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard state (11 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g)).\n    ΔH_atom(reactants) = (11 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n    ΔH_atom(reactants) = (11 × 1000) + (11 × 100) = 11000 + 1100 = 12100 kJ\n*   **Enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f):**\n    ΔH_f = ΔH_atom(reactants) - ΔH_atom(compound)\n    ΔH_f = 12100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 900 kJ/mol\n\nSince 900 kJ/mol is not an option and 11200 kJ/mol is, it is clear that the question intended to ask for the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpies of atomization. The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the compound into its constituent atoms and the energy required to form those atoms from their elements in their standard states.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** By counting the atoms, we find there are 12 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms. The formula is C12H22.\n*   **Molar Mass:** The approximate molar mass is (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Bond Analysis:** We need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** There are 9 C-C single bonds.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** There are 2 C=C double bonds.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds. This is calculated by summing the bond energies of all the bonds in one mole of the substance.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 mol × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 mol × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 mol × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) into gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g).\n\n*   Energy to atomize Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize Hydrogen = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol (for H-H bond) = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound's bonds are formed (which is the negative of the compound's enthalpy of atomization). The formula is:\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options provided are in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass (166 g/mol).\n\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n**2. List Careful Points:**\n*   **Correctly interpret the chemical structure:** The condensed formula must be translated into a full structural formula to accurately count the bonds.\n*   **Determine the molecular formula:** Count the total number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to find the molecular formula (CxHy).\n*   **Accurately count all bonds:** Systematically count the number of C-H, C-C (single), and C=C (double) bonds in the molecule. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Understand the definition of enthalpy of formation:** The enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n    `x C(s, graphite) + (y/2) H2(g) → CxHy(g)`\n*   **Apply Hess's Law:** The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the given bond energies and enthalpy of atomization data via a thermodynamic cycle (Hess's Law). The formula is:\n    `ΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]`\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the product:** This is the sum of all the bond energies in one mole of the product molecule.\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants:** This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states to gaseous atoms. For `x C(s)` and `(y/2) H2(g)`, this is `[x * ΔH_atom(C)] + [(y/2) * BE(H-H)]`.\n*   **Check the units:** The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. The initial calculation will yield a result in kJ/mol. If this doesn't match an option, it must be converted to kJ/g by dividing by the molar mass of the compound.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure, Molecular Formula, and Bond Count**\n\n*   **Structure:** Let's draw the molecule from the formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    ```\n         CH3         CH3             CH3\n          |           |               |\n       H3C-C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C-CH3\n                          |\n                          CH3\n    ```\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=C<) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH<) + 1 (in CH3) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (=C<) + 2 (in (CH3)2) = 12 Carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=CH-) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH<) + 3 (in CH3) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 6 (in (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the main chain. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds (single):**\n        *   Bonds from methyl groups to the chain: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\n        *   Bonds within the main chain: 4\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 5 + 4 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product (C12H22)**\n\nThis is the sum of the energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n`ΔH_atom(product) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C))`\n`ΔH_atom(product) = (22 × 400 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (9 × 200 kJ/mol)`\n`ΔH_atom(product) = 8800 + 600 + 1800`\n`ΔH_atom(product) = 11200 kJ/mol`\n*(Note: This value matches option B, which is a common distractor. This is the enthalpy of atomization, not formation.)*\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`\nThe reactants are 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas.\n`ΔH_atom(reactants) = [12 × ΔH_atom(C)] + [11 × BE(H-H)]`\n`ΔH_atom(reactants) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)`\n`ΔH_atom(reactants) = 12000 + 1100`\n`ΔH_atom(reactants) = 13100 kJ`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol**\n\n`ΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]`\n`ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol`\n`ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol`\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Options and Convert Units if Necessary**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. This value is not present in the options with the correct units (Option A is 1900 kJ/g). We must convert our answer to kJ/g and check again.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:**\n    *   `ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)`\n    *   `ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166`\n    *   `ΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g`\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated value of **11.44 kJ/g** matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the atoms and bonds. The chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: A carbon atom double-bonded to the next carbon, and also single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups. This part has 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens.\n*   **=CH-**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen, participating in the double bond and a single bond. This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   **-CH2-**: A carbon atom with two hydrogens, connected by single bonds. This part has 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen and one methyl (CH3) group, connected by single bonds. This part has 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH2-**: Another methylene group with 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH=**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen, connected by a single bond and a double bond. This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: A carbon atom participating in a double bond and connected to two methyl groups. This part has 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   **Total Carbon (C) atoms**: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H) atoms**: 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, let's count the bonds in the molecule C12H22:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly indicates two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can find the number of C-C single bonds using the total number of bonds in an acyclic molecule, which is (Total Atoms - 1).\n    *   Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34\n    *   Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C=C bonds) - (Number of C-H bonds)\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 2 - 22 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds.\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 bonds * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 bonds * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 bonds * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard state (C(graphite) and H2(g)).\n*   For Carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   For Hydrogen: The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, which is for the reaction H2 -> 2H. The enthalpy of atomization for one mole of H atoms is half of this value (50 kJ/mol).\n    *   22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n*   ΔHf = Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) - Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound)\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert the Answer to the Correct Units**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g and kJ/mol. Our calculated answer is 1900 kJ/mol, which is not an exact option. Let's convert it to kJ/g.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.008) ≈ 166.36 g/mol. For this problem, we can approximate using integer masses: 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\n*   ΔHf in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reasoning and calculations are consistent and have been verified by the code execution.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n2.  **Bond Count:** 9 C-C bonds, 2 C=C bonds, 22 C-H bonds.\n3.  **Enthalpy of Atomization of Compound:**\n    (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n4.  **Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms:**\n    (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ.\n5.  **Enthalpy of Formation of Compound (kJ/mol):**\n    13100 - 11200 = 1900 kJ/mol.\n6.  **Molar Mass:**\n    (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 166 g/mol.\n7.  **Enthalpy of Formation of Compound (kJ/g):**\n    1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nThe calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the feedback and a re-evaluation of the problem, my calculation is correct, and the confusion arose from the feedback process.

This gives a total of 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `C=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The total number of connections between the 12 carbon atoms in a non-cyclic molecule is 11 (n-1). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThe formation of C12H22 from its elements in their standard state is represented by the equation:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to convert them into gaseous atoms:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of solid carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule, which is the sum of all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal sum of bond energies in the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants and the sum of the bond energies of the product.\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 5: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options are given in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. For this, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is:\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon Atoms (C):** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Covalent Bonds**\n\nNext, we count each type of covalent bond in one molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms, plus one for each double or triple bond. A simpler method is to count them directly from the structure. For a molecule with 12 carbons and 2 double bonds, there are a total of 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\n**Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound)** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas).\n\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into two moles of H atoms. We need 22 moles of H atoms.\n    *   Energy = 11 mol (of H2) * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n**Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements)** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy of atomization of the elements minus the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements) - (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g and kJ/mol. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check against the options.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 * 12.01 g/mol) + (22 * 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.34 g/mol. For this problem, we can approximate with integer masses: 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy in kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms from the chemical formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: 3 Carbon atoms, 6 Hydrogen atoms\n*   **=CH-**: 1 Carbon atom, 1 Hydrogen atom\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 Carbon atom, 2 Hydrogen atoms\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: 2 Carbon atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 Carbon atom, 2 Hydrogen atoms\n*   **-CH=**: 1 Carbon atom, 1 Hydrogen atom\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: 3 Carbon atoms, 6 Hydrogen atoms\n\nAdding these up:\n*   **Total Carbon (C) atoms**: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H) atoms**: 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNext, we need to count the number of C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds by examining the structure.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The total number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure contains two double bonds (=), so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can count the single bonds between carbon atoms:\n    *   Two C-C bonds in (CH3)2C=\n    *   One C-C bond between =CH- and -CH2-\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-\n    *   One C-C bond within -CH(CH3)-\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH2- and -CH=\n    *   Two C-C bonds in =C(CH3)2\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization = 8800 + 600 + 1800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard state (12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g)).\n\n*   Energy for Carbon = 12 * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ/mol\n*   Energy for Hydrogen = 11 * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6.

Molecular Structure and Bond Counting**\n\nThe chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure to count the atoms and bonds accurately:\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 22\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two `C=C` double bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** By drawing the structure and counting the single bonds between carbon atoms (both in the main chain and in the methyl branches), we find there are 9 C-C single bonds.\n\n**Bond Tally:**\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"enthalpy of formation\". However, based on the provided multiple-choice options, it is highly likely that the question is asking for the **enthalpy of atomization** of the compound. The enthalpy of atomization is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of a compound to form individual gaseous atoms. Let's calculate this value.\n\n**Enthalpy of Atomization (ΔH_atom) of the compound:**\nThis is the sum of the energies of all the bonds in the molecule.\n\nΔH_atom = (Number of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (Number of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (Number of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atom = 8800 + 1800 + 600\nΔH_atom = 11200 kJ/mol\n\nThis calculated value for the enthalpy of atomization matches option B exactly.\n\nFor completeness, the actual enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) would be calculated as follows:\n*   **Enthalpy of atomization of reactants:** This is the energy needed to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard state (11 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g)).\n    ΔH_atom(reactants) = (11 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n    ΔH_atom(reactants) = (11 × 1000) + (11 × 100) = 11000 + 1100 = 12100 kJ\n*   **Enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f):**\n    ΔH_f = ΔH_atom(reactants) - ΔH_atom(compound)\n    ΔH_f = 12100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 900 kJ/mol\n\nSince 900 kJ/mol is not an option and 11200 kJ/mol is, it is clear that the question intended to ask for the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpies of atomization. The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the compound into its constituent atoms and the energy required to form those atoms from their elements in their standard states.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** By counting the atoms, we find there are 12 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms. The formula is C12H22.\n*   **Molar Mass:** The approximate molar mass is (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Bond Analysis:** We need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** There are 9 C-C single bonds.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** There are 2 C=C double bonds.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds. This is calculated by summing the bond energies of all the bonds in one mole of the substance.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 mol × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 mol × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 mol × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) into gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g).\n\n*   Energy to atomize Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize Hydrogen = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol (for H-H bond) = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound's bonds are formed (which is the negative of the compound's enthalpy of atomization). The formula is:\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options provided are in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass (166 g/mol).\n\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n**2. List Careful Points:**\n*   **Correctly interpret the chemical structure:** The condensed formula must be translated into a full structural formula to accurately count the bonds.\n*   **Determine the molecular formula:** Count the total number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to find the molecular formula (CxHy).\n*   **Accurately count all bonds:** Systematically count the number of C-H, C-C (single), and C=C (double) bonds in the molecule. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Understand the definition of enthalpy of formation:** The enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n    `x C(s, graphite) + (y/2) H2(g) → CxHy(g)`\n*   **Apply Hess's Law:** The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the given bond energies and enthalpy of atomization data via a thermodynamic cycle (Hess's Law). The formula is:\n    `ΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]`\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the product:** This is the sum of all the bond energies in one mole of the product molecule.\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants:** This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states to gaseous atoms. For `x C(s)` and `(y/2) H2(g)`, this is `[x * ΔH_atom(C)] + [(y/2) * BE(H-H)]`.\n*   **Check the units:** The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. The initial calculation will yield a result in kJ/mol. If this doesn't match an option, it must be converted to kJ/g by dividing by the molar mass of the compound.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure, Molecular Formula, and Bond Count**\n\n*   **Structure:** Let's draw the molecule from the formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    ```\n         CH3         CH3             CH3\n          |           |               |\n       H3C-C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C-CH3\n                          |\n                          CH3\n    ```\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=C<) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH<) + 1 (in CH3) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (=C<) + 2 (in (CH3)2) = 12 Carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=CH-) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH<) + 3 (in CH3) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 6 (in (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the main chain.

Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the atoms and bonds. The chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: A carbon atom double-bonded to the next carbon, and also single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups. This part has 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens.\n*   **=CH-**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen, participating in the double bond and a single bond. This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   **-CH2-**: A carbon atom with two hydrogens, connected by single bonds. This part has 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen and one methyl (CH3) group, connected by single bonds. This part has 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH2-**: Another methylene group with 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   **-CH=**: A carbon atom with one hydrogen, connected by a single bond and a double bond. This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: A carbon atom participating in a double bond and connected to two methyl groups. This part has 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   **Total Carbon (C) atoms**: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H) atoms**: 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNow, let's count the bonds in the molecule C12H22:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly indicates two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can find the number of C-C single bonds using the total number of bonds in an acyclic molecule, which is (Total Atoms - 1).\n    *   Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34\n    *   Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C=C bonds) - (Number of C-H bonds)\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 2 - 22 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds.\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 bonds * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 bonds * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 bonds * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard state (C(graphite) and H2(g)).\n*   For Carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   For Hydrogen: The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, which is for the reaction H2 -> 2H. The enthalpy of atomization for one mole of H atoms is half of this value (50 kJ/mol).\n    *   22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n*   ΔHf = Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) - Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound)\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6.

For this problem, we can approximate using integer masses: 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\n*   ΔHf in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe reasoning and calculations are consistent and have been verified by the code execution.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n2.  **Bond Count:** 9 C-C bonds, 2 C=C bonds, 22 C-H bonds.\n3.  **Enthalpy of Atomization of Compound:**\n    (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n4.  **Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms:**\n    (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ.\n5.  **Enthalpy of Formation of Compound (kJ/mol):**\n    13100 - 11200 = 1900 kJ/mol.\n6.  **Molar Mass:**\n    (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 166 g/mol.\n7.  **Enthalpy of Formation of Compound (kJ/g):**\n    1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nThe calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the feedback and a re-evaluation of the problem, my calculation is correct, and the confusion arose from the feedback process.

The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the bonds of the elemental reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds of the product molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Types\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (at C=) + 1 (at =CH) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 2 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 1 (at =CH) + 3 (in =C(CH3)2). This gives a total of 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (in =CH) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 4 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in =CH) + 6 (in =C(CH3)2). This gives a total of 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `C=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The total number of connections between the 12 carbon atoms in a non-cyclic molecule is 11 (n-1). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThe formation of C12H22 from its elements in their standard state is represented by the equation:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to convert them into gaseous atoms:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of solid carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule, which is the sum of all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal sum of bond energies in the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants and the sum of the bond energies of the product.\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 5: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options are given in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. For this, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is:\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon Atoms (C):** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Covalent Bonds**\n\nNext, we count each type of covalent bond in one molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms, plus one for each double or triple bond. A simpler method is to count them directly from the structure. For a molecule with 12 carbons and 2 double bonds, there are a total of 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n\n**Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound)** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4.

This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into two moles of H atoms. We need 22 moles of H atoms.\n    *   Energy = 11 mol (of H2) * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n**Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements)** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy of atomization of the elements minus the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements) - (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6.
