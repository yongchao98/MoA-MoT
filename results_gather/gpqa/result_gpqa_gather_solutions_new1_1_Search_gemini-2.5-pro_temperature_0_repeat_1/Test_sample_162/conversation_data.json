  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nWe would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?\n\nA) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3\nB) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3\nC) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3\nD) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe Python script systematically evaluated each multiple-choice option as a hypothesis. The core constraint was that the total moles of H⁺ supplied by the acid must equal the sum of the moles needed for the stoichiometric reaction with Fe(OH)₃ and the moles needed to remain in solution to create the final pH.\n\n*   **Hypotheses A and B** were immediately eliminated because the volume of acid they proposed was insufficient to even dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃, violating the problem's primary condition.\n*   **Hypothesis D** was eliminated because the amount of acid supplied (3.214 x 10⁻³ mol) was significantly different from the calculated required amount (2.876 x 10⁻³ mol), resulting in a large discrepancy of 11.74%.\n*   **Hypothesis C** was found to be highly consistent. The moles of acid supplied (3.009 x 10⁻³ mol) almost perfectly matched the calculated required moles (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol), with a negligible discrepancy of only 0.08%.\n\nTherefore, the script concluded that option C is the only chemically consistent answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n*   O: 15.999 g/mol × 3 = 47.997 g/mol\n*   H: 1.008 g/mol × 3 = 3.024 g/mol\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.845 + 47.997 + 3.024 = **106.866 g/mol**\n\nNext, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = **0.00093575 mol**\n\n### Step 2: Determine the volume of strong acid needed\n\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide by a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or HNO₃, represented by H⁺) follows this reaction:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ needed:** 3 × 0.00093575 mol = **0.00280725 mol**\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid that contains this amount of H⁺:\n*   **Volume of acid:** Moles / Concentration = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L\n*   Converting to cm³: 0.0280725 L × 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis volume is very close to the 28.05 cm³ listed in option B.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter dissolution, the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution contains the Fe³⁺ ions produced. These ions hydrolyze in water, acting as a weak acid and lowering the pH. The primary hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n**[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)**\n\nFor simplicity, this is often written as:\n\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)**\n\nTo find the pH, we need:\n1.  The initial concentration of Fe³⁺.\n2.  The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction.\n\n**1. Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n*   **[Fe³⁺]:** Moles / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L = **0.0093575 M**\n\n**2. Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka):**\nThe pKa for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion is approximately 2.2.\n*   **pKa ≈ 2.2**\n*   **Ka = 10⁻²·² ≈ 6.31 × 10⁻³**\n\nNow, we set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the hydrolysis:\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| **Fe³⁺**     | 0.0093575   | -x         | 0.0093575 - x   |\n| **Fe(OH)²⁺** | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| **H⁺**       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n6.31 × 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.0093575 - x)\n\nBecause Ka is relatively large compared to the initial concentration, we cannot use the approximation that 'x' is negligible. We must solve the full quadratic equation:\nx² = (6.31 × 10⁻³)(0.0093575 - x)\nx² = 5.904 × 10⁻⁵ - (6.31 × 10⁻³)x\n**x² + (6.31 × 10⁻³)x - 5.904 × 10⁻⁵ = 0**\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\nx = [-(6.31 × 10⁻³) ± √((6.31 × 10⁻³)² - 4(1)(-5.904 × 10⁻⁵))] / 2(1)\nx = [-0.00631 ± √(3.98 × 10⁻⁵ + 2.36 × 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.00631 ± √(2.758 × 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.00631 ± 0.0166] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\nx = (-0.00631 + 0.0166) / 2\nx = 0.01029 / 2\n**x = 0.005145 M**\n\nThis value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n\nFinally, calculate the pH:\n*   **pH:** -log₁₀[H⁺] = -log₁₀(0.005145) ≈ **2.29**\n\nThe calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm³) and the pH (2.29) are closest to the values in option B (28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04). The discrepancy in pH may arise from using a slightly different pKa value or considering further hydrolysis steps, but it is significantly closer to 2.04 than to the other options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the minimum volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we need to add a strong acid. The acid provides H⁺ ions that react with the OH⁻ ions from the Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction. This reduces the OH⁻ concentration in the solution. According to Le Châtelier's principle, the equilibrium for the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ will shift to the right, causing more of it to dissolve.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe dissolution equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nThis equilibrium is governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp:\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nFor all the Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be, at a minimum, equal to the Ksp. Literature values for the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C vary, but a commonly cited range is between 10⁻³⁹ and 10⁻³⁶.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we find the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles.\n\n**3. Calculate the Concentration of Fe³⁺**\n\nWhen the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution, the concentration of Fe³⁺ will be:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009357 moles / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M.\n\n**4. Determine the Required pH**\n\nWe can now work backward from the provided options. Let's test the values from option D.\n*   If the final pH of the solution is 2.69.\n\nFrom this pH, we can find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n*   pOH = 14 - pH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.³¹ M ≈ 4.898 x 10⁻¹² M\n\nLet's check if this pH is sufficient by calculating the corresponding Ksp value.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.009357) * (4.898 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶\nThis value is within the accepted range for Ksp, indicating that a pH of 2.69 is a plausible condition for dissolving the specified amount of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Amount of Acid Needed**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid (H⁺) required has two components:\n*   **Part A: Acid to react with Fe(OH)₃.**\n    Based on the stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 * 0.0009357 moles = 0.002807 moles.\n\n*   **Part B: Acid to maintain the final pH.**\n    This is the excess H⁺ that remains in the solution to keep it acidic at pH 2.69.\n    [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    Moles H⁺ (solution) = [H⁺] * Volume = 0.002042 M * 0.1 L = 0.0002042 moles.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺** = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (solution)\n    Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = 0.0030112 moles.\n\n**6. Calculate the Volume of the Acid**\n\nThe problem specifies a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid.\n*   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n\nConverting this volume to cm³:\n*   Volume = 0.030112 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 30.11 cm³.\n\nThese calculated values (pH 2.69; 30.11 cm³) are an excellent match for option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps involving stoichiometry and equilibrium principles.\n\n**1. Reaction and Stoichiometry**\n\nFirst, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid (represented by H+):\n\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions.\n\n**2. Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.867 g/mol.\n\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.867 g/mol = 9.357 x 10^-4 mol\n\n**3. Concentration of Fe3+**\n\nThis amount of Fe(OH)3 dissolves in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The concentration of the resulting Fe3+ ions will be:\n\n*   [Fe3+] = 9.357 x 10^-4 mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10^-3 M\n\n**4. Equilibrium and pH Calculation**\n\nFor the Fe(OH)3 to remain dissolved, the ion product [Fe3+][OH-]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 at 25°C is approximately 2.8 x 10^-39. We use this to find the maximum hydroxide concentration [OH-] allowed in the solution.\n\n*   Ksp = [Fe3+][OH-]³\n*   2.8 x 10^-39 = (9.357 x 10^-3) * [OH-]³\n*   [OH-]³ = (2.8 x 10^-39) / (9.357 x 10^-3) = 2.992 x 10^-37\n*   [OH-] = (2.992 x 10^-37)^(1/3) = 6.688 x 10^-13 M\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of H+ and the pH of the solution using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C).\n\n*   [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1.0 x 10^-14 / 6.688 x 10^-13 M = 0.01495 M\n*   pH = -log[H+] = -log(0.01495) = 2.825\n\nThis pH value is very close to 2.83. Let's re-evaluate with a slightly different Ksp value of 1.6 x 10^-39, which is also commonly cited.\n\n*   [OH-]³ = (1.6 x 10^-39) / (9.357 x 10^-3) = 1.710 x 10^-37\n*   [OH-] = (1.710 x 10^-37)^(1/3) = 5.55 x 10^-13 M\n*   [H+] = 1.0 x 10^-14 / 5.55 x 10^-13 M = 0.0180 M\n*   pH = -log(0.0180) = 2.74\n\nGiven the options, a pH of 2.83 is the most plausible target. Let's proceed with the pH of 2.83, which corresponds to an [H+] of 10^-2.83 = 1.479 x 10^-2 M.\n\n**5. Volume of Acid Required**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid added must do two things:\n*   Neutralize the Fe(OH)3.\n*   Provide the excess H+ ions to maintain the final pH.\n\n*   **Moles of H+ to neutralize Fe(OH)3:**\n    *   From stoichiometry, this is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.\n    *   Moles H+ (reaction) = 3 * 9.357 x 10^-4 mol = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ remaining in solution:**\n    *   This is the amount needed to create the acidic pH in the 100 cm³ solution.\n    *   Moles H+ (excess) = [H+]_final * Volume = (1.479 x 10^-2 M) * 0.1 L = 1.479 x 10^-3 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H+ needed:**\n    *   Total moles = Moles H+ (reaction) + Moles H+ (excess)\n    *   Total moles = 2.807 x 10^-3 + 1.479 x 10^-3 = 4.286 x 10^-3 mol\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this total number of moles.\n\n*   Volume = Total moles / Molarity = 4.286 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04286 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.04286 L * 1000 cm³/L = 42.86 cm³\n\nLet's re-examine the options. None of the options match this calculation. Let's re-calculate using the pH of 2.04 from option D.\n\n*   If pH = 2.04, then [H+] = 10^-2.04 = 0.00912 M.\n*   Moles H+ (excess) = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 9.12 x 10^-4 mol.\n*   Total moles H+ = (2.807 x 10^-3) + (9.12 x 10^-4) = 3.719 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   Volume of acid = 3.719 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³. This is not 28.05 cm³.\n\nLet's try working backwards from the volume in option D, 28.05 cm³.\n\n*   Moles of H+ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   From our calculation, the moles of H+ needed just to react with the Fe(OH)3 is 2.807 x 10^-3 mol.\n\nThese two values are almost identical. The slight difference is likely due to rounding of the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let's assume the moles of H+ added are entirely consumed by the reaction.\n\n*   Moles of H+ added = Moles of H+ reacted = 2.805 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   This implies that there are virtually no excess H+ ions left, which cannot be correct as the solution must be acidic to keep the Fe(OH)3 dissolved.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options. However, let's reconsider the initial stoichiometric calculation. The amount of acid required *just for the neutralization reaction* is:\n\n*   Moles H+ (reaction) = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol\n*   Volume of acid = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³\n\nThis volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option D. This suggests that the question assumes the amount of acid needed to lower the pH is negligible compared to the amount needed for the neutralization. If we accept this premise:\n\n*   The required volume is approximately 28.05 cm³.\n*   We must then determine the pH. After the neutralization, we have a solution of Fe3+ ions. Fe3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water:\n    Fe3+(aq) + 2H2O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)2+(aq) + H3O+(aq)\n*   To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe3+(aq). The Ka for Fe3+(aq) is approximately 6.3 x 10^-3.\n*   The concentration of Fe3+ is 9.357 x 10^-3 M.\n*   Ka = [Fe(OH)2+][H3O+] / [Fe3+] = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n*   6.3 x 10^-3 = x² / 0.009357\n*   x² = 5.895 x 10^-5\n*   x = [H3O+] = 7.68 x 10^-3 M\n*   pH = -log(7.68 x 10^-3) = 2.11\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.11 is very close to the pH of 2.04 provided in option D. The small discrepancies arise from using slightly different values for constants (molar mass, Ksp, Ka). Based on this analysis, option D is the most chemically consistent answer, assuming the volume is primarily for neutralization and the pH results from the hydrolysis of the Fe3+ product.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Volume: 28.05 cm³ is the stoichiometric amount for neutralization.\n*   pH: 2.04 is a reasonable pH for a ~0.009 M solution of Fe3+(aq).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main goal is to dissolve 0.1 g of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a final solution volume of 100 cm³. To do this, we need to add a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of this acid required and the pH of the final solution.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Constants**\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   Total final volume of solution = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   Concentration of strong acid (e.g., HCl) = 0.1 M\n*   Temperature = 25°C\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:\n    *   Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n    *   O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol\n\n**3. The Chemical Reaction**\nIron(III) hydroxide is a base and is very insoluble in water. It dissolves in acid by reacting with H⁺ ions. The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**4. Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Point 1: Stoichiometry.** The reaction shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n*   **Point 2: Excess Acid.** To ensure the solid dissolves completely and stays dissolved, a certain concentration of H⁺ must be present at equilibrium. This often means a slight excess of acid beyond the stoichiometric amount is needed.\n*   **Point 3: Hydrolysis.** The product of the reaction, the Fe³⁺ ion, is the conjugate acid of a weak base (Fe(OH)²⁺). In water, it hydrolyzes to produce H⁺ ions, which will lower the pH of the solution. The reaction is: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq).\n*   **Point 4: Multiple Choice Strategy.** Since this is a multiple-choice question, we can test the given options to see which one is self-consistent. A common simplification in such problems is to ignore the effect of hydrolysis. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation (Testing the Options)**\n\nLet's test the provided options by calculating the pH that would result from the given volume of acid, assuming the contribution from Fe³⁺ hydrolysis is negligible, and see if it matches the given pH.\n\n**Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**Calculate the moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction (stoichiometric amount):**\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × 9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol\n\nNow, let's check **Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added:**\n    *   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (added) = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = 3.009 × 10⁻³ mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ remaining after the reaction:**\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = Moles H⁺ (added) - Moles H⁺ (consumed)\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = 3.009 × 10⁻³ mol - 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol = 0.202 × 10⁻³ mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess H⁺ in the final solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n    *   [H⁺] from excess acid = Moles of H⁺ (excess) / Total Volume\n    *   [H⁺] = (0.202 × 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 L = 2.02 × 10⁻³ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH from this excess H⁺ concentration (ignoring hydrolysis):**\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺])\n    *   pH = -log₁₀(2.02 × 10⁻³) ≈ 2.695\n\n5.  **Compare:** The calculated pH (2.695) is a very close match to the pH given in Option C (2.69).\n\nLet's briefly check another option to confirm our method.\n**Check Option B: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   Volume of acid = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L\n*   Moles of H⁺ (added) = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 2.805 × 10⁻³ mol\n*   This is almost exactly the stoichiometric amount (2.807 × 10⁻³ mol). There is virtually no excess strong acid. The pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. A detailed calculation shows the pH would be around 2.3-2.6 (depending on the Ka value used), not 2.04. Therefore, Option B is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe values in Option C are arithmetically consistent if one makes the simplifying (though chemically inaccurate) assumption that the pH is determined solely by the excess strong acid and that the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ can be ignored. This is the most plausible intended solution for this problem.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a total volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution at 25°C.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Molar Concentration of Fe³⁺\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nThis amount is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n*   [Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n### Step 2: Determine the pH of the Solution\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ is governed by its solubility product, Ksp.\n*   Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be completely dissolved, the ion product must be equal to the Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.8 x 10⁻³⁹.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   2.8 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n\nNow, we solve for the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (2.8 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.993 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (2.993 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.688 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nFrom the [OH⁻], we can calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.688 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.17\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.17 = 1.83\n\nThis pH is the pH of the final solution. Looking at the options, pH 2.04 is the closest value. Let's re-evaluate using a different Ksp value, as it can vary between sources. Using Ksp = 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹:\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (1.6 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 1.710 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (1.710 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.55 x 10⁻¹³ M\n*   pOH = -log₁₀(5.55 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.26\n*   pH = 14 - 12.26 = 1.74\n\nLet's try the pH from option D, pH = 2.04, to see if it works out.\n*   If pH = 2.04, then pOH = 14 - 2.04 = 11.96\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶ ≈ 1.10 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³) * (1.10 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.24 x 10⁻⁴⁷. This is far from published values.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy. Let's reconsider the problem, accounting for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\nThe Ka for this reaction is about 6.3 x 10⁻³. The problem asks for the minimum acid to dissolve the precipitate, which is dictated by the Ksp equilibrium. The slight variations in Ksp values can lead to different pH results. Let's proceed with the pH of 2.04 from option D and calculate the required acid volume.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Volume of Acid Needed\n\nThe overall reaction with the strong acid (H⁺) is:\n*   Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions added must accomplish two things:\n1.  React with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Establish the final acidic pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Moles of H⁺ to react with Fe(OH)₃:**\n*   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * (moles of Fe(OH)₃) = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**2. Moles of H⁺ remaining to create the final pH:**\n*   Final pH = 2.04\n*   [H⁺] (final) = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] (final) * Total Volume = (9.12 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.1 L) = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**Total moles of H⁺ required:**\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**Volume of 0.1 M strong acid:**\n*   Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n*   Volume = (3.719 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.03719 L * 1000 cm³/L = 37.19 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option D (28.05 cm³). Let's re-examine the calculation.\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.69 and volume of 30.09 cm³ from option C is correct and work backward.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.04 x 10⁻³ M. Moles = (2.04 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ added:** Volume * Molarity = 0.03009 L * 0.1 M = 3.009 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ reacted:** Total Moles - Moles remaining = (3.009 x 10⁻³) - (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 2.805 x 10⁻³ mol.\nThis value (2.805 x 10⁻³ mol) is extremely close to the stoichiometric amount required to react with the Fe(OH)₃ we calculated earlier (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol). The minor difference is likely due to rounding during the steps.\n\nTherefore, the calculations for option C are consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nFinal check of the pH for option C:\n*   pH = 2.69\n*   pOH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.³¹ ≈ 4.9 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³) * (4.9 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻⁴⁵. This Ksp is still inconsistent with published values.\n\nHowever, among the given choices, option C is the only one where the provided volume of acid corresponds almost perfectly to the amount needed to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given pH. The discrepancy in the Ksp value might stem from using simplified assumptions and not accounting for activity coefficients or the formation of various iron-hydroxy complexes in the solution. Given the multiple-choice format, the most chemically consistent answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe analysis is correct. The provided code output confirms the reasoning.\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Calculation**: The minimum volume of acid required just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ is calculated to be ~28.07 cm³. This eliminates options B and D, as they provide less acid than is stoichiometrically necessary.\n\n2.  **Charge Balance Verification**: The final solution must be electrically neutral. The principle of charge balance (3[Fe³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [A⁻]) is used to check the consistency of the remaining options.\n\n3.  **Code Output Interpretation**:\n    *   For **Option A**, a pH of 2.69 requires a calculated acid volume of 30.11 cm³. This is an excellent match for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n    *   For **Option C**, a pH of 3.16 requires a calculated acid volume of 28.76 cm³. This is a significant mismatch with the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\nThe only option that is physically and chemically consistent is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options provide pairs of pH and volume values. The correct option must be self-consistent.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 corresponding to 0.1 g.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is calculated as:\n    Molar Mass(Fe) + 3 * (Molar Mass(O) + Molar Mass(H))\n    = 55.845 g/mol + 3 * (15.999 g/mol + 1.008 g/mol)\n    = 55.845 + 3 * (17.007) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass\n    = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the chemical reaction and acid requirement**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of acid (H⁺) added serves two purposes:\n1.  **Reaction:** To react stoichiometrically with all the Fe(OH)3.\n2.  **Final pH:** To remain in the solution as excess H⁺, which determines the final pH.\n\nTotal moles of H⁺ added = (Moles of H⁺ for reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution)\n\n**Step 3: Test the given options for consistency**\n\nWe will test each option by using the given pH to calculate the required volume of acid and comparing it to the volume given in that option.\n\nLet's test **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ for the reaction:**\n    From the stoichiometry (1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺):\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 * Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution:**\n    The final pH is 2.69. The concentration of H⁺ is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ.\n    [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M\n    The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] * Volume = (2.042 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required:**\n    Volume = Total Moles / Molarity\n    Volume = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03011 L\n\n*   **Convert volume to cm³ and compare:**\n    Volume = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in Option B (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is due to rounding of constants. This indicates that Option B is the correct, self-consistent answer.\n\nThe provided code execution confirms this calculation:\n`Calculated acid volume for pH 2.69: 30.11 cm3`\n`Given acid volume in option B: 30.09 cm3`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe consistency check shows that only Option A has a calculated acid volume that matches the volume given in the option.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** 0.000936 mol.\n*   **Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for reaction:** 3 * 0.000936 mol = 0.002808 mol.\n*   **Check Option A:**\n    *   Given pH = 2.69. This means final [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.00204 M.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ needed to achieve this pH in 0.1 L: 0.00204 M * 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ needed:** 0.002808 mol (for reaction) + 0.000204 mol (for pH) = 0.003012 mol.\n    *   **Volume of 0.1 M acid needed:** 0.003012 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03012 L = 30.12 cm³.\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume of 30.12 cm³ is extremely close to the 30.09 cm³ given in Option A. The other options were shown to be inconsistent. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo solve this problem, we will perform a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the final pH of the solution.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.**\n    First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃. The molar mass is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n2.  **Write the reaction for dissolution in acid.**\n    Iron(III) hydroxide is a basic salt that reacts with a strong acid (represented by H⁺) in a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction.**\n    From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n4.  **Determine the final concentration of Fe³⁺.**\n    The 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Volume\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the equilibrium H⁺ concentration needed to keep Fe(OH)₃ dissolved.**\n    For the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. We will calculate the condition at the limit, where the solution is saturated. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.0 x 10⁻³⁹ mol⁴dm⁻¹².\n    *   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    *   2.0 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n    *   [OH⁻]³ = (2.0 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.139 x 10⁻³⁷\n    *   [OH⁻] = (2.139 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.98 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\n    Now, we use the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C) to find the required hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].\n    *   [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (5.98 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 0.0167 M\n\n6.  **Calculate the final pH of the solution.**\n    *   pH = -log[H⁺]\n    *   pH = -log(0.0167) ≈ 2.78\n\n7.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required.**\n    The total amount of acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacts with Fe(OH)₃ and the acid that remains in the solution to maintain the pH.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] * Total Volume\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = 0.0167 M * 0.1 L = 1.67 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = Moles of H⁺ (reacted) + Moles of H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol + 1.67 x 10⁻³ mol = 4.477 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n8.  **Calculate the minimum volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.**\n    *   Volume = Total moles of H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n    *   Volume = 4.477 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04477 L\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.04477 L * 1000 cm³/L = 44.77 cm³\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated pH is approximately 2.78, and the required volume of the strong acid is 44.77 cm³. Comparing these results to the given options:\n\n*   A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the calculated values. However, option D has a pH of 2.69, which is the closest to our calculated pH of 2.78. The discrepancy in volume may arise from using slightly different values for the molar mass or Ksp, or from a different interpretation of the problem's conditions. Given the choices, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps involving stoichiometry and equilibrium principles.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\nFirst, we determine the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Atomic Mass of Fe) + 3 * (Atomic Mass of O) + 3 * (Atomic Mass of H)\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.845 + 3*(16.00) + 3*(1.008) = 106.869 g/mol.\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles.\n\n**2. Stoichiometry of the Dissolution Reaction:**\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) proceeds according to the following reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to react with every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\nMoles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\n**3. Determine the Final pH using the Solubility Product (Ksp):**\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved, the ion product of its dissolved ions must be less than or equal to its solubility product constant, Ksp. The equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nThe Ksp expression is Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³.\nThe concentration of Fe³⁺ in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n[Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M.\nThe Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹.\nNow, we can calculate the maximum hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] that can be present before Fe(OH)₃ precipitates:\n1.6 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n[OH⁻]³ = (1.6 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 1.710 x 10⁻³⁷ M³\n[OH⁻] = (1.710 x 10⁻³⁷)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 5.55 x 10⁻¹³ M.\nNow we can find the pOH and then the pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(5.55 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.26\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.26 = 1.74.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Acid Needed:**\nThe total amount of strong acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacted with the Fe(OH)₃ and the excess acid required to maintain the final pH.\nFirst, find the concentration of H⁺ at the final pH:\n[H⁺]final = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻¹·⁷⁴ ≈ 1.82 x 10⁻² M.\nNext, calculate the moles of excess H⁺ in the 100 cm³ solution:\nMoles of excess H⁺ = [H⁺]final * Volume = (1.82 x 10⁻² mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 1.82 x 10⁻³ moles.\nNow, find the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:\nTotal moles H⁺ = (moles of H⁺ reacted) + (moles of excess H⁺)\nTotal moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles) + (1.82 x 10⁻³ moles) = 4.627 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\n**5. Calculate the Volume of the Acid:**\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed:\nVolume = Total moles H⁺ / Molarity = (4.627 x 10⁻³ moles) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.04627 L.\nConverting this volume to cm³:\nVolume = 0.04627 L * 1000 cm³/L = 46.27 cm³.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on these calculations. None of the options match. There might be a different Ksp value used for the problem's intended answer. Let's re-calculate using the pH from option C (pH = 2.04) to see if the corresponding volume matches.\n\n**Re-calculation assuming pH = 2.04:**\nIf the final pH is 2.04, then:\n[H⁺]final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M.\nMoles of excess H⁺ = (9.12 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ moles.\nTotal moles H⁺ = (moles of H⁺ reacted) + (moles of excess H⁺)\nTotal moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴ moles) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ moles.\nVolume of acid = (3.719 x 10⁻³ moles) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\nThis does not match the volume in option C (28.05 cm³).\n\nLet's try working backward from the volume in option C (28.05 cm³).\nMoles of H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10⁻³ moles.\nThis amount is almost exactly the amount needed just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles). This implies there is virtually no excess acid, which would result in a much higher pH.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options or the standard Ksp values. However, let's re-examine the initial calculation. The pH of 1.74 is closest to 2.04 among the choices. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 / 106.869 = 0.0009357 mol\nMoles H⁺ reacted = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 / 0.1 = 0.009357 M\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.04 from option C is correct and check the Ksp value that would result.\nIf pH = 2.04, pOH = 11.96.\n[OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶ ≈ 1.10 x 10⁻¹² M.\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.009357) * (1.10 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.24 x 10⁻⁴⁴. This is a plausible, though different, value for Ksp.\n\nNow let's calculate the volume of acid required for a pH of 2.04.\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ * 0.1 = 0.000912 mol.\nTotal moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\nVolume acid = 0.003719 / 0.1 = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option C (28.05 cm³). Let's re-calculate using the volume from option C and find the resulting pH.\nMoles H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\nMoles H⁺ reacted = 0.002807 mol.\nThis is a slight deficit of H⁺, meaning not all the Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the mass of Fe(OH)₃ and work backwards from option C.\nAssume pH = 2.04 and Volume = 28.05 cm³ are correct.\nTotal moles H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\nMoles H⁺ reacted = Total moles - excess moles = 0.002805 - 0.000912 = 0.001893 mol.\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = Moles H⁺ reacted / 3 = 0.001893 / 3 = 0.000631 mol.\nMass Fe(OH)₃ = 0.000631 mol * 106.869 g/mol = 0.0674 g.\nIf the initial mass was 0.0674 g instead of 0.1 g, option C would be correct.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, let's reconsider the problem as stated. It's possible a different Ksp value is intended. A common literature value for Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ is around 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\nUsing Ksp = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹:\n[OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (0.009357) ≈ 2.98 x 10⁻³⁷\n[OH⁻] ≈ 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M\npOH = -log(6.68 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.18\npH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82\nThis pH is still closest to 2.04. The associated volume would be:\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻¹·⁸² * 0.1 = 0.00151 mol\nTotal moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.00151 = 0.004317 mol\nVolume = 0.004317 / 0.1 = 0.04317 L = 43.17 cm³\n\nGiven the provided options, there is a high probability of an error in the question's data. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" fit, the calculated pH values (1.74-1.82) are in the same range as the pH in option C (2.04), while the other options are further away. The calculated volumes do not align with any option. Let's assume the intended answer is C, likely due to the use of specific, non-standard textbook values or a typo in the problem statement.\n\nFinal check of logic: The process of calculating moles of reactant, determining the required final pH for dissolution via Ksp, calculating the excess acid needed for that pH, and summing the reacted and excess acid to find the total volume is chemically sound. The discrepancy arises from the numerical values provided in the options not matching the results of these sound calculations with standard chemical data. Based on the closest pH value, C is the most plausible intended answer despite the volume mismatch.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the minimum volume of acid needed and the resulting pH.\n\n**1. Molar Mass and Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n*   O: 15.999 g/mol\n*   H: 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNext, we find the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n\n**2. Dissolution Reaction and Stoichiometry**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) proceeds as follows:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions. Therefore, the moles of H⁺ required to react with the Fe(OH)₃ are:\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.0028071 mol\n\n**3. Equilibrium pH for Dissolution**\n\nTo ensure all the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\nNow, we can find the maximum hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] allowed at equilibrium for the iron(III) hydroxide to remain dissolved:\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (0.009357) * [OH⁻]³\n*   [OH⁻]³ = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ / 0.009357 = 2.982 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (2.982 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nWith the hydroxide concentration, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH of the resulting solution:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.68 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.18\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82\n\nThis pH is the pH of the final solution. Looking at the options, pH 2.04 is the closest. Let's re-evaluate using a slightly different Ksp value, as it can vary between sources. For instance, a Ksp of 6 x 10⁻³⁸ gives a pH of 2.27. A Ksp of 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹ gives a pH of 1.77. Let's proceed with the calculation using the pH from option D (2.04) to see if the volume matches.\n\n**4. Total Acid Required**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacts with the Fe(OH)₃ and the acid that remains in the solution to maintain the final pH.\n\nLet's assume the final pH is 2.04. The concentration of free H⁺ ions is:\n*   [H⁺] (free) = 10⁻²⁰⁴ ≈ 0.00912 M\n\nThe moles of free H⁺ in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution are:\n*   Moles of H⁺ (free) = Concentration * Volume = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ = Moles of H⁺ (reacted) + Moles of H⁺ (free)\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ = 0.0028071 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.0037191 mol\n\n**5. Volume of the Strong Acid**\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to provide this total amount of H⁺:\n*   Volume = Total Moles / Molarity = 0.0037191 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.037191 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.037191 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 37.19 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) is not a close match to the 28.05 cm³ in option D. Let's re-calculate using the values from option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³).\n\n*   [H⁺] (free) = 10⁻²⁶⁹ ≈ 0.00204 M\n*   Moles of H⁺ (free) = 0.00204 M * 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ = 0.0028071 mol + 0.000204 mol = 0.0030111 mol\n*   Volume = 0.0030111 mol / 0.1 M = 0.030111 L ≈ 30.11 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the volume in option C (30.09 cm³). The slight difference can be attributed to rounding during intermediate steps or a slightly different molar mass or Ksp value used in the problem's source. The pH of 2.69 corresponds to a Ksp value in the range of 10⁻³⁶, which is also a cited value.\n\nTherefore, the combination of pH 2.69 and a required volume of approximately 30.09 cm³ is the most consistent and correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the chemical reaction that occurs. Ferric hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a sparingly soluble base that reacts with a strong acid (let's denote it as HA, which provides H⁺ ions) in a neutralization reaction. The reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nTo calculate the minimum volume of the acid required, we need to find the stoichiometric amount of H⁺ ions needed to react completely with 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃. This requires the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n\nOnce the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, we will have a solution of Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³. The Fe³⁺ ion is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water, establishing an equilibrium that determines the final pH of the solution:\n\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nTo calculate the pH, we will need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this hydrolysis reaction.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to gather these fundamental constants.\n\nSkeptic: This approach seems logical. We are assuming that the \"minimum volume\" corresponds to the exact stoichiometric amount needed for the neutralization reaction. Any less acid would result in incomplete dissolution. The subsequent pH calculation due to hydrolysis of the resulting ferric ion is also a critical step. We must ensure we find the correct Ka value for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion at or near the specified temperature of 25°C. Let's proceed with finding the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ and the Ka for Fe³⁺.\n\nProposer: The search results provide the necessary constants.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** The consensus from multiple sources is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   **Ka for Fe³⁺ hydrolysis:** One source gives the pKa of Fe³⁺ as about 2.2. Another, more detailed study, reports the first hydrolysis constant (for Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ FeOH²⁺ + H⁺) as log(β₁) = -2.19. This corresponds to a pKa of 2.19. Ka would then be 10⁻².¹⁹.\n\nNow I can proceed with the calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol\n\n**Step 2: Calculate moles of H⁺ needed**\nFrom the stoichiometry Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺, the moles of H⁺ are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid**\nVolume (L) = moles of H⁺ / concentration of acid (0.1 M)\nThen convert the volume from L to cm³ (1 L = 1000 cm³).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the initial concentration of Fe³⁺**\nThe moles of Fe³⁺ formed are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃. The final volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n[Fe³⁺] = moles of Fe³⁺ / 0.1 L\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the equilibrium pH**\nUsing the hydrolysis reaction: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\nAnd the Ka expression: Ka = [H⁺][Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\nWe can set up an ICE table:\nInitial: [Fe³⁺] | 0 | 0\nChange: -x | +x | +x\nEquilibrium: [Fe³⁺] - x | x | x\nSo, Ka = x² / ([Fe³⁺] - x). We can solve this for x, which is [H⁺], and then calculate pH = -log[H⁺].\n\nI will now perform these calculations.\n\nSkeptic: The plan is solid. The constants seem reliable. The only potential pitfall is the assumption that the contribution of H⁺ from the acid used for dissolution does not affect the final pH. However, the problem states the *total* volume is 100 cm³, which includes the volume of acid added. This means the final solution contains only the products of the neutralization (Fe³⁺ and water) diluted to 100 cm³. Therefore, the only source of H⁺ for the final pH calculation is indeed the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. The calculation should be straightforward. Let's proceed.\n\nProposer:\n**Calculations:**\n\n1.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.0009357 moles\n\n2.  **Moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    3 * 0.0009357 moles = 0.0028071 moles H⁺\n\n3.  **Volume of 0.1 M acid:**\n    Volume (L) = 0.0028071 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028071 L\n    Volume (cm³) = 0.028071 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\n4.  **Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    Moles of Fe³⁺ = 0.0009357 moles\n    Total volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n    [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 moles / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\n5.  **pH calculation:**\n    Ka = 10⁻².¹⁹ = 0.006457\n    Ka = x² / (0.009357 - x), where x = [H⁺]\n    0.006457 = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n    x² + 0.006457x - (0.006457 * 0.009357) = 0\n    x² + 0.006457x - 0.00006041 = 0\n\n    Solving the quadratic equation for x (using the quadratic formula x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/2a):\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.006457² - 4*1*(-0.00006041))] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.00004169 + 0.00024164)] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.00028333)] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± 0.016832] / 2\n    Since x must be positive, x = ( -0.006457 + 0.016832) / 2 = 0.010375 / 2 = 0.0051875 M\n    [H⁺] = 0.0051875 M\n\n    pH = -log(0.0051875) = **2.28**\n\nLet me re-check the options. My calculated volume is ~28.07 cm³, which matches option A. My calculated pH is 2.28, which is close to 2.04 in option A. Let me re-evaluate the Ka. The pKa was \"about 2.2\". Let's see what pH I get if I use the pH from option A and work backwards.\n\nIf pH = 2.04, then [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M.\nLet's see if this fits the Ka equation.\nKa = (0.00912)² / (0.009357 - 0.00912) = 0.00008317 / 0.000237 = 0.35. This gives a pKa of 0.45, which is very different from 2.2.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. What if the acid volume is one of the other options?\nLet's assume the answer is D: 30.09 cm³.\nThis implies moles of H⁺ = 0.1 M * 0.03009 L = 0.003009 moles.\nThis would mean moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.003009 / 3 = 0.001003 moles.\nMass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.001003 moles * 106.87 g/mol = 0.107 g. This is close to 0.1g. Let's use this value.\nIf we use 30.09 cm³ of acid, there is a slight excess of H⁺.\nMoles of H⁺ added = 0.003009 mol.\nMoles of H⁺ consumed = 3 * (0.1 / 106.87) = 0.002807 mol.\nExcess moles of H⁺ = 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol.\nConcentration of excess H⁺ = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\nNow we also have the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\n[Fe³⁺] = (0.1 / 106.87) / 0.1 = 0.009357 M.\nThe hydrolysis will produce more H⁺.\nTotal [H⁺] = [H⁺] from excess acid + [H⁺] from hydrolysis.\nThis becomes a common ion effect problem.\nKa = ([H⁺]from hydrolysis + [H⁺]excess) * [Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\nLet y be [H⁺] from hydrolysis.\nKa = (y + 0.00202) * y / (0.009357 - y)\n0.006457 = (y² + 0.00202y) / (0.009357 - y)\nThis is getting complicated and suggests the \"minimum volume\" should be the stoichiometric one.\n\nLet's stick to the first calculation.\nVolume = 28.07 cm³. This strongly points towards option A.\nLet's re-calculate the pH using a slightly different Ka. What if the pKa is slightly higher, leading to a lower pH? No, a higher pKa means a weaker acid and less H⁺, so a higher pH.\nWhat if the pKa is lower? pKa = 2.0. Ka = 10⁻² = 0.01.\nx² + 0.01x - (0.01 * 0.009357) = 0\nx² + 0.01x - 0.00009357 = 0\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.01² - 4*(-0.00009357))] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.0001 + 0.00037428)] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.00047428)] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± 0.02177] / 2\nx = 0.01177 / 2 = 0.005885 M\npH = -log(0.005885) = 2.23.\n\nThe calculation for the volume of acid seems robust: 28.07 cm³. This is very close to 28.05 cm³ in option A. The discrepancy in pH might be due to using a slightly different value for the molar mass or the Ka constant in the source of the problem. However, given the multiple-choice options, the calculated volume is a very strong indicator. The calculated pH of ~2.2-2.3 is also in the same ballpark as 2.04, whereas the other options have vastly different pH values.\n\nLet's re-calculate the volume using the molar mass from another source, e.g., 106.88 g/mol.\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 / 106.88 = 0.0009356 mol\nMoles H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009356 = 0.0028068 mol\nVolume acid = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³. This is still closest to 28.05 cm³.\n\nLet's assume the volume 28.05 cm³ from option A is correct and see what that implies for the molar mass.\nVolume = 0.02805 L\nMoles H⁺ = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.002805 / 3 = 0.000935 mol\nMolar Mass = 0.1 g / 0.000935 mol = 106.95 g/mol. This is a reasonable value.\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.04 from option A is correct and see what that implies for the Ka.\n[H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M\n[Fe³⁺]initial = 0.00935 M (using the moles derived from the volume)\nKa = x² / ([Fe³⁺] - x) = (0.00912)² / (0.00935 - 0.00912) = 0.00008317 / 0.00023 = 0.36.\nThis implies a pKa of 0.44. This is significantly different from the literature value of ~2.2.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options. However, the calculation for the required volume of acid is a direct stoichiometric calculation and is less prone to variations from equilibrium constants. My calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume in option A (28.05 cm³). The other volume options (20.40, 32.14, 30.09) are not close. Therefore, based on the stoichiometric calculation, option A is the most plausible answer, despite the discrepancy in the pH value which likely arises from the problem using a non-standard Ka value.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n2.  Moles H⁺ needed = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n3.  Volume of 0.1 M acid = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\nThis matches the volume in option A.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the pH calculation. Is it possible that the second hydrolysis step is significant?\nFe(OH)²⁺ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₂⁺ + H⁺\nThe log constant for this is -5.76. This is a much smaller Ka, so its contribution should be negligible.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the volume calculation is the intended key to the answer. The pH value provided in the option might be slightly off due to the specific constants used by the source. Based on the strong agreement of the calculated volume, I will select A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Foundational Calculations**\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, to be dissolved.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Total Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**\n*   The number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is:\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009357 mol**\n\n**2. The Chemical Reaction and Acid Requirement**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions from the strong acid serves two purposes:\n*   **Part 1 (Reaction):** An amount of H⁺ is consumed to react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   **Part 2 (Excess):** An additional amount of H⁺ must remain in the solution to establish the final acidic pH, which ensures the Fe(OH)₃ stays dissolved.\n\n**3. Consistency Check of the Options**\n\nThe correct option must be chemically and mathematically self-consistent. We can test each option by calculating the total moles of H⁺ required (Part 1 + Part 2) and seeing if it matches the moles of H⁺ supplied by the given volume of acid.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (Part 1):**\n    Based on the stoichiometry (3 moles of H⁺ per mole of Fe(OH)₃):\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = **0.002807 mol**\n\nNow, we test each option:\n\n**A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ supplied:** Volume × Molarity = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for final pH (Part 2):** [H⁺] × Volume = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol\n*   **Total H⁺ needed (Part 1 + Part 2):** 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The moles supplied (0.003009) and the moles needed (0.003011) are an excellent match. The difference is negligible and due to rounding. **This option is consistent.**\n\n**B) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   The volume of acid supplied (20.40 cm³) is less than the volume required just for the stoichiometric reaction (~28.07 cm³).

The core constraint was that the total moles of H⁺ supplied by the acid must equal the sum of the moles needed for the stoichiometric reaction with Fe(OH)₃ and the moles needed to remain in solution to create the final pH.\n\n*   **Hypotheses A and B** were immediately eliminated because the volume of acid they proposed was insufficient to even dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃, violating the problem's primary condition.\n*   **Hypothesis D** was eliminated because the amount of acid supplied (3.214 x 10⁻³ mol) was significantly different from the calculated required amount (2.876 x 10⁻³ mol), resulting in a large discrepancy of 11.74%.\n*   **Hypothesis C** was found to be highly consistent. The moles of acid supplied (3.009 x 10⁻³ mol) almost perfectly matched the calculated required moles (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol), with a negligible discrepancy of only 0.08%.\n\nTherefore, the script concluded that option C is the only chemically consistent answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n*   O: 15.999 g/mol × 3 = 47.997 g/mol\n*   H: 1.008 g/mol × 3 = 3.024 g/mol\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 55.845 + 47.997 + 3.024 = **106.866 g/mol**\n\nNext, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = **0.00093575 mol**\n\n### Step 2: Determine the volume of strong acid needed\n\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide by a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or HNO₃, represented by H⁺) follows this reaction:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ needed:** 3 × 0.00093575 mol = **0.00280725 mol**\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid that contains this amount of H⁺:\n*   **Volume of acid:** Moles / Concentration = 0.00280725 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280725 L\n*   Converting to cm³: 0.0280725 L × 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis volume is very close to the 28.05 cm³ listed in option B.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter dissolution, the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution contains the Fe³⁺ ions produced. These ions hydrolyze in water, acting as a weak acid and lowering the pH. The primary hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n**[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)**\n\nFor simplicity, this is often written as:\n\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)**\n\nTo find the pH, we need:\n1.  The initial concentration of Fe³⁺.\n2.  The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction.\n\n**1. Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n*   **[Fe³⁺]:** Moles / Total Volume = 0.00093575 mol / 0.1 L = **0.0093575 M**\n\n**2. Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka):**\nThe pKa for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion is approximately 2.2.\n*   **pKa ≈ 2.2**\n*   **Ka = 10⁻²·² ≈ 6.31 × 10⁻³**\n\nNow, we set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the hydrolysis:\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| **Fe³⁺**     | 0.0093575   | -x         | 0.0093575 - x   |\n| **Fe(OH)²⁺** | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| **H⁺**       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n6.31 × 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.0093575 - x)\n\nBecause Ka is relatively large compared to the initial concentration, we cannot use the approximation that 'x' is negligible. We must solve the full quadratic equation:\nx² = (6.31 × 10⁻³)(0.0093575 - x)\nx² = 5.904 × 10⁻⁵ - (6.31 × 10⁻³)x\n**x² + (6.31 × 10⁻³)x - 5.904 × 10⁻⁵ = 0**\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\nx = [-(6.31 × 10⁻³) ± √((6.31 × 10⁻³)² - 4(1)(-5.904 × 10⁻⁵))] / 2(1)\nx = [-0.00631 ± √(3.98 × 10⁻⁵ + 2.36 × 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.00631 ± √(2.758 × 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.00631 ± 0.0166] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\nx = (-0.00631 + 0.0166) / 2\nx = 0.01029 / 2\n**x = 0.005145 M**\n\nThis value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n\nFinally, calculate the pH:\n*   **pH:** -log₁₀[H⁺] = -log₁₀(0.005145) ≈ **2.29**\n\nThe calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm³) and the pH (2.29) are closest to the values in option B (28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04). The discrepancy in pH may arise from using a slightly different pKa value or considering further hydrolysis steps, but it is significantly closer to 2.04 than to the other options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the minimum volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we need to add a strong acid. The acid provides H⁺ ions that react with the OH⁻ ions from the Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction. This reduces the OH⁻ concentration in the solution. According to Le Châtelier's principle, the equilibrium for the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ will shift to the right, causing more of it to dissolve.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe dissolution equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nThis equilibrium is governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp:\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nFor all the Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be, at a minimum, equal to the Ksp. Literature values for the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C vary, but a commonly cited range is between 10⁻³⁹ and 10⁻³⁶.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we find the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles.\n\n**3. Calculate the Concentration of Fe³⁺**\n\nWhen the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution, the concentration of Fe³⁺ will be:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009357 moles / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M.\n\n**4. Determine the Required pH**\n\nWe can now work backward from the provided options. Let's test the values from option D.\n*   If the final pH of the solution is 2.69.\n\nFrom this pH, we can find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n*   pOH = 14 - pH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.³¹ M ≈ 4.898 x 10⁻¹² M\n\nLet's check if this pH is sufficient by calculating the corresponding Ksp value.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.009357) * (4.898 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶\nThis value is within the accepted range for Ksp, indicating that a pH of 2.69 is a plausible condition for dissolving the specified amount of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Amount of Acid Needed**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid (H⁺) required has two components:\n*   **Part A: Acid to react with Fe(OH)₃.**\n    Based on the stoichiometry (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 * 0.0009357 moles = 0.002807 moles.\n\n*   **Part B: Acid to maintain the final pH.**\n    This is the excess H⁺ that remains in the solution to keep it acidic at pH 2.69.\n    [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    Moles H⁺ (solution) = [H⁺] * Volume = 0.002042 M * 0.1 L = 0.0002042 moles.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺** = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (solution)\n    Total Moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = 0.0030112 moles.\n\n**6. Calculate the Volume of the Acid**\n\nThe problem specifies a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid.\n*   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration = 0.0030112 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030112 L.\n\nConverting this volume to cm³:\n*   Volume = 0.030112 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 30.11 cm³.\n\nThese calculated values (pH 2.69; 30.11 cm³) are an excellent match for option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps involving stoichiometry and equilibrium principles.\n\n**1. Reaction and Stoichiometry**\n\nFirst, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid (represented by H+):\n\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions.\n\n**2. Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.867 g/mol.\n\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.867 g/mol = 9.357 x 10^-4 mol\n\n**3. Concentration of Fe3+**\n\nThis amount of Fe(OH)3 dissolves in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The concentration of the resulting Fe3+ ions will be:\n\n*   [Fe3+] = 9.357 x 10^-4 mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10^-3 M\n\n**4. Equilibrium and pH Calculation**\n\nFor the Fe(OH)3 to remain dissolved, the ion product [Fe3+][OH-]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 at 25°C is approximately 2.8 x 10^-39. We use this to find the maximum hydroxide concentration [OH-] allowed in the solution.\n\n*   Ksp = [Fe3+][OH-]³\n*   2.8 x 10^-39 = (9.357 x 10^-3) * [OH-]³\n*   [OH-]³ = (2.8 x 10^-39) / (9.357 x 10^-3) = 2.992 x 10^-37\n*   [OH-] = (2.992 x 10^-37)^(1/3) = 6.688 x 10^-13 M\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of H+ and the pH of the solution using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C).\n\n*   [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1.0 x 10^-14 / 6.688 x 10^-13 M = 0.01495 M\n*   pH = -log[H+] = -log(0.01495) = 2.825\n\nThis pH value is very close to 2.83. Let's re-evaluate with a slightly different Ksp value of 1.6 x 10^-39, which is also commonly cited.\n\n*   [OH-]³ = (1.6 x 10^-39) / (9.357 x 10^-3) = 1.710 x 10^-37\n*   [OH-] = (1.710 x 10^-37)^(1/3) = 5.55 x 10^-13 M\n*   [H+] = 1.0 x 10^-14 / 5.55 x 10^-13 M = 0.0180 M\n*   pH = -log(0.0180) = 2.74\n\nGiven the options, a pH of 2.83 is the most plausible target. Let's proceed with the pH of 2.83, which corresponds to an [H+] of 10^-2.83 = 1.479 x 10^-2 M.\n\n**5. Volume of Acid Required**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid added must do two things:\n*   Neutralize the Fe(OH)3.\n*   Provide the excess H+ ions to maintain the final pH.\n\n*   **Moles of H+ to neutralize Fe(OH)3:**\n    *   From stoichiometry, this is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.\n    *   Moles H+ (reaction) = 3 * 9.357 x 10^-4 mol = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ remaining in solution:**\n    *   This is the amount needed to create the acidic pH in the 100 cm³ solution.\n    *   Moles H+ (excess) = [H+]_final * Volume = (1.479 x 10^-2 M) * 0.1 L = 1.479 x 10^-3 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H+ needed:**\n    *   Total moles = Moles H+ (reaction) + Moles H+ (excess)\n    *   Total moles = 2.807 x 10^-3 + 1.479 x 10^-3 = 4.286 x 10^-3 mol\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this total number of moles.\n\n*   Volume = Total moles / Molarity = 4.286 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04286 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.04286 L * 1000 cm³/L = 42.86 cm³\n\nLet's re-examine the options. None of the options match this calculation. Let's re-calculate using the pH of 2.04 from option D.\n\n*   If pH = 2.04, then [H+] = 10^-2.04 = 0.00912 M.\n*   Moles H+ (excess) = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 9.12 x 10^-4 mol.\n*   Total moles H+ = (2.807 x 10^-3) + (9.12 x 10^-4) = 3.719 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   Volume of acid = 3.719 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³. This is not 28.05 cm³.\n\nLet's try working backwards from the volume in option D, 28.05 cm³.\n\n*   Moles of H+ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   From our calculation, the moles of H+ needed just to react with the Fe(OH)3 is 2.807 x 10^-3 mol.\n\nThese two values are almost identical. The slight difference is likely due to rounding of the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let's assume the moles of H+ added are entirely consumed by the reaction.\n\n*   Moles of H+ added = Moles of H+ reacted = 2.805 x 10^-3 mol.\n*   This implies that there are virtually no excess H+ ions left, which cannot be correct as the solution must be acidic to keep the Fe(OH)3 dissolved.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options. However, let's reconsider the initial stoichiometric calculation. The amount of acid required *just for the neutralization reaction* is:\n\n*   Moles H+ (reaction) = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol\n*   Volume of acid = 2.807 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³\n\nThis volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option D. This suggests that the question assumes the amount of acid needed to lower the pH is negligible compared to the amount needed for the neutralization. If we accept this premise:\n\n*   The required volume is approximately 28.05 cm³.\n*   We must then determine the pH. After the neutralization, we have a solution of Fe3+ ions. Fe3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water:\n    Fe3+(aq) + 2H2O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)2+(aq) + H3O+(aq)\n*   To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe3+(aq). The Ka for Fe3+(aq) is approximately 6.3 x 10^-3.\n*   The concentration of Fe3+ is 9.357 x 10^-3 M.\n*   Ka = [Fe(OH)2+][H3O+] / [Fe3+] = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n*   6.3 x 10^-3 = x² / 0.009357\n*   x² = 5.895 x 10^-5\n*   x = [H3O+] = 7.68 x 10^-3 M\n*   pH = -log(7.68 x 10^-3) = 2.11\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.11 is very close to the pH of 2.04 provided in option D. The small discrepancies arise from using slightly different values for constants (molar mass, Ksp, Ka). Based on this analysis, option D is the most chemically consistent answer, assuming the volume is primarily for neutralization and the pH results from the hydrolysis of the Fe3+ product.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Volume: 28.05 cm³ is the stoichiometric amount for neutralization.\n*   pH: 2.04 is a reasonable pH for a ~0.009 M solution of Fe3+(aq).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main goal is to dissolve 0.1 g of solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a final solution volume of 100 cm³. To do this, we need to add a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of this acid required and the pH of the final solution.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Constants**\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   Total final volume of solution = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   Concentration of strong acid (e.g., HCl) = 0.1 M\n*   Temperature = 25°C\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:\n    *   Fe ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n    *   O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   H ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n    *   M(Fe(OH)₃) = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol\n\n**3. The Chemical Reaction**\nIron(III) hydroxide is a base and is very insoluble in water. It dissolves in acid by reacting with H⁺ ions. The balanced chemical equation for the dissolution is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**4. Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Point 1: Stoichiometry.** The reaction shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n*   **Point 2: Excess Acid.** To ensure the solid dissolves completely and stays dissolved, a certain concentration of H⁺ must be present at equilibrium. This often means a slight excess of acid beyond the stoichiometric amount is needed.\n*   **Point 3: Hydrolysis.** The product of the reaction, the Fe³⁺ ion, is the conjugate acid of a weak base (Fe(OH)²⁺). In water, it hydrolyzes to produce H⁺ ions, which will lower the pH of the solution. The reaction is: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq).\n*   **Point 4: Multiple Choice Strategy.** Since this is a multiple-choice question, we can test the given options to see which one is self-consistent. A common simplification in such problems is to ignore the effect of hydrolysis. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation (Testing the Options)**\n\nLet's test the provided options by calculating the pH that would result from the given volume of acid, assuming the contribution from Fe³⁺ hydrolysis is negligible, and see if it matches the given pH.\n\n**Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**Calculate the moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction (stoichiometric amount):**\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × 9.356 × 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol\n\nNow, let's check **Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added:**\n    *   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (added) = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = 3.009 × 10⁻³ mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ remaining after the reaction:**\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = Moles H⁺ (added) - Moles H⁺ (consumed)\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (excess) = 3.009 × 10⁻³ mol - 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol = 0.202 × 10⁻³ mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess H⁺ in the final solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n    *   [H⁺] from excess acid = Moles of H⁺ (excess) / Total Volume\n    *   [H⁺] = (0.202 × 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 L = 2.02 × 10⁻³ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH from this excess H⁺ concentration (ignoring hydrolysis):**\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺])\n    *   pH = -log₁₀(2.02 × 10⁻³) ≈ 2.695\n\n5.  **Compare:** The calculated pH (2.695) is a very close match to the pH given in Option C (2.69).\n\nLet's briefly check another option to confirm our method.\n**Check Option B: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   Volume of acid = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L\n*   Moles of H⁺ (added) = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 2.805 × 10⁻³ mol\n*   This is almost exactly the stoichiometric amount (2.807 × 10⁻³ mol). There is virtually no excess strong acid. The pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. A detailed calculation shows the pH would be around 2.3-2.6 (depending on the Ka value used), not 2.04. Therefore, Option B is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe values in Option C are arithmetically consistent if one makes the simplifying (though chemically inaccurate) assumption that the pH is determined solely by the excess strong acid and that the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ can be ignored. This is the most plausible intended solution for this problem.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, in a total volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution at 25°C.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Molar Concentration of Fe³⁺\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nThis amount is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n*   [Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n### Step 2: Determine the pH of the Solution\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ is governed by its solubility product, Ksp.\n*   Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be completely dissolved, the ion product must be equal to the Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.8 x 10⁻³⁹.\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   2.8 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n\nNow, we solve for the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (2.8 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.993 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (2.993 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.688 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nFrom the [OH⁻], we can calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.688 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.17\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.17 = 1.83\n\nThis pH is the pH of the final solution. Looking at the options, pH 2.04 is the closest value. Let's re-evaluate using a different Ksp value, as it can vary between sources. Using Ksp = 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹:\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (1.6 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 1.710 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (1.710 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.55 x 10⁻¹³ M\n*   pOH = -log₁₀(5.55 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.26\n*   pH = 14 - 12.26 = 1.74\n\nLet's try the pH from option D, pH = 2.04, to see if it works out.\n*   If pH = 2.04, then pOH = 14 - 2.04 = 11.96\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶ ≈ 1.10 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³) * (1.10 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.24 x 10⁻⁴⁷. This is far from published values.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy. Let's reconsider the problem, accounting for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\nThe Ka for this reaction is about 6.3 x 10⁻³. The problem asks for the minimum acid to dissolve the precipitate, which is dictated by the Ksp equilibrium. The slight variations in Ksp values can lead to different pH results. Let's proceed with the pH of 2.04 from option D and calculate the required acid volume.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Volume of Acid Needed\n\nThe overall reaction with the strong acid (H⁺) is:\n*   Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions added must accomplish two things:\n1.  React with the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Establish the final acidic pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Moles of H⁺ to react with Fe(OH)₃:**\n*   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * (moles of Fe(OH)₃) = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**2. Moles of H⁺ remaining to create the final pH:**\n*   Final pH = 2.04\n*   [H⁺] (final) = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M\n*   Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] (final) * Total Volume = (9.12 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.1 L) = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**Total moles of H⁺ required:**\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**Volume of 0.1 M strong acid:**\n*   Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n*   Volume = (3.719 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.03719 L * 1000 cm³/L = 37.19 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option D (28.05 cm³). Let's re-examine the calculation.\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.69 and volume of 30.09 cm³ from option C is correct and work backward.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ remaining:** [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.04 x 10⁻³ M. Moles = (2.04 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ added:** Volume * Molarity = 0.03009 L * 0.1 M = 3.009 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   **Moles H⁺ reacted:** Total Moles - Moles remaining = (3.009 x 10⁻³) - (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 2.805 x 10⁻³ mol.\nThis value (2.805 x 10⁻³ mol) is extremely close to the stoichiometric amount required to react with the Fe(OH)₃ we calculated earlier (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol). The minor difference is likely due to rounding during the steps.\n\nTherefore, the calculations for option C are consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nFinal check of the pH for option C:\n*   pH = 2.69\n*   pOH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.³¹ ≈ 4.9 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³) * (4.9 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.1 x 10⁻⁴⁵. This Ksp is still inconsistent with published values.\n\nHowever, among the given choices, option C is the only one where the provided volume of acid corresponds almost perfectly to the amount needed to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the given pH. The discrepancy in the Ksp value might stem from using simplified assumptions and not accounting for activity coefficients or the formation of various iron-hydroxy complexes in the solution. Given the multiple-choice format, the most chemically consistent answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe analysis is correct. The provided code output confirms the reasoning.\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Calculation**: The minimum volume of acid required just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ is calculated to be ~28.07 cm³. This eliminates options B and D, as they provide less acid than is stoichiometrically necessary.\n\n2.  **Charge Balance Verification**: The final solution must be electrically neutral. The principle of charge balance (3[Fe³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [A⁻]) is used to check the consistency of the remaining options.\n\n3.  **Code Output Interpretation**:\n    *   For **Option A**, a pH of 2.69 requires a calculated acid volume of 30.11 cm³. This is an excellent match for the given volume of 30.09 cm³.\n    *   For **Option C**, a pH of 3.16 requires a calculated acid volume of 28.76 cm³. This is a significant mismatch with the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\nThe only option that is physically and chemically consistent is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options provide pairs of pH and volume values. The correct option must be self-consistent.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 corresponding to 0.1 g.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is calculated as:\n    Molar Mass(Fe) + 3 * (Molar Mass(O) + Molar Mass(H))\n    = 55.845 g/mol + 3 * (15.999 g/mol + 1.008 g/mol)\n    = 55.845 + 3 * (17.007) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass\n    = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the chemical reaction and acid requirement**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of acid (H⁺) added serves two purposes:\n1.  **Reaction:** To react stoichiometrically with all the Fe(OH)3.\n2.  **Final pH:** To remain in the solution as excess H⁺, which determines the final pH.\n\nTotal moles of H⁺ added = (Moles of H⁺ for reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution)\n\n**Step 3: Test the given options for consistency**\n\nWe will test each option by using the given pH to calculate the required volume of acid and comparing it to the volume given in that option.\n\nLet's test **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ for the reaction:**\n    From the stoichiometry (1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺):\n    Moles H⁺ (reaction) = 3 * Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Calculate moles of H⁺ remaining in the solution:**\n    The final pH is 2.69. The concentration of H⁺ is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ.\n    [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M\n    The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    Moles H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] * Volume = (2.042 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * 0.1 L = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reaction) + Moles H⁺ (remaining)\n    = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid required:**\n    Volume = Total Moles / Molarity\n    Volume = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03011 L\n\n*   **Convert volume to cm³ and compare:**\n    Volume = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is extremely close to the volume given in Option B (30.09 cm³). The minor difference is due to rounding of constants. This indicates that Option B is the correct, self-consistent answer.\n\nThe provided code execution confirms this calculation:\n`Calculated acid volume for pH 2.69: 30.11 cm3`\n`Given acid volume in option B: 30.09 cm3`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe consistency check shows that only Option A has a calculated acid volume that matches the volume given in the option.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** 0.000936 mol.\n*   **Reaction:** Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for reaction:** 3 * 0.000936 mol = 0.002808 mol.\n*   **Check Option A:**\n    *   Given pH = 2.69. This means final [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.00204 M.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ needed to achieve this pH in 0.1 L: 0.00204 M * 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ needed:** 0.002808 mol (for reaction) + 0.000204 mol (for pH) = 0.003012 mol.\n    *   **Volume of 0.1 M acid needed:** 0.003012 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03012 L = 30.12 cm³.\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculated volume of 30.12 cm³ is extremely close to the 30.09 cm³ given in Option A. The other options were shown to be inconsistent. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo solve this problem, we will perform a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the final pH of the solution.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.**\n    First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃. The molar mass is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n2.  **Write the reaction for dissolution in acid.**\n    Iron(III) hydroxide is a basic salt that reacts with a strong acid (represented by H⁺) in a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction.**\n    From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n4.  **Determine the final concentration of Fe³⁺.**\n    The 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Volume\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the equilibrium H⁺ concentration needed to keep Fe(OH)₃ dissolved.**\n    For the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. We will calculate the condition at the limit, where the solution is saturated. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.0 x 10⁻³⁹ mol⁴dm⁻¹².\n    *   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    *   2.0 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n    *   [OH⁻]³ = (2.0 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.139 x 10⁻³⁷\n    *   [OH⁻] = (2.139 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.98 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\n    Now, we use the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C) to find the required hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].\n    *   [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (5.98 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 0.0167 M\n\n6.  **Calculate the final pH of the solution.**\n    *   pH = -log[H⁺]\n    *   pH = -log(0.0167) ≈ 2.78\n\n7.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required.**\n    The total amount of acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacts with Fe(OH)₃ and the acid that remains in the solution to maintain the pH.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] * Total Volume\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = 0.0167 M * 0.1 L = 1.67 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = Moles of H⁺ (reacted) + Moles of H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol + 1.67 x 10⁻³ mol = 4.477 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n8.  **Calculate the minimum volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.**\n    *   Volume = Total moles of H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n    *   Volume = 4.477 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04477 L\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.04477 L * 1000 cm³/L = 44.77 cm³\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated pH is approximately 2.78, and the required volume of the strong acid is 44.77 cm³. Comparing these results to the given options:\n\n*   A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the calculated values. However, option D has a pH of 2.69, which is the closest to our calculated pH of 2.78. The discrepancy in volume may arise from using slightly different values for the molar mass or Ksp, or from a different interpretation of the problem's conditions. Given the choices, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps involving stoichiometry and equilibrium principles.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\nFirst, we determine the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Atomic Mass of Fe) + 3 * (Atomic Mass of O) + 3 * (Atomic Mass of H)\nMolar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.845 + 3*(16.00) + 3*(1.008) = 106.869 g/mol.\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles.\n\n**2. Stoichiometry of the Dissolution Reaction:**\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) proceeds according to the following reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\nFrom the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to react with every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\nMoles of H⁺ reacted = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\n**3. Determine the Final pH using the Solubility Product (Ksp):**\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved, the ion product of its dissolved ions must be less than or equal to its solubility product constant, Ksp. The equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nThe Ksp expression is Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³.\nThe concentration of Fe³⁺ in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n[Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M.\nThe Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹.\nNow, we can calculate the maximum hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] that can be present before Fe(OH)₃ precipitates:\n1.6 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n[OH⁻]³ = (1.6 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 1.710 x 10⁻³⁷ M³\n[OH⁻] = (1.710 x 10⁻³⁷)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 5.55 x 10⁻¹³ M.\nNow we can find the pOH and then the pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(5.55 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.26\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.26 = 1.74.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Acid Needed:**\nThe total amount of strong acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacted with the Fe(OH)₃ and the excess acid required to maintain the final pH.\nFirst, find the concentration of H⁺ at the final pH:\n[H⁺]final = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻¹·⁷⁴ ≈ 1.82 x 10⁻² M.\nNext, calculate the moles of excess H⁺ in the 100 cm³ solution:\nMoles of excess H⁺ = [H⁺]final * Volume = (1.82 x 10⁻² mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 1.82 x 10⁻³ moles.\nNow, find the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:\nTotal moles H⁺ = (moles of H⁺ reacted) + (moles of excess H⁺)\nTotal moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles) + (1.82 x 10⁻³ moles) = 4.627 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\n**5. Calculate the Volume of the Acid:**\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed:\nVolume = Total moles H⁺ / Molarity = (4.627 x 10⁻³ moles) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.04627 L.\nConverting this volume to cm³:\nVolume = 0.04627 L * 1000 cm³/L = 46.27 cm³.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options based on these calculations. None of the options match. There might be a different Ksp value used for the problem's intended answer. Let's re-calculate using the pH from option C (pH = 2.04) to see if the corresponding volume matches.\n\n**Re-calculation assuming pH = 2.04:**\nIf the final pH is 2.04, then:\n[H⁺]final = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M.\nMoles of excess H⁺ = (9.12 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ moles.\nTotal moles H⁺ = (moles of H⁺ reacted) + (moles of excess H⁺)\nTotal moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴ moles) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ moles.\nVolume of acid = (3.719 x 10⁻³ moles) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\nThis does not match the volume in option C (28.05 cm³).\n\nLet's try working backward from the volume in option C (28.05 cm³).\nMoles of H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10⁻³ moles.\nThis amount is almost exactly the amount needed just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ (2.807 x 10⁻³ moles). This implies there is virtually no excess acid, which would result in a much higher pH.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options or the standard Ksp values. However, let's re-examine the initial calculation. The pH of 1.74 is closest to 2.04 among the choices. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 / 106.869 = 0.0009357 mol\nMoles H⁺ reacted = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol\n[Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 / 0.1 = 0.009357 M\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.04 from option C is correct and check the Ksp value that would result.\nIf pH = 2.04, pOH = 11.96.\n[OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·⁹⁶ ≈ 1.10 x 10⁻¹² M.\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.009357) * (1.10 x 10⁻¹²)³ ≈ 1.24 x 10⁻⁴⁴. This is a plausible, though different, value for Ksp.\n\nNow let's calculate the volume of acid required for a pH of 2.04.\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ * 0.1 = 0.000912 mol.\nTotal moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.000912 = 0.003719 mol.\nVolume acid = 0.003719 / 0.1 = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option C (28.05 cm³). Let's re-calculate using the volume from option C and find the resulting pH.\nMoles H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\nMoles H⁺ reacted = 0.002807 mol.\nThis is a slight deficit of H⁺, meaning not all the Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the mass of Fe(OH)₃ and work backwards from option C.\nAssume pH = 2.04 and Volume = 28.05 cm³ are correct.\nTotal moles H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.\nMoles H⁺ reacted = Total moles - excess moles = 0.002805 - 0.000912 = 0.001893 mol.\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = Moles H⁺ reacted / 3 = 0.001893 / 3 = 0.000631 mol.\nMass Fe(OH)₃ = 0.000631 mol * 106.869 g/mol = 0.0674 g.\nIf the initial mass was 0.0674 g instead of 0.1 g, option C would be correct.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, let's reconsider the problem as stated. It's possible a different Ksp value is intended. A common literature value for Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ is around 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\nUsing Ksp = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹:\n[OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (0.009357) ≈ 2.98 x 10⁻³⁷\n[OH⁻] ≈ 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M\npOH = -log(6.68 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.18\npH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82\nThis pH is still closest to 2.04. The associated volume would be:\nMoles excess H⁺ = 10⁻¹·⁸² * 0.1 = 0.00151 mol\nTotal moles H⁺ = 0.002807 + 0.00151 = 0.004317 mol\nVolume = 0.004317 / 0.1 = 0.04317 L = 43.17 cm³\n\nGiven the provided options, there is a high probability of an error in the question's data. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" fit, the calculated pH values (1.74-1.82) are in the same range as the pH in option C (2.04), while the other options are further away. The calculated volumes do not align with any option. Let's assume the intended answer is C, likely due to the use of specific, non-standard textbook values or a typo in the problem statement.\n\nFinal check of logic: The process of calculating moles of reactant, determining the required final pH for dissolution via Ksp, calculating the excess acid needed for that pH, and summing the reacted and excess acid to find the total volume is chemically sound. The discrepancy arises from the numerical values provided in the options not matching the results of these sound calculations with standard chemical data. Based on the closest pH value, C is the most plausible intended answer despite the volume mismatch.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the minimum volume of acid needed and the resulting pH.\n\n**1. Molar Mass and Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n*   O: 15.999 g/mol\n*   H: 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNext, we find the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n\n**2. Dissolution Reaction and Stoichiometry**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) proceeds as follows:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions. Therefore, the moles of H⁺ required to react with the Fe(OH)₃ are:\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.0028071 mol\n\n**3. Equilibrium pH for Dissolution**\n\nTo ensure all the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\nNow, we can find the maximum hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] allowed at equilibrium for the iron(III) hydroxide to remain dissolved:\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (0.009357) * [OH⁻]³\n*   [OH⁻]³ = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ / 0.009357 = 2.982 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (2.982 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nWith the hydroxide concentration, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH of the resulting solution:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.68 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.18\n*   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82\n\nThis pH is the pH of the final solution. Looking at the options, pH 2.04 is the closest. Let's re-evaluate using a slightly different Ksp value, as it can vary between sources. For instance, a Ksp of 6 x 10⁻³⁸ gives a pH of 2.27. A Ksp of 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹ gives a pH of 1.77. Let's proceed with the calculation using the pH from option D (2.04) to see if the volume matches.\n\n**4. Total Acid Required**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacts with the Fe(OH)₃ and the acid that remains in the solution to maintain the final pH.\n\nLet's assume the final pH is 2.04. The concentration of free H⁺ ions is:\n*   [H⁺] (free) = 10⁻²⁰⁴ ≈ 0.00912 M\n\nThe moles of free H⁺ in the 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution are:\n*   Moles of H⁺ (free) = Concentration * Volume = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n\nNow, we calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ = Moles of H⁺ (reacted) + Moles of H⁺ (free)\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ = 0.0028071 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.0037191 mol\n\n**5. Volume of the Strong Acid**\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to provide this total amount of H⁺:\n*   Volume = Total Moles / Molarity = 0.0037191 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.037191 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.037191 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 37.19 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) is not a close match to the 28.05 cm³ in option D. Let's re-calculate using the values from option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³).\n\n*   [H⁺] (free) = 10⁻²⁶⁹ ≈ 0.00204 M\n*   Moles of H⁺ (free) = 0.00204 M * 0.1 L = 0.000204 mol\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ = 0.0028071 mol + 0.000204 mol = 0.0030111 mol\n*   Volume = 0.0030111 mol / 0.1 M = 0.030111 L ≈ 30.11 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (30.11 cm³) is an excellent match for the volume in option C (30.09 cm³). The slight difference can be attributed to rounding during intermediate steps or a slightly different molar mass or Ksp value used in the problem's source. The pH of 2.69 corresponds to a Ksp value in the range of 10⁻³⁶, which is also a cited value.\n\nTherefore, the combination of pH 2.69 and a required volume of approximately 30.09 cm³ is the most consistent and correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the chemical reaction that occurs. Ferric hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, is a sparingly soluble base that reacts with a strong acid (let's denote it as HA, which provides H⁺ ions) in a neutralization reaction. The reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nTo calculate the minimum volume of the acid required, we need to find the stoichiometric amount of H⁺ ions needed to react completely with 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃. This requires the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n\nOnce the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, we will have a solution of Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³. The Fe³⁺ ion is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water, establishing an equilibrium that determines the final pH of the solution:\n\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nTo calculate the pH, we will need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this hydrolysis reaction.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to gather these fundamental constants.\n\nSkeptic: This approach seems logical. We are assuming that the \"minimum volume\" corresponds to the exact stoichiometric amount needed for the neutralization reaction. Any less acid would result in incomplete dissolution. The subsequent pH calculation due to hydrolysis of the resulting ferric ion is also a critical step. We must ensure we find the correct Ka value for the hydrated Fe³⁺ ion at or near the specified temperature of 25°C. Let's proceed with finding the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ and the Ka for Fe³⁺.\n\nProposer: The search results provide the necessary constants.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** The consensus from multiple sources is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   **Ka for Fe³⁺ hydrolysis:** One source gives the pKa of Fe³⁺ as about 2.2. Another, more detailed study, reports the first hydrolysis constant (for Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ FeOH²⁺ + H⁺) as log(β₁) = -2.19. This corresponds to a pKa of 2.19. Ka would then be 10⁻².¹⁹.\n\nNow I can proceed with the calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol\n\n**Step 2: Calculate moles of H⁺ needed**\nFrom the stoichiometry Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺, the moles of H⁺ are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid**\nVolume (L) = moles of H⁺ / concentration of acid (0.1 M)\nThen convert the volume from L to cm³ (1 L = 1000 cm³).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the initial concentration of Fe³⁺**\nThe moles of Fe³⁺ formed are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃. The final volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n[Fe³⁺] = moles of Fe³⁺ / 0.1 L\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the equilibrium pH**\nUsing the hydrolysis reaction: Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\nAnd the Ka expression: Ka = [H⁺][Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\nWe can set up an ICE table:\nInitial: [Fe³⁺] | 0 | 0\nChange: -x | +x | +x\nEquilibrium: [Fe³⁺] - x | x | x\nSo, Ka = x² / ([Fe³⁺] - x). We can solve this for x, which is [H⁺], and then calculate pH = -log[H⁺].\n\nI will now perform these calculations.\n\nSkeptic: The plan is solid. The constants seem reliable. The only potential pitfall is the assumption that the contribution of H⁺ from the acid used for dissolution does not affect the final pH. However, the problem states the *total* volume is 100 cm³, which includes the volume of acid added. This means the final solution contains only the products of the neutralization (Fe³⁺ and water) diluted to 100 cm³. Therefore, the only source of H⁺ for the final pH calculation is indeed the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. The calculation should be straightforward. Let's proceed.\n\nProposer:\n**Calculations:**\n\n1.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.0009357 moles\n\n2.  **Moles of H⁺ needed:**\n    3 * 0.0009357 moles = 0.0028071 moles H⁺\n\n3.  **Volume of 0.1 M acid:**\n    Volume (L) = 0.0028071 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028071 L\n    Volume (cm³) = 0.028071 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\n4.  **Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    Moles of Fe³⁺ = 0.0009357 moles\n    Total volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n    [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 moles / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\n5.  **pH calculation:**\n    Ka = 10⁻².¹⁹ = 0.006457\n    Ka = x² / (0.009357 - x), where x = [H⁺]\n    0.006457 = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n    x² + 0.006457x - (0.006457 * 0.009357) = 0\n    x² + 0.006457x - 0.00006041 = 0\n\n    Solving the quadratic equation for x (using the quadratic formula x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/2a):\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.006457² - 4*1*(-0.00006041))] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.00004169 + 0.00024164)] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± sqrt(0.00028333)] / 2\n    x = [-0.006457 ± 0.016832] / 2\n    Since x must be positive, x = ( -0.006457 + 0.016832) / 2 = 0.010375 / 2 = 0.0051875 M\n    [H⁺] = 0.0051875 M\n\n    pH = -log(0.0051875) = **2.28**\n\nLet me re-check the options. My calculated volume is ~28.07 cm³, which matches option A. My calculated pH is 2.28, which is close to 2.04 in option A. Let me re-evaluate the Ka. The pKa was \"about 2.2\". Let's see what pH I get if I use the pH from option A and work backwards.\n\nIf pH = 2.04, then [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M.\nLet's see if this fits the Ka equation.\nKa = (0.00912)² / (0.009357 - 0.00912) = 0.00008317 / 0.000237 = 0.35. This gives a pKa of 0.45, which is very different from 2.2.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. What if the acid volume is one of the other options?\nLet's assume the answer is D: 30.09 cm³.\nThis implies moles of H⁺ = 0.1 M * 0.03009 L = 0.003009 moles.\nThis would mean moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.003009 / 3 = 0.001003 moles.\nMass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.001003 moles * 106.87 g/mol = 0.107 g. This is close to 0.1g. Let's use this value.\nIf we use 30.09 cm³ of acid, there is a slight excess of H⁺.\nMoles of H⁺ added = 0.003009 mol.\nMoles of H⁺ consumed = 3 * (0.1 / 106.87) = 0.002807 mol.\nExcess moles of H⁺ = 0.003009 - 0.002807 = 0.000202 mol.\nConcentration of excess H⁺ = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\nNow we also have the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\n[Fe³⁺] = (0.1 / 106.87) / 0.1 = 0.009357 M.\nThe hydrolysis will produce more H⁺.\nTotal [H⁺] = [H⁺] from excess acid + [H⁺] from hydrolysis.\nThis becomes a common ion effect problem.\nKa = ([H⁺]from hydrolysis + [H⁺]excess) * [Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\nLet y be [H⁺] from hydrolysis.\nKa = (y + 0.00202) * y / (0.009357 - y)\n0.006457 = (y² + 0.00202y) / (0.009357 - y)\nThis is getting complicated and suggests the \"minimum volume\" should be the stoichiometric one.\n\nLet's stick to the first calculation.\nVolume = 28.07 cm³. This strongly points towards option A.\nLet's re-calculate the pH using a slightly different Ka. What if the pKa is slightly higher, leading to a lower pH? No, a higher pKa means a weaker acid and less H⁺, so a higher pH.\nWhat if the pKa is lower? pKa = 2.0. Ka = 10⁻² = 0.01.\nx² + 0.01x - (0.01 * 0.009357) = 0\nx² + 0.01x - 0.00009357 = 0\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.01² - 4*(-0.00009357))] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.0001 + 0.00037428)] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± sqrt(0.00047428)] / 2\nx = [-0.01 ± 0.02177] / 2\nx = 0.01177 / 2 = 0.005885 M\npH = -log(0.005885) = 2.23.\n\nThe calculation for the volume of acid seems robust: 28.07 cm³. This is very close to 28.05 cm³ in option A. The discrepancy in pH might be due to using a slightly different value for the molar mass or the Ka constant in the source of the problem. However, given the multiple-choice options, the calculated volume is a very strong indicator. The calculated pH of ~2.2-2.3 is also in the same ballpark as 2.04, whereas the other options have vastly different pH values.\n\nLet's re-calculate the volume using the molar mass from another source, e.g., 106.88 g/mol.\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 / 106.88 = 0.0009356 mol\nMoles H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009356 = 0.0028068 mol\nVolume acid = 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm³. This is still closest to 28.05 cm³.\n\nLet's assume the volume 28.05 cm³ from option A is correct and see what that implies for the molar mass.\nVolume = 0.02805 L\nMoles H⁺ = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.002805 / 3 = 0.000935 mol\nMolar Mass = 0.1 g / 0.000935 mol = 106.95 g/mol. This is a reasonable value.\n\nLet's assume the pH of 2.04 from option A is correct and see what that implies for the Ka.\n[H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ = 0.00912 M\n[Fe³⁺]initial = 0.00935 M (using the moles derived from the volume)\nKa = x² / ([Fe³⁺] - x) = (0.00912)² / (0.00935 - 0.00912) = 0.00008317 / 0.00023 = 0.36.\nThis implies a pKa of 0.44. This is significantly different from the literature value of ~2.2.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's options. However, the calculation for the required volume of acid is a direct stoichiometric calculation and is less prone to variations from equilibrium constants. My calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the volume in option A (28.05 cm³). The other volume options (20.40, 32.14, 30.09) are not close. Therefore, based on the stoichiometric calculation, option A is the most plausible answer, despite the discrepancy in the pH value which likely arises from the problem using a non-standard Ka value.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n2.  Moles H⁺ needed = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n3.  Volume of 0.1 M acid = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\nThis matches the volume in option A.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the pH calculation. Is it possible that the second hydrolysis step is significant?\nFe(OH)²⁺ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₂⁺ + H⁺\nThe log constant for this is -5.76. This is a much smaller Ka, so its contribution should be negligible.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the volume calculation is the intended key to the answer. The pH value provided in the option might be slightly off due to the specific constants used by the source. Based on the strong agreement of the calculated volume, I will select A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
