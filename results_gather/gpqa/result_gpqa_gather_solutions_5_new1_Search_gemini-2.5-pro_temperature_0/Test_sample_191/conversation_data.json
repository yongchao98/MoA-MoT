This means its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.\n    *   According to the principles of electrostatics, this charge $+q$ will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** To cancel the electric field inside the conducting material, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If you imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the conductor, enclosing the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero. For the net flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, the charge on the inner wall must be $-q$ to cancel the $+q$ inside.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface. (Total charge on conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = -q + (+q) = 0$).\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A key property of a closed conducting shell (like our conductor with a cavity) is that it acts as an electrostatic shield.\n    *   The charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall) produce an electric field. However, the conductor completely cancels this field outside the cavity. The net electric field produced by the charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ is zero everywhere outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at any point P outside the conductor is due *only* to the charge present on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Electric Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   We have determined that the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor is $+q$.\n    *   The problem states that the conductor is spherical (with radius $R$). Due to the symmetry of the sphere and the absence of any external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n    *   For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (this is a result from Gauss's Law, often called Newton's Shell Theorem for electrostatics).\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The electric field at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law, the magnitude of the electric field $E$ at a distance $L$ from a point charge $q$ is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors. The shielding effect of the conductor simplifies the problem significantly. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the neutral conductor will attract the free electrons within the conductor. This causes a charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially uncharged, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges inside the cavity and on the inner surface are shielded from the outside, and conversely, the charges on the outer surface are shielded from the specific arrangement of charges inside. This means the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is independent of the position of the charge `+q` or the cavity inside.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this surface to minimize repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the shell theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is calculated as if a point charge `+q` were located at the center of the large conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other variables, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its position `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This would be the field if the conductor were absent.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor to ensure the electric field within the conductor's material is zero. Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage effect):** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The combined electric field at any point outside the conductor due to the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's inner wall is zero.\n4.  **Field due to Outer Charge:** Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n5.  **Symmetry and Charge Distribution:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P.

Inside this conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the conductor is $O_c$ and the center of the cavity is $O_v$. The distance between these centers is $s$. A point charge $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. The distance of P from the conductor's center $O_c$ is $L$, and its distance from the cavity's center $O_v$ is $l$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity (Charge Induction)**\n1.  The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  To determine the amount of induced charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n3.  A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n4.  According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through our Gaussian surface is zero, which implies that the net charge enclosed by this surface must be zero.\n5.  The net charge enclosed is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity, $q_{inner}$.\n6.  Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the charge on the outer surface of the conductor**\n1.  The conductor was initially uncharged, meaning its net charge was zero.\n2.  Charge is conserved. The total charge of the conductor must remain zero. The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$).\n3.  So, $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n4.  Substituting the value of $q_{inner}$ from Step 2, we get $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n5.  This implies that $q_{outer} = +q$. A total charge of $+q$ must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the principle of electrostatic shielding**\n1.  A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. A closed conducting shell (like our spherical conductor) shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it.\n2.  This means that the distribution of the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity or the off-center position of the cavity itself.\n3.  The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the inner charges were not there. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges, this charge $+q$ will spread out uniformly over the surface.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the electric field outside the conductor**\n1.  The electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a single point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the shell.\n2.  In our case, the outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$ centered at $O_c$. It has a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly.\n3.  The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, $O_c$.\n4.  Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n5.  Substituting $q_{outer} = +q$, we get:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **The conductor is a shield:** The key principle is that the conducting material shields the outside from the inside. The only information that \"gets out\" is the net charge that is forced onto the outer surface.\n*   **Irrelevant information:** The specific location of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity, the radius of the cavity $r$, the distance between centers $s$, the distance from the cavity center $l$, and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided to potentially distract or test the understanding of the shielding principle. These parameters would be necessary if we were asked to find the field *inside* the cavity.\n*   **Symmetry of the outer surface:** The problem is simplified because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere. This allows the induced charge $+q$ to distribute uniformly, leading to a simple $1/L^2$ field. If the conductor were not spherical, the charge on the outer surface would not be uniform, and the external field would be more complex to calculate, but it would still be independent of the details of the cavity's interior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is determined solely by the charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity:**\n    The positive charge $+q$ is placed inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. Conductors contain mobile charges (electrons) that will redistribute themselves in the presence of an electric field. The $+q$ charge will attract the mobile electrons in the conductor.\n\n2.  **Induced charge on the inner surface:**\n    The electrons in the conductor will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge and will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. This creates a net negative charge on the inner surface. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law.\n    Consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the bulk of the conductor, enclosing the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of a conductor must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this closed surface is proportional to the net charge enclosed: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed, $q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    $q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Induced charge on the outer surface:**\n    The problem states that the spherical conductor was initially uncharged. The conductor as a whole must remain electrically neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface (by moving from other parts of the conductor), a net charge of $+q$ must be left behind on the conductor. These positive charges (which are actually the atomic nuclei left behind by the mobile electrons) will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n    So, a charge of $q_{outer} = +q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor produce zero electric field inside the conductor. Conversely, the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner surface) produce a net zero electric field everywhere *outside* the cavity.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is caused *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor. The internal configuration (the charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$) does not contribute to the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since the conductor is an equipotential volume in equilibrium, and the outer surface is spherical, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. The non-uniformity of the fields inside the cavity does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    According to the shell theorem (which is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. They are extraneous information intended to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P ($L$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, the accumulation of `-q` on the inner surface leaves a net positive charge of `+q` on the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, this excess charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The charges on the inner surface of the cavity (`-q`) and the charge `+q` inside the cavity arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is cancelled out within the conducting material itself. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the specific location (`s`, `r`, `l`, `Î¸`) of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n4.  **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced solely by the charge distributed on the outer surface. Because the outer surface is a sphere of radius `R`, the induced charge `+q` will spread uniformly over this surface.\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law (or Shell Theorem):** For a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge equal to the total charge of the sphere, located at its center.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, `r`, and the angle `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, `-q`, on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law, which states that the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). To maintain its overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to balance the `-q` induced on the inner surface.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) have no effect on the electric field outside the conductor. The electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the shielding effect, the `+q` charge on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the charge `+q` or the cavity inside. Because the conductor is a sphere, this outer charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field can be calculated as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. In this case, the uniformly distributed `+q` on the outer surface creates an electric field at point P as if it were a point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.

This causes a charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. This means that the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is completely independent of the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Charge Distribution:** Due to the symmetrical shape of the outer surface (a sphere), the induced charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over this surface to minimize potential energy.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), for any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the point P is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface. Since P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, the magnitude of the electric field is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge.\n\nThe formula is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe variables `l`, `s`, and `Î¸`, which describe the position of the charge within the cavity, are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. A positive charge `+q` is placed within this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. According to Gauss's Law, if we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to cancel out the `+q` charge.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface of the cavity, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges placed inside it. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on its outer surface. The specific location of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the non-uniform distribution of the `-q` charge on the inner wall do not affect the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface is a sphere and it's a conductor, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to achieve electrostatic equilibrium (i.e., to minimize the electrostatic potential energy).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to the Shell Theorem (a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge `+q` located at the center O.\n\n8.  **Final Formula:** The magnitude of the electric field from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n\n    Substituting our values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters provided in the problem, such as the radius of the cavity (`r`), the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center to point P (`l`), and the angle (`theta`), are all irrelevant to the calculation of the electric field outside the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. They are included as distractors.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We have an uncharged (neutral) spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to the principles of electrostatics, a charge inside a cavity of a conductor will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of that cavity. This happens to ensure that the electric field inside the conducting material itself is zero. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the spherical cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface from the conductor's free electrons, a net positive charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface of the conductor are shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (the original charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface). Consequently, the distribution of the $+q$ charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the outer surface of the conductor is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the internal charges, the $+q$ charge will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The original charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n\n    However, due to electrostatic shielding, the net electric field produced outside the conductor by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n8.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A well-known result from Gauss's law is that the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the outer sphere is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is $L$.\n\n    Treating the outer charge distribution as a point charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

When a positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity, it will interact with the free charges (electrons) within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface.** The positive charge `+q` will attract the free electrons in the conductor. These electrons will move and accumulate on the surface of the cavity. To find the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law.\n    *   Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through our Gaussian surface is $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on this Gaussian surface, the total flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$.\n    *   Therefore, we have the equation: $+q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   Solving for the induced charge on the inner surface gives $q_{inner} = -q$. This charge `-q` will distribute itself non-uniformly on the inner surface to ensure the electric field is zero within the conductor.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface.** The conductor was initially neutral. By the law of conservation of charge, if a charge of `-q` has moved from the bulk of the conductor to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind. In a conductor, any net charge resides on its outermost surface. Therefore, a charge of $q_{outer} = +q$ will appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the Outer Surface Charge (Electrostatic Shielding).** This is the most critical step. The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield (a Faraday cage). It completely isolates the region outside the conductor from the electric fields of the charges located inside the cavity. The combined electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero for all points outside the conductor.\n    *   Because of this shielding, the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Electric Field at the External Point P.** The total electric field at point P is the vector sum of the fields from all charges: (1) the charge `+q` in the cavity, (2) the charge `-q` on the inner surface, and (3) the charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n    *   As established by the shielding principle, the combined electric field from the charges inside (source 1 and 2) is zero at point P.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the charge `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Apply the Shell Theorem.** The Shell Theorem (a result derived from Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this surface is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as `L`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation.** Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    Substituting our values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's position (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`\\theta`) are all distractors. The physics of electrostatic shielding simplifies the problem, making the external field dependent only on the total induced charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We begin with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the total charge on the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge `+q`:** A positive charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field (`E`) inside the material of a conductor must be zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since `E = 0` everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the total flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity (`+q`) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This gives us $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this charge might be non-uniform, depending on the exact location of `+q` inside the cavity, but the total amount is fixed at `-q`.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. These positive charges will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n    *   So, a charge of $q_{outer} = +q$ appears on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Shielding Effect (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. The charges on the conductor rearrange themselves to ensure this. The field produced by the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is completely cancelled outside the cavity by the conductor. Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the net electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero.\n\n6.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges inside the cavity. From the perspective of the charges on the outer surface, they are simply on a spherical conductor. To achieve electrostatic equilibrium (the lowest energy state), these charges will spread out uniformly over the spherical outer surface of radius `R`.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The total electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields from all charges.\n    *   $\\vec{E}_P = \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q in cavity})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from -q on inner surface})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q on outer surface})}$\n    *   As established by the shielding principle, the first two terms sum to zero for any point outside the conductor: $\\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q in cavity})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from -q on inner surface})} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the field at P is solely due to the charge `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer surface: $\\vec{E}_P = \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q on outer surface})}$.\n\n8.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** The shell theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   We have a total charge of `+q` uniformly distributed on the outer sphere of radius `R`, centered at O.\n    *   Point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   The magnitude of the electric field at P is therefore the same as that of a point charge `+q` at O.\n    *   $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The specific details about the cavity's location (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from P to the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

This happens so that the electric field inside the bulk of the conductor remains zero, a key property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.\n2.  **Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. The conductor effectively isolates the region outside it from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface.\n4.  **Field from the Outer Charge:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor will distribute itself uniformly over that surface. This is because the outer surface is a sphere, and in the absence of other external charges, the distribution will be symmetric.\n5.  **Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` at O, which is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters like `r`, `s`, `l`, and `Î¸` describe the internal geometry but do not affect the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.

Let's call its center O and its radius R.\n*   Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity. Let's call its center C and its radius r. The distance between O and C is $s$.\n*   A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n*   We need to find the electric field at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The distance from the conductor's center O to P is $L$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors.**\n*   **Charge Induction:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will move and accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). To completely cancel the electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the bulk of the conductor material, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n*   **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. Since charges in a conductor can only reside on its surfaces, this $+q$ charge will spread out over the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the charge distribution on the outer surface.**\n*   We now have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   The outer surface is a perfect sphere of radius $R$.\n*   A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the charge on its surface will arrange itself to make the conductor an equipotential volume. In the absence of any external electric fields, the most symmetric distribution is the most stable. Therefore, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself *uniformly* over the spherical outer surface.\n*   **Careful Point:** The position of the cavity and the charge inside it are irregular and non-symmetric with respect to the center O. However, this does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface. The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. The field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero, effectively isolating the \"inside world\" (the cavity) from the \"outside world\". The only thing the outside world \"knows\" is that a total charge of $+q$ has appeared on the outer surface.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the electric field at point P.**\n*   The electric field at the external point P is the result of all charges in the system. By the principle of superposition, this is the sum of the fields from:\n    1.  The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    2.  The induced charge $-q$ on the inner cavity surface.\n    3.  The induced charge $+q$ on the outer conductor surface.\n*   **Key Concept (Shell Theorem / Gauss's Law):** The electric field produced by the charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the cavity wall) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. The conductor shields the external point P from these internal charges.\n*   Therefore, the only source that contributes to the electric field at point P is the charge $+q$ distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere.\n*   In our case, the total charge on the outer shell is $+q$. The center of this shell is O. The distance from O to P is $L$.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final expression for the electric field.**\n*   Using Coulomb's law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(Distance from center)}^2}$\n*   Substituting the values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options.**\n*   The derived expression $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ matches option C.\n*   **Careful Point:** The information about the cavity's radius $r$, its offset $s$, the distance $l$ from the cavity's center, and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors. They describe the internal geometry, which is shielded from the external point P by the conductor.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net electric charge is zero.\n\n2.  **Introducing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's law, for the electric field to be zero everywhere within the conducting material, the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be exactly `-q`. This is because if we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conductor and encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface is zero. Therefore, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity (`+q`) and the charge induced on the inner wall (`q_inner`). So, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which gives `q_inner = -q`.\n    This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that its electric field perfectly cancels the electric field of the `+q` charge for all points outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor and beyond). This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral (charge = 0). Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor. This `+q` charge will move to the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    So, `q_conductor = q_inner + q_outer = 0`.\n    `-q + q_outer = 0` => `q_outer = +q`.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that makes the conductor an equipotential volume. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the principle of electrostatic shielding, the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the conductor.\n    Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** The electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's location (`s`), radius (`r`), the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor because of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge that moves to the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the physics involved to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall electrical neutrality, since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner cavity surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conductor shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. This means the charge `+q` on the outer surface distributes itself *uniformly*, regardless of the position of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside. The external electric field is produced only by the charge on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere. This is a consequence of Gauss's Law.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The electric field at point P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface.

The charges on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor are shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity. Conversely, any point outside the conductor is shielded from the direct influence of the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall). The electric field outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on its outer surface.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analyze Charge Induction:**\n*   A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of an initially uncharged spherical conductor.\n*   This positive charge will attract the free electrons (negative charges) within the conductor. These electrons will move towards the `+q` charge and accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n*   To find the total charge induced on this inner surface (`q_inner`), we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field (`E`) inside the bulk of a conductor is always zero.\n*   According to Gauss's Law, the net electric flux (`Î¦_E`) through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge (`Q_enclosed`). Since `E=0` everywhere on our chosen Gaussian surface, the flux `Î¦_E` is zero. This implies that the total charge `Q_enclosed` must also be zero.\n*   The charge enclosed is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `q_inner`. Therefore, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which leads to `q_inner = -q`. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n**2. Analyze Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n*   The conductor as a whole was initially electrically neutral (had a total charge of zero).\n*   Since a charge of `-q` has moved from the bulk of the conductor to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor.\n*   These excess positive charges will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n*   Therefore, a charge of `q_outer = +q` is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**3. Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n*   A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it completely shields its exterior from the electrostatic fields of any charges placed inside it.\n*   The electric field at the point P, which is outside the conductor, is the superposition of the fields from the point charge `+q`, the inner surface charge `-q`, and the outer surface charge `+q`.\n*   The shielding principle tells us that the combined electric field from the charges *inside* the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`) is exactly zero everywhere *outside* the cavity.\n*   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P is produced **solely** by the charge `q_outer = +q` residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n*   We now have a simplified problem: find the electric field at point P due to a charge `+q` distributed on the outer surface of a sphere of radius `R`.\n*   Because the internal charge configuration is shielded and there are no other external fields, the charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n*   So, we can treat the `+q` on the outer surface as a point charge located at the center of the conductor.\n*   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as `L`.\n*   Using the formula for the electric field from a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{distance^2}$\n\n*   Plugging in the values, we get:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge placed inside the cavity (`q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P (`L`). All other information provided in the problem (`r`, `s`, `l`, `Î¸`) describes the geometry of the cavity and the position of the point charge relative to it. This information is irrelevant to the external field due to the powerful principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. A point charge `+q` is placed within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. To achieve this, a total charge of `-q` gets induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this `-q` charge will be non-uniform and will arrange itself to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by `+q` for all points within the conductor and outside of it. This is a key principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The conductor itself acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the charges on the outer surface (`+q`) are completely shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (`+q` point charge and `-q` on the inner surface). As a result, the `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, as if the charges inside the cavity didn't exist. Since the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`, the charge `+q` spreads evenly over this outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the sum of the fields from three sources:\n    *   The point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the shielding effect mentioned in step 2, the net electric field at any point outside the cavity (including point P) from the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is exactly zero.\n\n    Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem, the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is `L`.\n\n    So, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its center's offset `s`, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors intended to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n    *   Comparing our result with the given options, we find that it matches option C.\n\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.

This uses an incorrect distance and ignores the conductor's properties.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-by-step derivation for the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor will attract free electrons from the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a net charge of `-q` on this inner surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, to maintain its overall charge neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere. This positive charge will move to the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface of the conductor are unaffected by the arrangement of charges inside the cavity. Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer conductor, the induced positive charge `+q` will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere (by Shell Theorem or Gauss's Law).\n\n5.  **Calculation:** In this case, the electric field at the external point P is created solely by the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor. Therefore, the field is equivalent to that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n\nUsing Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius `r`, its off-center position `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸` is irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the electrostatic problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge, `+q`, placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge Conservation and Distribution:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the large spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charges on the outer surface are unaffected by the positions of the charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`). Consequently, the `+q` charge on the outer surface distributes itself uniformly, as this is the lowest energy configuration for a spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law and the shell theorem, the electric field at any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The point P is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface. Treating this charge as a point charge located at the center of the large sphere, the magnitude of the electric field at a distance `L` is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe location of the charge inside the cavity (related to distances `l`, `s`, and angle `\\theta$`) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect. Therefore, these parameters are irrelevant to the final answer.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis problem deals with the concept of electrostatic shielding by a conductor.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge +q placed inside the cavity attracts free electrons from the conductor. A total charge of -q accumulates on the inner surface of the cavity to neutralize the field of +q within the conductor's bulk.\n2.  **Charge on Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially uncharged, and a charge of -q has moved to the inner surface, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor isolates the region outside from the region inside the cavity. The electric field outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on its outer surface. The arrangement of the charge inside the cavity and the induced charge on the inner wall does not affect the electric field outside the conductor.\n4.  **Symmetry and Gauss's Law:** Because the outer surface is a sphere, the induced charge +q distributes itself uniformly over this outer surface. This happens regardless of the off-center position of the charge +q inside the cavity. According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at its center.\n5.  **Calculating the Field:** The point P is at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor. The total charge on the outer surface is +q. Therefore, the electric field at P is the same as that of a point charge +q located at the conductor's center. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The parameters related to the cavity's position and size (r, s, l, Î¸) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Distribution**\n    *   We start with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n    *   According to the principles of electrostatics, the free charges within the conductor will rearrange themselves. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract the free electrons in the conductor.\n    *   An amount of charge equal to $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the material of the conductor, enclosing the cavity, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ must be zero everywhere on this surface (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the flux $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$ to be zero, the total charge enclosed by the surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the cavity wall ($q_{inner}$). Thus, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface**\n    *   The conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, if a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor.\n    *   Since charge cannot reside within the bulk of a conductor in equilibrium, this excess positive charge of $+q$ will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge and Electrostatic Shielding**\n    *   The crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding (also known as the Faraday cage effect). The conductor isolates the region outside from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity.\n    *   The charges on the inner surface of the cavity arrange themselves in such a way that their electric field perfectly cancels the electric field of the charge $+q$ for all points *outside the cavity*. Therefore, the field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner wall is zero everywhere within the conducting material and outside the entire conductor.\n    *   As a result, the charges on the outer surface are not influenced by the positions of the charges inside the cavity. The $+q$ charge on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the cavity and its internal charge did not exist.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to achieve the lowest energy configuration.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the $+q$ in the cavity, the $-q$ on the inner surface, and the $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   As established in the previous step, the net electric field from the charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the cavity wall) is zero everywhere outside the cavity. So, their contribution to the field at point P is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the charge $+q$ distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   We have a uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on a spherical surface of radius $R$. According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O. The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. The distance from the center O to the point P is $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The specific details about the cavity's geometry (its radius $r$, its center's offset $s$) and the location of point P relative to the cavity (distance $l$ and angle $\\theta$) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. This information would be necessary to find the field *inside* the cavity but is extraneous for the external field. The conductor perfectly shields the outside from the internal configuration, and the external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the geometry of that outer surface.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts the free electrons within the conductor.

The conducting material ensures that the electric field within the conductor itself is zero. Consequently, the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Distribution:** Due to the spherical shape of the outer conductor, and because there are no other external charges, the induced charge `+q` will spread itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically uniform charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the electric field is equivalent to that of a single point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor.

Analyze the Charge Distribution**\n\n*   **Charge in the Cavity:** A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Inner Surface:** The electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium. To achieve this, the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges to the inner surface of the cavity. By applying Gauss's Law to a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total charge enclosed must be zero. This means a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this charge $-q$ will not be uniform; it will be denser on the side closer to the charge $+q$.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on its outer surface.\n\n**2. Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding**\n\n*   A fundamental property of conductors is that they act as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the conductor (the original charge $+q$ in the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero everywhere outside the conductor.\n*   This means that for a point P located outside the conductor, the electric field generated by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner wall cancel each other out perfectly.\n*   Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**3. Determine the Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface**\n\n*   The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$.\n*   Because the charges inside are perfectly shielded by the conductor itself, they have no influence on how the charge on the outer surface is distributed.\n*   The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will therefore distribute itself uniformly over the spherical surface, as this is the configuration of minimum energy for charges on an isolated spherical conductor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P**\n\n*   Now the problem is reduced to finding the electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge $+q$ and radius $R$.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n*   The center of the spherical conductor is given. The point P is at a distance $L$ from this center.\n*   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{Distance from center})^2}$\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**5. Analysis of Careful Points and Distractor Information**\n\n*   The key principle is electrostatic shielding. The conductor completely isolates the exterior from the interior electrostatic configuration.\n*   The specific location of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity does not matter for the external field.\n*   The position and size of the cavity (given by $s$ and $r$) are also irrelevant for the external field.\n*   The distance $l$ (from P to the cavity's center) and the angle $\\theta$ are distractor variables included to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The only relevant distance for the external field calculation is $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe electric field at the external point P is determined solely by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Its magnitude is as if a point charge $+q$ were located at the conductor's center.\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the cavity is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Gauss's Law and properties of conductors:**\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero.\n    *   Let's consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by $\\epsilon_o$. Since the electric field is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total flux is zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed consists of the point charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, to make the total enclosed charge zero, a charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity wall.\n\n3.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   We've established that a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of the opposite sign must appear somewhere else. This charge, which is $+q$, will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Determine the distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   A key concept in electrostatics is **electrostatic shielding**.

This causes a charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner cavity surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutral charge.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A key principle of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that they create an electrostatic shield. This means two things in this context:\n    *   The electric field inside the conducting material itself is zero. The induced charge `-q` on the cavity surface arranges itself in such a way as to perfectly cancel the electric field from the charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity, including within the conductor's material.\n    *   The charges inside the cavity are shielded from the outside, and crucially, the space outside the conductor is shielded from the exact location and arrangement of charges inside the cavity.\n4.  **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined electric field from the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero for any point outside the cavity.\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the conductor has a spherical outer surface (radius R) and there are no other external charges nearby, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. The location of the cavity and the charge within it do not affect the uniformity of the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect.\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric uniform charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from point P.\n    *   Therefore, the conductor acts like a point charge `+q` located at its center.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other variables, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance from the center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This happens in such a way that the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform because the `+q` charge is not at the center of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors is that they create an \"electrostatic shield.\" The charges on the outer surface are completely unaffected by the arrangement of charges inside the cavity. The conductor effectively isolates the exterior region from the interior region.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external charges nearby, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly.\n\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law (or Shell Theorem):** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell, at any point outside the shell, is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a single point at its center.\n\nTherefore, for point P at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, the electric field is determined only by the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface.

A positive point charge, +q, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge +q inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor, i.e., the wall of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we consider a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero. To make the net charge inside this Gaussian surface zero, a total charge of **-q** must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of **+q** must be left behind on the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, this excess charge will reside on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. This means:\n    *   The charges on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor are shielded from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original +q and the induced -q).\n    *   Conversely, the charges inside the cavity are shielded from any external electric fields.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   Because of electrostatic shielding, the +q charge on the outer surface distributes itself as if the charges inside the cavity do not exist.\n    *   The only factor determining the distribution of this +q charge is the shape of the surface it is on. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge +q will spread out **uniformly** over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges. However, the field created by the charge +q inside the cavity and the induced charge -q on the cavity wall is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is produced *solely* by the uniform distribution of charge +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   A well-known result from Gauss's Law (also known as Newton's Shell Theorem for electrostatics) is that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = +q.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (point O).\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = L.\n    *   Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius (r), its position (s), the distance from the cavity's center to P (l), and the angle (Î¸) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

Analyze the System and Charges\n\n*   We have a spherical conductor of radius $R$. It is initially uncharged.\n*   Inside the conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the cavity is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor.\n*   A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n*   We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor. The distance of P from the center of the conductor is $L$ ($L > R$).\n\n### 2. Apply the Principle of Charge Induction\n\n1.  **Inner Surface:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conductor material, the electric field must be zero (as it is inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Outer Surface:** The conductor was stated to be initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, and charge must be conserved, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. This charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\nSo, the final charge distribution is:\n*   The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n*   An induced charge of $-q$ on the surface of the cavity.\n*   An induced charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n### 3. Use the Property of Electrostatic Shielding\n\nA key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it.\n\n*   The electric field at any point outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all three charge distributions: the charge $+q$ in the cavity, the charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n*   However, a fundamental result from electrostatics (provable by the uniqueness theorem) is that the electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($-q$) exactly cancel each other out everywhere outside the cavity. This combination produces zero electric field in the conductor's bulk and everywhere outside the conductor.\n*   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n### 4. Determine the Field from the Outer Surface Charge\n\n1.  **Charge Distribution:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since this surface is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges inside the cavity and there are no other external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to achieve electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Field of a Uniform Spherical Shell:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere (this is a direct result of Gauss's Law or direct integration).\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is the same as the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe various other distances and angles provided in the problem ($r$, $s$, $l$, $\\theta$) describe the geometry of the cavity and the position of point P relative to the cavity. However, due to the complete electrostatic shielding provided by the conductor, these details are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. The external field only depends on the net charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, ignores the conductor's shielding)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, matches our derivation)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex form irrelevant due to shielding)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex form irrelevant due to shielding)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding (the Faraday cage effect). Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the solution.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract free electrons from the conducting material. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If you imagine a Gaussian surface within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the net electric flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, the charge `+q` inside plus the induced charge on the inner wall must sum to zero, meaning the induced charge is `-q`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of `-q` (in the form of electrons) has moved to the inner surface of the cavity, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This excess charge `+q` will reside on the **outer surface** of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle here is that a closed conducting shell shields the outside world from the electric fields of any charges inside it. The electric field at any point P *outside* the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on the **outer surface** of the conductor. The specific location and arrangement of charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`) have no effect on the field outside.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself to make the conductor's surface an equipotential. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external fields, this charge `+q` will spread out **uniformly** over the surface. The off-center position of the internal cavity is irrelevant to the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect of the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** The problem is now reduced to finding the electric field at a distance `L` from the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell with a total charge of `+q`. According to the Shell Theorem (which can be derived from Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the sphere's center.\n\n*   Total charge creating the external field: `+q`\n*   Location of this effective charge: The center of the large spherical conductor.\n*   Distance from the center to point P: `L`\n\nUsing the formula for the electric field of a point charge:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n\nSubstituting the values from our problem:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nAll the other information given (`r`, `s`, `l`, `Î¸`) is irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor and serves as a distraction to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Charge Distribution**\n\n*   **Charge in the Cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, this charge `+q` will induce a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). To see this, imagine a Gaussian surface completely within the conducting material that encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field (`E`) inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the net electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed must be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    `Q_enclosed = Q_inside_cavity + Q_induced_inner = +q + Q_induced_inner = 0`\n    `=> Q_induced_inner = -q`.\n    The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform to ensure the electric field is cancelled within the conductor.\n\n*   **Induced Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    `Q_conductor_total = Q_induced_inner + Q_induced_outer = -q + Q_induced_outer = 0` (since it was initially neutral).\n    `=> Q_induced_outer = +q`.\n\n**2. The Principle of Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage)**\n\nThe core principle to solve this problem is electrostatic shielding.\n*   The field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero. This field is the superposition of the fields from three sources: (1) the charge `+q` in the cavity, (2) the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, and (3) the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n*   Let's group the first two sources together: the \"cavity system\" (`+q` inside and `-q` on the inner wall). The charge `-q` on the inner wall arranges itself precisely to make the potential on the cavity wall constant. A key result of electrostatics (a consequence of the uniqueness theorem) is that such a system (charges enclosed by an equipotential surface) produces **zero electric field everywhere outside that surface**.\n*   Therefore, the field produced by the \"cavity system\" is zero throughout the conducting material and also at the point P, which is outside the conductor.\n\n**3. Determine the Distribution of the Outer Charge**\n\n*   We established that `E_total = E_cavity_system + E_outer_surface = 0` inside the conductor.\n*   Since `E_cavity_system = 0` inside the conductor (as it's outside the cavity), it must be that `E_outer_surface = 0` inside the conductor as well.\n*   `E_outer_surface` is the electric field produced by the charge `+q` residing on the outer spherical surface. The only way a charge distribution on a spherical shell can produce zero electric field at all points inside it is if the charge is distributed **uniformly** over the surface.\n*   Therefore, the `+q` charge on the outer surface of the conductor is distributed uniformly, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge `+q` inside it.\n\n**4. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P**\n\n*   The total electric field at point P is the sum of the fields from the cavity system and the outer surface charge: `E(P) = E_cavity_system(P) + E_outer_surface(P)`.\n*   As established in step 2, the field from the cavity system is zero outside the cavity: `E_cavity_system(P) = 0`.\n*   Thus, the field at P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor: `E(P) = E_outer_surface(P)`.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law to the outside of the sphere), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n*   In this case, the total charge on the outer shell is `+q`, and its center is the center of the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field from a point charge `q` at a distance `L` is given by Coulomb's Law:\n`E = (1 / 4ÏÎµâ) * (q / LÂ²) `\n\nThis result depends only on the charge `q` placed in the cavity and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.

These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity until they create a total charge of `-q`. This induced negative charge arranges itself on the inner surface to cancel the electric field of `+q` *within the bulk of the conductor*. A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field within its material must be zero.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding (also known as the Faraday cage effect). The conductor isolates the region outside from the region inside the cavity. This means the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the position of the charge `+q` *inside* the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Outer Charge Distribution:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and is isolated, the induced charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over this outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Field:** According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), a uniformly charged spherical shell behaves, for all points outside the shell, as if all its charge were concentrated at its center.\n\nTherefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is created solely by the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This external field is identical to the field that would be produced by a single point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n*E* = (1 / 4ÏÎµâ) * (charge / distanceÂ²)\n\nIn this case, the charge is `q` and the distance from the center of the conductor to point P is `L`. Thus, the magnitude of the electric field is:\n\n*E* = (1 / 4ÏÎµâ) * (q / LÂ²)\n\nThe location of the cavity (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When the positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity, it attracts free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero in a static situation. The charges on the inner surface of the cavity arrange themselves in such a way that their electric field, combined with the field from the charge `+q`, results in a net zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity but within the conductor. This effect is known as electrostatic shielding. It means that the charge distribution on the outer surface is unaffected by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Because the conductor is spherical and there are no other external electric fields, the `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point P outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field produced by a single point charge equal to the total enclosed charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning to find the correct electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the spherical conductor. This causes a negative charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the large spherical conductor to maintain overall neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that the charges on the outer surface are shielded from the configuration of charges inside. The internal charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` combine in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer conductor, and the shielding effect, the induced positive charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the large sphere (radius R). The off-center position of the cavity and the charge within it does not affect the uniformity of the charge on the outer shell.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is distributed symmetrically.\n6.  **Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is the same as the field from a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\nUsing Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, and the angle `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to the principles of electrostatic induction and shielding.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charges and Conductor:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. Its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:**\n    *   The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. An amount of charge equal to $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This is a consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero. For the field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface must be $-q$ to cancel out the $+q$ charge inside.\n    *   Since the conductor was initially neutral, and a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    *   A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it.\n    *   The electric field at any point outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges present:\n        i. The original charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n        ii. The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n        iii. The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   The principle of electrostatic shielding tells us that the net electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the charge present on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   We have a charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Since the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external charges, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer spherical surface. This is because the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to make the potential on the surface constant, which for a sphere happens when the charge distribution is uniform. The configuration inside the cavity is completely shielded and does not influence this distribution.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (which can be derived from Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   This charge acts as if it were a point charge located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of this conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position relative to the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to point P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors to test the understanding of the fundamental principles of electrostatics, specifically charge induction and shielding in conductors.

This causes a negative charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric field of charges inside it. The arrangement of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface ensures that the electric field within the body of the conductor is zero.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the property of electrostatic shielding, the charge `+q` on the outer surface distributes itself uniformly. The external field is produced only by this outer surface charge, and the uniform spherical distribution means it is independent of the position of the charge `+q` within the cavity.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if the entire charge of the shell were concentrated at its center.\n6.  **Calculating the Field:** The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is determined by the total charge on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nThe formula for the electric field of a point charge is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n\nSubstituting the values from our analysis:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, and the angle `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is necessary to ensure the electric field within the bulk of the conductor is zero, as required for electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Analyze Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electrostatic effects of charges placed inside it. The combined electric field produced by the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Calculate the External Electric Field:** An observer at point P, outside the conductor, will only experience the electric field generated by the charge on the outer surface. Because the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external fields, the `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over this surface.\n\n5.  **Apply the Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Formula:** The electric field at point P is therefore equivalent to that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor. Since point P is at a distance `L` from this center, the magnitude of the electric field is given by Coulomb's law:\n    `E = (1 / 4ÏÎµâ) * (q / LÂ²)`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** This matches option D.

Analyze the System and the Effect of Placing the Charge +q**\n\n*   **The Conductor:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero. A conductor has mobile electrons that can redistribute themselves in the presence of an electric field.\n*   **The Cavity:** There is a spherical cavity inside the conductor, which is offset from the center.\n*   **Placing the Charge:** A positive point charge $+q$ is placed *inside* the cavity.\n\n**2. Electrostatic Induction**\n\n*   The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will exert an electric force on the free electrons within the conductor.\n*   Electrons will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge. They will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor, which is the wall of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from the charge $+q$ *inside the bulk of the conductor*, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a surface drawn entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity. Inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ must be zero.\n*   The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must be left behind on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation (Total Charge = $0 = (-q)_{inner} + (+q)_{outer}$).\n\n**3. The Principle of Electrostatic Shielding**\n\n*   A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it completely shields the exterior region from the electrostatic influence of any charges placed inside it.\n*   The combined electric field produced by the original charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n*   Therefore, for any point P *outside* the main spherical conductor, the electric field contribution from the charge in the cavity and the charge on the inner wall is zero.\n\n**4. Calculating the Electric Field at Point P**\n\n*   Since the charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$) produce no field at point P, the only charge that contributes to the field at P is the induced charge $+q$ located on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n*   How is this charge $+q$ distributed on the outer surface? The outer surface is a perfect sphere. Due to the shielding effect of the conductor, the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the non-symmetrical position of the cavity and the charge inside it. The charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to make the conductor an equipotential surface. In the absence of any other external fields, they will distribute themselves perfectly uniformly over the spherical outer surface.\n*   **The Shell Theorem:** For a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n*   In our case, we have a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly on the outer sphere. Point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of this sphere.\n*   Applying the shell theorem, the electric field at P is equivalent to the field of a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The magnitude of the electric field from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law: $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{(distance)^2}$.\n*   The effective charge is $+q$.\n*   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is $L$.\n*   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Careful Points and Distractors**\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The radius of the cavity ($r$), the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to point P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors. They describe the internal geometry, but due to electrostatic shielding, this internal configuration has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n*   **The Key Concepts:** The solution hinges on two crucial concepts:\n    1.  **Charge Induction and Conservation:** Placing a charge inside a neutral conductor induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface and an equal and like charge on the outer surface.\n    2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A conducting shell isolates the exterior from the interior's electric fields.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct formula for the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** To shield the conductor from the electric field of the charge $+q$, a total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface within the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero. Therefore, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero, which means the charge induced on the cavity wall must be exactly $-q$.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Superposition of Electric Fields:** The total electric field at the external point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. In our case, the conducting material acts as a shield. The combined electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is **exactly zero** everywhere outside the cavity. This means these two charge distributions do not contribute to the electric field at point P.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface:** Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$. Because the conducting material shields the outer surface from the charges inside the cavity, the distribution of the $+q$ charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. Since there are no other external charges, the charge $+q$ will spread out **uniformly** over the spherical outer surface due to symmetry.\n\n7.  **Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** The electric field at an external point P, at a distance $L$ from the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge $+q$, is given by the same formula as the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the sphere.\n\n8.  **Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is therefore:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{Q_{total\\_on\\_outer\\_surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The correct answer is based solely on the total charge and the distance from the center of the outer spherical conductor.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis problem involves the principles of electrostatics, specifically concerning conductors and electrostatic shielding.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces charges on the conductor's surfaces. A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity), and a charge of `+q` is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. This is necessary to ensure the electric field within the material of the conductor is zero, a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor effectively isolates the outside region from the electric field created by the charge inside the cavity. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges residing on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined electric field of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity because of the shielding effect of the conductor. Since the outer surface is a sphere, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is uniformly distributed. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the large spherical conductor, will be the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center.\n\nThe magnitude of this electric field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe position of the cavity (`s`), the radius of the cavity (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge +q placed inside the cavity will attract negative charges from the conductor to the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). To completely cancel the electric field within the conducting material, a total charge of -q is induced on this inner surface. Because the charge +q is not at the center of the cavity, this induced charge -q will be distributed non-uniformly on the inner surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The conducting material isolates the outer surface from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (+q) and on the cavity's inner wall (-q). This means the arrangement of charges inside does not influence the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface is a sphere and it is shielded from the internal (and any external) fields, the induced charge +q will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, for the point P located at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, the electric field is determined solely by the +q charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This is equivalent to having a point charge of +q at the center of the large sphere. The complex arrangement inside the cavity (the exact position 's', the distance 'l', the angle 'Î¸') is irrelevant to the field outside due to shielding.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem deals with the principles of electrostatic shielding by a conductor.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, `-q`, on the inner surface of the cavity. This occurs to ensure the electric field within the bulk of the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, to maintain its overall charge neutrality, a positive charge `+q` must appear on its outer surface.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the absence of any other external electric fields, and because the conductor is spherical, this induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the spherical conductor. The arrangement of the charge *inside* the cavity does not affect the distribution of the charge on the *outer* surface. This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding; the conductor isolates the outside region from the influence of the charge inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is the same as the field from a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at a distance `L` from a point charge `q` is given by:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l` (distance from the cavity's center to P), `s` (distance from conductor's center to cavity's center), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and charge placement:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n    *   A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside a cavity within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of charge induction in conductors:**\n    *   An electric field exists inside the cavity due to the charge `+q`.\n    *   However, a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material itself must be zero.\n    *   To achieve this, the free electrons within the conductor rearrange themselves. Negative charges (electrons) are attracted towards the `+q` charge and accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To find the total charge induced on the inner surface, we can imagine a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conducting material. Since the electric field everywhere on this surface is zero, the net electric flux through it is zero. By Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` and the induced charge on the inner surface, `q_inner`.\n    *   Therefore, `q + q_inner = 0`, which means `q_inner = -q`. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. We have established that a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface.\n    *   Due to the law of conservation of charge, a corresponding positive charge must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain its overall initial charge (which was zero). This positive charge moves to the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface, `q_outer`, must be `+q` so that the total charge of the conductor remains `q_inner + q_outer = -q + q = 0`.\n\n4.  **Determine the distribution of the outer surface charge:**\n    *   The charge `+q` is now on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the configuration of charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`).\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field outside the conductor:**\n    *   We need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor.\n    *   The electric field at any point outside a conductor is produced solely by the charges on its outer surface (and any other charges that might be external to the conductor, of which there are none in this problem).\n    *   We have a uniformly distributed charge `+q` on a spherical shell of radius `R`.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.

This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charges and Conductor:** We start with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside a cavity within this conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This creates an induced negative charge on the inner surface. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field `E` inside the conductor's material must be zero.\n    According to Gauss's Law: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the total enclosed charge $Q_{enclosed}$ must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed in the cavity and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$.\n    So, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$.\n    A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface (by moving electrons from other parts of the conductor), a net charge of `+q` must be left behind somewhere else on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. In a conductor, excess charge resides on its surface(s). Therefore, a charge of `+q` will appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges inside it. In our case, the conductor itself acts as this shield. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on the outer surface. The internal charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall are arranged in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero for all points outside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor, which is a sphere of radius R. Since there are no other external electric fields mentioned in the problem, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to be in the lowest energy state (maximum separation).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion on Extra Information:** The information about the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` is all irrelevant to finding the electric field *outside* the conductor. This information would be necessary if one were to calculate the field *inside* the cavity, but for the exterior field, the shielding effect simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n8.  **Comparing with Options:** The derived expression for the electric field is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the System and Charges**: We have a system with three components to consider for the electric field at an external point P:\n    *   The original point charge `+q` placed inside the cavity.\n    *   The charge induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   The charge induced on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface**: The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the wall of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface inside the bulk of the conductor (where the electric field must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium), the net charge enclosed must be zero. Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be `-q` to cancel out the `+q` charge.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface**: The conductor was initially uncharged (total charge = 0). To maintain overall charge neutrality, if a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must be left behind. This excess charge of `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Principle of Electrostatic Shielding**: A fundamental property of a closed conductor is that it acts as a \"Faraday cage.\" It shields the region outside the conductor from the electric fields of any charges inside it. This means that the combined electric field produced by the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero for all points outside the conductor, including point P.\n\n5.  **Field Contribution at Point P**: Due to the shielding effect, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at the external point P is the charge `+q` located on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Field from the Outer Charge Distribution**: Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other charges external to the conductor, the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem**: For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to the field that would be produced by a single point charge with the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   The effective charge creating the field at P is `+q`.\n    *   This charge can be treated as a point charge at the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The other parameters provided (`r`, `s`, `l`, `Î¸`) describe the internal configuration of the cavity and the charge within it. Due to electrostatic shielding, these details are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside it, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors:**\n    *   **Induced Charges:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will polarize the conductor. To understand the effect, consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = 0$). This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero ($Q_{enclosed} = 0$).\n    *   Since the original charge $+q$ is inside the cavity (and thus inside our Gaussian surface), a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to make the total enclosed charge zero. This induced charge $-q$ will not be distributed uniformly on the inner surface; it will be more concentrated on the side closer to the $+q$ charge.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface of the cavity, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding and the Outer Surface:** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electrostatic effects of any charges inside it. The electric field inside the conductor is zero, which means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely independent of the arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$). The $+q$ charge on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the charges inside did not exist.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** For a spherical conductor, the charge on its outer surface will distribute itself uniformly to minimize repulsion, creating a uniform surface charge density. This is the only distribution that ensures the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.\n\n6.  **Calculating the External Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** Now, the problem of finding the electric field at point P outside the conductor simplifies. We only need to consider the field produced by the uniform shell of charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined effect of the charge $+q$ in the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the charge on the outer surface is $+q$, and it's distributed uniformly over a sphere centered at the center of the conductor.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total effective charge producing the field at point P is $+q$.\n    *   This effective charge is located at the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The detailed information about the cavity's position ($s$), its radius ($r$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor, due to the shielding effect.

Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface.\n2.  **Charge Neutrality:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall charge neutrality, since a `-q` charge has been induced on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges placed inside it. The conductor prevents the electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface from reaching the region outside the conductor.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical shape of the conductor and the shielding effect, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (this is a result from Gauss's Law). Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n6.  **Calculating the Magnitude:** The distance from the center of the spherical conductor to point P is given as `L`. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The variables `l`, `s`, and `Î¸` which describe the position of the cavity and the point P relative to the cavity are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, option D matches the derived expression.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the spherical cavity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). To maintain its overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear somewhere else on the conductor. In a conductor, charges are free to move and will reside on the surface. Thus, a charge of `+q` is induced on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. The electric field inside the conducting material is zero. For any point outside the conductor, the electric field is solely determined by the charge distribution on the outer surface. The arrangement of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface has no net effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface of the conductor, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this surface. This happens regardless of the shape or position of the cavity inside.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a single point at its center.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** In this problem, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is distributed uniformly on a sphere of radius `R` centered at the conductor's center.

The combined electric field at any point outside the conductor due to the original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's inner wall is zero.\n4.  **Field due to Outer Charge:** Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the conductor is solely due to the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n5.  **Symmetry and Charge Distribution:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.

Inside this conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the conductor is $O_c$ and the center of the cavity is $O_v$. The distance between these centers is $s$. A point charge $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. The distance of P from the conductor's center $O_c$ is $L$, and its distance from the cavity's center $O_v$ is $l$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity (Charge Induction)**\n1.  The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  To determine the amount of induced charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n3.  A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n4.  According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through our Gaussian surface is zero, which implies that the net charge enclosed by this surface must be zero.\n5.  The net charge enclosed is the sum of the point charge $+q$ and the induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity, $q_{inner}$.\n6.  Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which means $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the charge on the outer surface of the conductor**\n1.  The conductor was initially uncharged, meaning its net charge was zero.\n2.  Charge is conserved. The total charge of the conductor must remain zero. The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$).\n3.  So, $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n4.  Substituting the value of $q_{inner}$ from Step 2, we get $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n5.  This implies that $q_{outer} = +q$. A total charge of $+q$ must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the principle of electrostatic shielding**\n1.  A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. A closed conducting shell (like our spherical conductor) shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it.\n2.  This means that the distribution of the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity or the off-center position of the cavity itself.\n3.  The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the inner charges were not there. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges, this charge $+q$ will spread out uniformly over the surface.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the electric field outside the conductor**\n1.  The electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field produced by a single point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the shell.\n2.  In our case, the outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$ centered at $O_c$. It has a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly.\n3.  The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, $O_c$.\n4.  Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n5.  Substituting $q_{outer} = +q$, we get:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **The conductor is a shield:** The key principle is that the conducting material shields the outside from the inside. The only information that \"gets out\" is the net charge that is forced onto the outer surface.\n*   **Irrelevant information:** The specific location of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity, the radius of the cavity $r$, the distance between centers $s$, the distance from the cavity center $l$, and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided to potentially distract or test the understanding of the shielding principle. These parameters would be necessary if we were asked to find the field *inside* the cavity.\n*   **Symmetry of the outer surface:** The problem is simplified because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere. This allows the induced charge $+q$ to distribute uniformly, leading to a simple $1/L^2$ field. If the conductor were not spherical, the charge on the outer surface would not be uniform, and the external field would be more complex to calculate, but it would still be independent of the details of the cavity's interior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is determined solely by the charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity:**\n    The positive charge $+q$ is placed inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. Conductors contain mobile charges (electrons) that will redistribute themselves in the presence of an electric field. The $+q$ charge will attract the mobile electrons in the conductor.\n\n2.  **Induced charge on the inner surface:**\n    The electrons in the conductor will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge and will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. This creates a net negative charge on the inner surface. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law.\n    Consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the bulk of the conductor, enclosing the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of a conductor must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this closed surface is proportional to the net charge enclosed: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed, $q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    $q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Induced charge on the outer surface:**\n    The problem states that the spherical conductor was initially uncharged. The conductor as a whole must remain electrically neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface (by moving from other parts of the conductor), a net charge of $+q$ must be left behind on the conductor. These positive charges (which are actually the atomic nuclei left behind by the mobile electrons) will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n    So, a charge of $q_{outer} = +q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor produce zero electric field inside the conductor. Conversely, the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner surface) produce a net zero electric field everywhere *outside* the cavity.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is caused *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor. The internal configuration (the charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$) does not contribute to the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since the conductor is an equipotential volume in equilibrium, and the outer surface is spherical, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. The non-uniformity of the fields inside the cavity does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    According to the shell theorem (which is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. They are extraneous information intended to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P ($L$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, the accumulation of `-q` on the inner surface leaves a net positive charge of `+q` on the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, this excess charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The charges on the inner surface of the cavity (`-q`) and the charge `+q` inside the cavity arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is cancelled out within the conducting material itself. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the specific location (`s`, `r`, `l`, `Î¸`) of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n4.  **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced solely by the charge distributed on the outer surface. Because the outer surface is a sphere of radius `R`, the induced charge `+q` will spread uniformly over this surface.\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law (or Shell Theorem):** For a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge equal to the total charge of the sphere, located at its center.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, `r`, and the angle `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, `-q`, on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law, which states that the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). To maintain its overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to balance the `-q` induced on the inner surface.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the cavity (the original `+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) have no effect on the electric field outside the conductor. The electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the shielding effect, the `+q` charge on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the charge `+q` or the cavity inside. Because the conductor is a sphere, this outer charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field can be calculated as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. In this case, the uniformly distributed `+q` on the outer surface creates an electric field at point P as if it were a point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.

This means that the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is completely independent of the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Charge Distribution:** Due to the symmetrical shape of the outer surface (a sphere), the induced charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over this surface to minimize potential energy.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), for any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the point P is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface.

A positive charge `+q` is placed within this cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. According to Gauss's Law, if we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to cancel out the `+q` charge.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface of the cavity, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.

This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to the principles of electrostatics, a charge inside a cavity of a conductor will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of that cavity. This happens to ensure that the electric field inside the conducting material itself is zero. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the spherical cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface from the conductor's free electrons, a net positive charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface of the conductor are shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (the original charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface). Consequently, the distribution of the $+q$ charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the outer surface of the conductor is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the internal charges, the $+q$ charge will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, let's call it $q_{inner}$.\n    *   Therefore, we have the equation: $+q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   Solving for the induced charge on the inner surface gives $q_{inner} = -q$. This charge `-q` will distribute itself non-uniformly on the inner surface to ensure the electric field is zero within the conductor.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface.** The conductor was initially neutral. By the law of conservation of charge, if a charge of `-q` has moved from the bulk of the conductor to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind. In a conductor, any net charge resides on its outermost surface. Therefore, a charge of $q_{outer} = +q$ will appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the Outer Surface Charge (Electrostatic Shielding).** This is the most critical step. The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield (a Faraday cage). It completely isolates the region outside the conductor from the electric fields of the charges located inside the cavity. The combined electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero for all points outside the conductor.\n    *   Because of this shielding, the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Electric Field at the External Point P.** The total electric field at point P is the vector sum of the fields from all charges: (1) the charge `+q` in the cavity, (2) the charge `-q` on the inner surface, and (3) the charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n    *   As established by the shielding principle, the combined electric field from the charges inside (source 1 and 2) is zero at point P.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *only* by the charge `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Apply the Shell Theorem.** The Shell Theorem (a result derived from Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this surface is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as `L`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation.** Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    Substituting our values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's position (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`\\theta`) are all distractors. The physics of electrostatic shielding simplifies the problem, making the external field dependent only on the total induced charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We begin with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the total charge on the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge `+q`:** A positive charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field (`E`) inside the material of a conductor must be zero.\n    *   Gauss's Law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since `E = 0` everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the total flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity (`+q`) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This gives us $q_{inner} = -q$. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this charge might be non-uniform, depending on the exact location of `+q` inside the cavity, but the total amount is fixed at `-q`.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. These positive charges will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n    *   So, a charge of $q_{outer} = +q$ appears on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Shielding Effect (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. The charges on the conductor rearrange themselves to ensure this. The field produced by the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is completely cancelled outside the cavity by the conductor. Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the net electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero.\n\n6.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges inside the cavity. From the perspective of the charges on the outer surface, they are simply on a spherical conductor. To achieve electrostatic equilibrium (the lowest energy state), these charges will spread out uniformly over the spherical outer surface of radius `R`.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The total electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields from all charges.\n    *   $\\vec{E}_P = \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q in cavity})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from -q on inner surface})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q on outer surface})}$\n    *   As established by the shielding principle, the first two terms sum to zero for any point outside the conductor: $\\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q in cavity})} + \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from -q on inner surface})} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the field at P is solely due to the charge `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer surface: $\\vec{E}_P = \\vec{E}_{(\\text{from +q on outer surface})}$.\n\n8.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** The shell theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law) states that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   We have a total charge of `+q` uniformly distributed on the outer sphere of radius `R`, centered at O.\n    *   Point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n    *   The magnitude of the electric field at P is therefore the same as that of a point charge `+q` at O.\n    *   $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The specific details about the cavity's location (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from P to the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are extraneous information intended to distract.

These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a net charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially electrically neutral, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q` on the inner wall) do not produce an electric field outside the conductor. Similarly, the charge on the outer surface does not create a field inside the conductor's material.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges within the cavity, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (a principle derived from Gauss's Law, also known as the Shell Theorem).\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. This charge is uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius `R` centered at `O`. The electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center `O`, is therefore calculated as if a point charge `+q` were located at `O`.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information regarding the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance from P to the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` is all extraneous information designed to be a distraction, as the principle of electrostatic shielding makes them irrelevant to the field outside the conductor.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the neutral spherical conductor, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. This causes a negative charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the accumulation of `-q` on the inner surface leaves a net positive charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero. This means the charges on the outer surface are \"shielded\" from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface. Consequently, the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge or the cavity inside.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over this surface to minimize potential energy.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n6.  **Calculating the Field at Point P:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor.

The location of the charge `+q` inside the cavity does not affect the distribution of charge on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will spread out uniformly. Because the conductor is a sphere and is isolated, the charge distribution on its outer surface will be spherically symmetric, regardless of the shape or position of the cavity inside.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point P outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.

This charge $-q$ will distribute itself non-uniformly on the cavity wall to cancel the field of the $+q$ charge within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged, so its net charge is zero.\n    *   The total charge of the conductor is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($Q_{outer}$).\n    *   Total Charge = $Q_{inner} + Q_{outer} = 0$\n    *   Substituting $Q_{inner} = -q$, we get:\n    *   $-q + Q_{outer} = 0 \\implies Q_{outer} = +q$.\n    *   So, a charge of $+q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    *   A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface arranges itself in such a way that the combined electric field of the point charge $+q$ and the inner surface charge $-q$ is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the electric field contribution from the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner wall ($-q$) is zero.\n\n4.  **Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields from all charges.

The combined electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Field at Point P:** Consequently, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is caused *only* by the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Symmetry and Gauss's Law:** Since the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the induced charge `+q` distributes itself uniformly over this surface. According to Gauss's law (and the shell theorem), for any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.

Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding. The conductor effectively isolates the region outside it from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface.\n4.  **Field from the Outer Charge:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor will distribute itself uniformly over that surface. This is because the outer surface is a sphere, and in the absence of other external charges, the distribution will be symmetric.\n5.  **Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` at O, which is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters like `r`, `s`, `l`, and `Î¸` describe the internal geometry but do not affect the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.

Let's call its center O and its radius R.\n*   Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity. Let's call its center C and its radius r. The distance between O and C is $s$.\n*   A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n*   We need to find the electric field at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The distance from the conductor's center O to P is $L$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors.**\n*   **Charge Induction:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will move and accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). To completely cancel the electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the bulk of the conductor material, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n*   **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. Since charges in a conductor can only reside on its surfaces, this $+q$ charge will spread out over the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the charge distribution on the outer surface.**\n*   We now have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   The outer surface is a perfect sphere of radius $R$.\n*   A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the charge on its surface will arrange itself to make the conductor an equipotential volume. In the absence of any external electric fields, the most symmetric distribution is the most stable. Therefore, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself *uniformly* over the spherical outer surface.\n*   **Careful Point:** The position of the cavity and the charge inside it are irregular and non-symmetric with respect to the center O. However, this does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface. The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. The field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero, effectively isolating the \"inside world\" (the cavity) from the \"outside world\". The only thing the outside world \"knows\" is that a total charge of $+q$ has appeared on the outer surface.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the electric field at point P.**\n*   The electric field at the external point P is the result of all charges in the system. By the principle of superposition, this is the sum of the fields from:\n    1.  The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    2.  The induced charge $-q$ on the inner cavity surface.\n    3.  The induced charge $+q$ on the outer conductor surface.\n*   **Key Concept (Shell Theorem / Gauss's Law):** The electric field produced by the charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the cavity wall) is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. The conductor shields the external point P from these internal charges.\n*   Therefore, the only source that contributes to the electric field at point P is the charge $+q$ distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge equal to the total charge on the shell, located at the center of the sphere.\n*   In our case, the total charge on the outer shell is $+q$. The center of this shell is O. The distance from O to P is $L$.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final expression for the electric field.**\n*   Using Coulomb's law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(Distance from center)}^2}$\n*   Substituting the values:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options.**\n*   The derived expression $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ matches option C.\n*   **Careful Point:** The information about the cavity's radius $r$, its offset $s$, the distance $l$ from the cavity's center, and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors.

This means its net electric charge is zero.\n\n2.  **Introducing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's law, for the electric field to be zero everywhere within the conducting material, the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be exactly `-q`. This is because if we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conductor and encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface is zero. Therefore, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity (`+q`) and the charge induced on the inner wall (`q_inner`). So, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which gives `q_inner = -q`.\n    This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that its electric field perfectly cancels the electric field of the `+q` charge for all points outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor and beyond). This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral (charge = 0). Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor. This `+q` charge will move to the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    So, `q_conductor = q_inner + q_outer = 0`.\n    `-q + q_outer = 0` => `q_outer = +q`.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that makes the conductor an equipotential volume. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the principle of electrostatic shielding, the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the conductor.\n    Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** The electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's location (`s`), radius (`r`), the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor because of electrostatic shielding.

These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall electrical neutrality, since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner cavity surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conductor shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. This means the charge `+q` on the outer surface distributes itself *uniformly*, regardless of the position of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside. The external electric field is produced only by the charge on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere. This is a consequence of Gauss's Law.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The electric field at point P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analyze Charge Induction:**\n*   A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of an initially uncharged spherical conductor.\n*   This positive charge will attract the free electrons (negative charges) within the conductor. These electrons will move towards the `+q` charge and accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n*   To find the total charge induced on this inner surface (`q_inner`), we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field (`E`) inside the bulk of a conductor is always zero.\n*   According to Gauss's Law, the net electric flux (`Î¦_E`) through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge (`Q_enclosed`). Since `E=0` everywhere on our chosen Gaussian surface, the flux `Î¦_E` is zero. This implies that the total charge `Q_enclosed` must also be zero.\n*   The charge enclosed is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `q_inner`. Therefore, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which leads to `q_inner = -q`. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n**2. Analyze Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n*   The conductor as a whole was initially electrically neutral (had a total charge of zero).\n*   Since a charge of `-q` has moved from the bulk of the conductor to the inner surface, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor.\n*   These excess positive charges will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n*   Therefore, a charge of `q_outer = +q` is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**3. Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n*   A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it completely shields its exterior from the electrostatic fields of any charges placed inside it.\n*   The electric field at the point P, which is outside the conductor, is the superposition of the fields from the point charge `+q`, the inner surface charge `-q`, and the outer surface charge `+q`.\n*   The shielding principle tells us that the combined electric field from the charges *inside* the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`) is exactly zero everywhere *outside* the cavity.\n*   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P is produced **solely** by the charge `q_outer = +q` residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P:**\n*   We now have a simplified problem: find the electric field at point P due to a charge `+q` distributed on the outer surface of a sphere of radius `R`.\n*   Because the internal charge configuration is shielded and there are no other external fields, the charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n*   So, we can treat the `+q` on the outer surface as a point charge located at the center of the conductor.\n*   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as `L`.\n*   Using the formula for the electric field from a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{distance^2}$\n\n*   Plugging in the values, we get:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge placed inside the cavity (`q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P (`L`). All other information provided in the problem (`r`, `s`, `l`, `Î¸`) describes the geometry of the cavity and the position of the point charge relative to it. This information is irrelevant to the external field due to the powerful principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. A point charge `+q` is placed within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. To achieve this, a total charge of `-q` gets induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this `-q` charge will be non-uniform and will arrange itself to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by `+q` for all points within the conductor and outside of it. This is a key principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The conductor itself acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the charges on the outer surface (`+q`) are completely shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (`+q` point charge and `-q` on the inner surface). As a result, the `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, as if the charges inside the cavity didn't exist. Since the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`, the charge `+q` spreads evenly over this outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the sum of the fields from three sources:\n    *   The point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the shielding effect mentioned in step 2, the net electric field at any point outside the cavity (including point P) from the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is exactly zero.\n\n    Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem, the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is `L`.\n\n    So, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its center's offset `s`, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

To maintain its overall neutrality, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the large spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charges on the outer surface are unaffected by the positions of the charges inside the conductor (the original `+q` and the induced `-q`). Consequently, the `+q` charge on the outer surface distributes itself uniformly, as this is the lowest energy configuration for a spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law and the shell theorem, the electric field at any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The point P is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface.

A total charge of -q accumulates on the inner surface of the cavity to neutralize the field of +q within the conductor's bulk.\n2.  **Charge on Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially uncharged, and a charge of -q has moved to the inner surface, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor isolates the region outside from the region inside the cavity. The electric field outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on its outer surface. The arrangement of the charge inside the cavity and the induced charge on the inner wall does not affect the electric field outside the conductor.\n4.  **Symmetry and Gauss's Law:** Because the outer surface is a sphere, the induced charge +q distributes itself uniformly over this outer surface. This happens regardless of the off-center position of the charge +q inside the cavity. According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at its center.\n5.  **Calculating the Field:** The point P is at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor. The total charge on the outer surface is +q. Therefore, the electric field at P is the same as that of a point charge +q located at the conductor's center. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The parameters related to the cavity's position and size (r, s, l, Î¸) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Distribution**\n    *   We start with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n    *   A positive charge $+q$ is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n    *   According to the principles of electrostatics, the free charges within the conductor will rearrange themselves. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract the free electrons in the conductor.\n    *   An amount of charge equal to $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the material of the conductor, enclosing the cavity, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ must be zero everywhere on this surface (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the flux $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$ to be zero, the total charge enclosed by the surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the cavity wall ($q_{inner}$). Thus, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface**\n    *   The conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall neutrality, if a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor.\n    *   Since charge cannot reside within the bulk of a conductor in equilibrium, this excess positive charge of $+q$ will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Distribution of the Outer Charge and Electrostatic Shielding**\n    *   The crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding (also known as the Faraday cage effect). The conductor isolates the region outside from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity.\n    *   The charges on the inner surface of the cavity arrange themselves in such a way that their electric field perfectly cancels the electric field of the charge $+q$ for all points *outside the cavity*. Therefore, the field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner wall is zero everywhere within the conducting material and outside the entire conductor.\n    *   As a result, the charges on the outer surface are not influenced by the positions of the charges inside the cavity. The $+q$ charge on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the cavity and its internal charge did not exist.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to achieve the lowest energy configuration.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges: the $+q$ in the cavity, the $-q$ on the inner surface, and the $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   As established in the previous step, the net electric field from the charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the cavity wall) is zero everywhere outside the cavity. So, their contribution to the field at point P is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the charge $+q$ distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   We have a uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on a spherical surface of radius $R$. According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O. The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. The distance from the center O to the point P is $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The specific details about the cavity's geometry (its radius $r$, its center's offset $s$) and the location of point P relative to the cavity (distance $l$ and angle $\\theta$) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. This information would be necessary to find the field *inside* the cavity but is extraneous for the external field. The conductor perfectly shields the outside from the internal configuration, and the external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the geometry of that outer surface.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a net charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conductor shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. The conducting material ensures that the electric field within the conductor itself is zero. Consequently, the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Distribution:** Due to the spherical shape of the outer conductor, and because there are no other external charges, the induced charge `+q` will spread itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically uniform charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the electric field is equivalent to that of a single point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.

A charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity. We need to find the electric field `E` at a point `P` *outside* the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Principles of Electrostatics for Conductors:**\n    *   **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges. Since the conductor has free electrons, a total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   **Charge Conservation:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear somewhere else. In a conductor, excess charge resides on the outer surface. So, a charge of `+q` will be induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The combined electric field at any point outside the cavity, due to the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's inner wall, is exactly zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Source of the External Field:**\n    *   Based on the shielding principle, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P (outside the conductor) is the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   The details of the cavity's position (`s`), the exact location of the charge `+q` inside the cavity, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` are all irrelevant for calculating the field *outside* the conductor, due to this shielding effect.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Field from the Outer Surface Charge:**\n    *   The induced charge `+q` is distributed on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges to influence it, this charge `+q` will distribute itself *uniformly* over the surface.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge of `+q` on the outer spherical surface. The center of this sphere is the center of the conductor. The point P is at a distance `L` from this center.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Final Equation:**\n    *   The electric field `E` at point P is therefore the field of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor, at a distance `L`.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law, the magnitude of this field is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This perfectly matches our derived result.\n    *   B), C), D) are incorrect because they depend on `l`, `s`, or `\\theta`, which are details inside the shielded region and do not affect the external field.\n\n7.  **Construct the Python Code:** The task is to select the correct option.

Analyze the Charge Distribution**\n\n*   **Charge in the Cavity:** A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Inner Surface:** The electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium. To achieve this, the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges to the inner surface of the cavity. By applying Gauss's Law to a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total charge enclosed must be zero. This means a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this charge $-q$ will not be uniform; it will be denser on the side closer to the charge $+q$.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on its outer surface.\n\n**2. Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding**\n\n*   A fundamental property of conductors is that they act as an electrostatic shield. The charges inside the conductor (the original charge $+q$ in the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero everywhere outside the conductor.\n*   This means that for a point P located outside the conductor, the electric field generated by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner wall cancel each other out perfectly.\n*   Therefore, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the charge $+q$ residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n**3. Determine the Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface**\n\n*   The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$.\n*   Because the charges inside are perfectly shielded by the conductor itself, they have no influence on how the charge on the outer surface is distributed.\n*   The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will therefore distribute itself uniformly over the spherical surface, as this is the configuration of minimum energy for charges on an isolated spherical conductor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P**\n\n*   Now the problem is reduced to finding the electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge $+q$ and radius $R$.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n*   The center of the spherical conductor is given. The point P is at a distance $L$ from this center.\n*   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{Distance from center})^2}$\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**5. Analysis of Careful Points and Distractor Information**\n\n*   The key principle is electrostatic shielding. The conductor completely isolates the exterior from the interior electrostatic configuration.\n*   The specific location of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity does not matter for the external field.\n*   The position and size of the cavity (given by $s$ and $r$) are also irrelevant for the external field.\n*   The distance $l$ (from P to the cavity's center) and the angle $\\theta$ are distractor variables included to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The only relevant distance for the external field calculation is $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe electric field at the external point P is determined solely by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Its magnitude is as if a point charge $+q$ were located at the conductor's center.\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the cavity is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Gauss's Law and properties of conductors:**\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero.\n    *   Let's consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by $\\epsilon_o$. Since the electric field is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface (as it's inside the conductor), the total flux is zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed consists of the point charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, to make the total enclosed charge zero, a charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity wall.\n\n3.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   We've established that a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of the opposite sign must appear somewhere else. This charge, which is $+q$, will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Determine the distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   A key concept in electrostatics is **electrostatic shielding**. The conducting material shields the outer surface from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q).\n    *   Therefore, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. It behaves as if it's the only charge present on an isolated spherical conductor.\n    *   For a spherical conductor, any net charge on it will distribute itself uniformly over its outer surface to minimize repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field outside the conductor:**\n    *   The electric field at the external point P is the superposition of the fields created by all charges: the point charge $+q$, the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   Due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge $-q$ on the cavity wall is zero for all points outside the conductor.\n    *   Thus, the only charge distribution that contributes to the electric field at point P is the uniform charge distribution of $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion and choice of answer:**\n    *   The result shows that the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. All other parameters, such as the cavity's radius $r$, its offset $s$, the distance $l$, and the angle $\\theta$, are irrelevant for calculating the external field. They are distractor variables.\n    *   Comparing our derived formula with the given options, we find that option B matches perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. This causes a charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner cavity surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutral charge.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A key principle of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that they create an electrostatic shield. This means two things in this context:\n    *   The electric field inside the conducting material itself is zero. The induced charge `-q` on the cavity surface arranges itself in such a way as to perfectly cancel the electric field from the charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity, including within the conductor's material.\n    *   The charges inside the cavity are shielded from the outside, and crucially, the space outside the conductor is shielded from the exact location and arrangement of charges inside the cavity.\n4.  **Field Outside the Conductor:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined electric field from the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero for any point outside the cavity.\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the conductor has a spherical outer surface (radius R) and there are no other external charges nearby, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. The location of the cavity and the charge within it do not affect the uniformity of the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect.\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric uniform charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from point P.\n    *   Therefore, the conductor acts like a point charge `+q` located at its center.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other variables, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance from the center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This happens in such a way that the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero. The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform because the `+q` charge is not at the center of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors is that they create an \"electrostatic shield.\" The charges on the outer surface are completely unaffected by the arrangement of charges inside the cavity. The conductor effectively isolates the exterior region from the interior region.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and there are no other external charges nearby, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly.\n\n5.  **Applying Gauss's Law (or Shell Theorem):** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell, at any point outside the shell, is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a single point at its center.\n\nTherefore, for point P at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, the electric field is determined only by the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface.

A positive point charge, +q, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:**\n    *   The positive charge +q inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor, i.e., the wall of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we consider a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero. To make the net charge inside this Gaussian surface zero, a total charge of **-q** must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface, a corresponding charge of **+q** must be left behind on the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, this excess charge will reside on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. This means:\n    *   The charges on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor are shielded from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original +q and the induced -q).\n    *   Conversely, the charges inside the cavity are shielded from any external electric fields.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   Because of electrostatic shielding, the +q charge on the outer surface distributes itself as if the charges inside the cavity do not exist.\n    *   The only factor determining the distribution of this +q charge is the shape of the surface it is on. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge +q will spread out **uniformly** over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges. However, the field created by the charge +q inside the cavity and the induced charge -q on the cavity wall is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is produced *solely* by the uniform distribution of charge +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   A well-known result from Gauss's Law (also known as Newton's Shell Theorem for electrostatics) is that the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = +q.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (point O).\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = L.\n    *   Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius (r), its position (s), the distance from the cavity's center to P (l), and the angle (Î¸) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor.

Analyze the System and Charges\n\n*   We have a spherical conductor of radius $R$. It is initially uncharged.\n*   Inside the conductor, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the cavity is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor.\n*   A point charge of $+q$ is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n*   We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor. The distance of P from the center of the conductor is $L$ ($L > R$).\n\n### 2. Apply the Principle of Charge Induction\n\n1.  **Inner Surface:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conductor material, the electric field must be zero (as it is inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). This implies that the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Outer Surface:** The conductor was stated to be initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, and charge must be conserved, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor. This charge will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n\nSo, the final charge distribution is:\n*   The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n*   An induced charge of $-q$ on the surface of the cavity.\n*   An induced charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n### 3. Use the Property of Electrostatic Shielding\n\nA key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it.\n\n*   The electric field at any point outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all three charge distributions: the charge $+q$ in the cavity, the charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n*   However, a fundamental result from electrostatics (provable by the uniqueness theorem) is that the electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the induced charge on the inner surface ($-q$) exactly cancel each other out everywhere outside the cavity. This combination produces zero electric field in the conductor's bulk and everywhere outside the conductor.\n*   Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge residing on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n### 4. Determine the Field from the Outer Surface Charge\n\n1.  **Charge Distribution:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since this surface is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of charges inside the cavity and there are no other external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to achieve electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Field of a Uniform Spherical Shell:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere (this is a direct result of Gauss's Law or direct integration).\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of this spherical surface is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is the same as the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe various other distances and angles provided in the problem ($r$, $s$, $l$, $\\theta$) describe the geometry of the cavity and the position of point P relative to the cavity. However, due to the complete electrostatic shielding provided by the conductor, these details are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. The external field only depends on the net charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, ignores the conductor's shielding)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, matches our derivation)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex form irrelevant due to shielding)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect, complex form irrelevant due to shielding)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding (the Faraday cage effect). Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the solution.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract free electrons from the conducting material. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If you imagine a Gaussian surface within the material of the conductor that encloses the cavity, the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. For the net electric flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, the charge `+q` inside plus the induced charge on the inner wall must sum to zero, meaning the induced charge is `-q`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of `-q` (in the form of electrons) has moved to the inner surface of the cavity, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This excess charge `+q` will reside on the **outer surface** of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle here is that a closed conducting shell shields the outside world from the electric fields of any charges inside it. The electric field at any point P *outside* the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on the **outer surface** of the conductor. The specific location and arrangement of charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`) have no effect on the field outside.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself to make the conductor's surface an equipotential. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external fields, this charge `+q` will spread out **uniformly** over the surface. The off-center position of the internal cavity is irrelevant to the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect of the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** The problem is now reduced to finding the electric field at a distance `L` from the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell with a total charge of `+q`. According to the Shell Theorem (which can be derived from Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the sphere's center.\n\n*   Total charge creating the external field: `+q`\n*   Location of this effective charge: The center of the large spherical conductor.\n*   Distance from the center to point P: `L`\n\nUsing the formula for the electric field of a point charge:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n\nSubstituting the values from our problem:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nAll the other information given (`r`, `s`, `l`, `Î¸`) is irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor and serves as a distraction to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Charge Distribution**\n\n*   **Charge in the Cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n*   **Induced Charge on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, this charge `+q` will induce a negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). To see this, imagine a Gaussian surface completely within the conducting material that encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field (`E`) inside the conductor must be zero. Therefore, the net electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed must be zero. Since there is a charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    `Q_enclosed = Q_inside_cavity + Q_induced_inner = +q + Q_induced_inner = 0`\n    `=> Q_induced_inner = -q`.\n    The distribution of this `-q` charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform to ensure the electric field is cancelled within the conductor.\n\n*   **Induced Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    `Q_conductor_total = Q_induced_inner + Q_induced_outer = -q + Q_induced_outer = 0` (since it was initially neutral).\n    `=> Q_induced_outer = +q`.\n\n**2. The Principle of Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage)**\n\nThe core principle to solve this problem is electrostatic shielding.\n*   The field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero. This field is the superposition of the fields from three sources: (1) the charge `+q` in the cavity, (2) the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, and (3) the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n*   Let's group the first two sources together: the \"cavity system\" (`+q` inside and `-q` on the inner wall). The charge `-q` on the inner wall arranges itself precisely to make the potential on the cavity wall constant. A key result of electrostatics (a consequence of the uniqueness theorem) is that such a system (charges enclosed by an equipotential surface) produces **zero electric field everywhere outside that surface**.\n*   Therefore, the field produced by the \"cavity system\" is zero throughout the conducting material and also at the point P, which is outside the conductor.\n\n**3. Determine the Distribution of the Outer Charge**\n\n*   We established that `E_total = E_cavity_system + E_outer_surface = 0` inside the conductor.\n*   Since `E_cavity_system = 0` inside the conductor (as it's outside the cavity), it must be that `E_outer_surface = 0` inside the conductor as well.\n*   `E_outer_surface` is the electric field produced by the charge `+q` residing on the outer spherical surface. The only way a charge distribution on a spherical shell can produce zero electric field at all points inside it is if the charge is distributed **uniformly** over the surface.\n*   Therefore, the `+q` charge on the outer surface of the conductor is distributed uniformly, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge `+q` inside it.\n\n**4. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P**\n\n*   The total electric field at point P is the sum of the fields from the cavity system and the outer surface charge: `E(P) = E_cavity_system(P) + E_outer_surface(P)`.\n*   As established in step 2, the field from the cavity system is zero outside the cavity: `E_cavity_system(P) = 0`.\n*   Thus, the field at P is solely due to the uniform distribution of charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor: `E(P) = E_outer_surface(P)`.\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law to the outside of the sphere), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n*   In this case, the total charge on the outer shell is `+q`, and its center is the center of the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field from a point charge `q` at a distance `L` is given by Coulomb's Law:\n`E = (1 / 4ÏÎµâ) * (q / LÂ²) `\n\nThis result depends only on the charge `q` placed in the cavity and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.

These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity until they create a total charge of `-q`. This induced negative charge arranges itself on the inner surface to cancel the electric field of `+q` *within the bulk of the conductor*. A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field within its material must be zero.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding (also known as the Faraday cage effect). The conductor isolates the region outside from the region inside the cavity. This means the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the position of the charge `+q` *inside* the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Outer Charge Distribution:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere and is isolated, the induced charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over this outer surface to minimize electrostatic potential energy.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Field:** According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), a uniformly charged spherical shell behaves, for all points outside the shell, as if all its charge were concentrated at its center.\n\nTherefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is created solely by the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This external field is identical to the field that would be produced by a single point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n*E* = (1 / 4ÏÎµâ) * (charge / distanceÂ²)\n\nIn this case, the charge is `q` and the distance from the center of the conductor to point P is `L`.

To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero in a static situation. The charges on the inner surface of the cavity arrange themselves in such a way that their electric field, combined with the field from the charge `+q`, results in a net zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity but within the conductor. This effect is known as electrostatic shielding. It means that the charge distribution on the outer surface is unaffected by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Because the conductor is spherical and there are no other external electric fields, the `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point P outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field produced by a single point charge equal to the total enclosed charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.

The internal charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` combine in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer conductor, and the shielding effect, the induced positive charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the large sphere (radius R). The off-center position of the cavity and the charge within it does not affect the uniformity of the charge on the outer shell.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is distributed symmetrically.\n6.  **Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is the same as the field from a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\nUsing Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, and the angle `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to the principles of electrostatic induction and shielding.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charges and Conductor:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor.

Analyze the System and the Effect of Placing the Charge +q**\n\n*   **The Conductor:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero. A conductor has mobile electrons that can redistribute themselves in the presence of an electric field.\n*   **The Cavity:** There is a spherical cavity inside the conductor, which is offset from the center.\n*   **Placing the Charge:** A positive point charge $+q$ is placed *inside* the cavity.\n\n**2. Electrostatic Induction**\n\n*   The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will exert an electric force on the free electrons within the conductor.\n*   Electrons will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge. They will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor, which is the wall of the cavity. To completely cancel the electric field from the charge $+q$ *inside the bulk of the conductor*, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a surface drawn entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity. Inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ must be zero.\n*   The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must be left behind on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation (Total Charge = $0 = (-q)_{inner} + (+q)_{outer}$).\n\n**3. The Principle of Electrostatic Shielding**\n\n*   A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it completely shields the exterior region from the electrostatic influence of any charges placed inside it.\n*   The combined electric field produced by the original charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n*   Therefore, for any point P *outside* the main spherical conductor, the electric field contribution from the charge in the cavity and the charge on the inner wall is zero.\n\n**4. Calculating the Electric Field at Point P**\n\n*   Since the charges inside the conductor (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$) produce no field at point P, the only charge that contributes to the field at P is the induced charge $+q$ located on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n*   How is this charge $+q$ distributed on the outer surface? The outer surface is a perfect sphere. Due to the shielding effect of the conductor, the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the non-symmetrical position of the cavity and the charge inside it. The charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to make the conductor an equipotential surface. In the absence of any other external fields, they will distribute themselves perfectly uniformly over the spherical outer surface.\n*   **The Shell Theorem:** For a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n*   In our case, we have a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly on the outer sphere. Point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of this sphere.\n*   Applying the shell theorem, the electric field at P is equivalent to the field of a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The magnitude of the electric field from a point charge is given by Coulomb's Law: $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{|charge|}{(distance)^2}$.\n*   The effective charge is $+q$.\n*   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is $L$.\n*   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Careful Points and Distractors**\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The radius of the cavity ($r$), the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to point P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors. They describe the internal geometry, but due to electrostatic shielding, this internal configuration has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n*   **The Key Concepts:** The solution hinges on two crucial concepts:\n    1.  **Charge Induction and Conservation:** Placing a charge inside a neutral conductor induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface and an equal and like charge on the outer surface.\n    2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A conducting shell isolates the exterior from the interior's electric fields.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct formula for the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor ($L$).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** To shield the conductor from the electric field of the charge $+q$, a total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if you imagine a Gaussian surface within the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero. Therefore, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero, which means the charge induced on the cavity wall must be exactly $-q$.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Superposition of Electric Fields:** The total electric field at the external point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The original point charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. In our case, the conducting material acts as a shield. The combined electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is **exactly zero** everywhere outside the cavity. This means these two charge distributions do not contribute to the electric field at point P.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface:** Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$. Because the conducting material shields the outer surface from the charges inside the cavity, the distribution of the $+q$ charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. Since there are no other external charges, the charge $+q$ will spread out **uniformly** over the spherical outer surface due to symmetry.\n\n7.  **Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** The electric field at an external point P, at a distance $L$ from the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge $+q$, is given by the same formula as the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the sphere.\n\n8.  **Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is therefore:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{Q_{total\\_on\\_outer\\_surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are provided to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The correct answer is based solely on the total charge and the distance from the center of the outer spherical conductor.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis problem involves the principles of electrostatics, specifically concerning conductors and electrostatic shielding.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces charges on the conductor's surfaces. A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity), and a charge of `+q` is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. This is necessary to ensure the electric field within the material of the conductor is zero, a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor effectively isolates the outside region from the electric field created by the charge inside the cavity. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced *only* by the charges residing on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined electric field of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity because of the shielding effect of the conductor. Since the outer surface is a sphere, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is uniformly distributed. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the large spherical conductor, will be the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the center.\n\nThe magnitude of this electric field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe position of the cavity (`s`), the radius of the cavity (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge +q placed inside the cavity will attract negative charges from the conductor to the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). To completely cancel the electric field within the conducting material, a total charge of -q is induced on this inner surface. Because the charge +q is not at the center of the cavity, this induced charge -q will be distributed non-uniformly on the inner surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that they provide electrostatic shielding. The conducting material isolates the outer surface from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (+q) and on the cavity's inner wall (-q). This means the arrangement of charges inside does not influence the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface is a sphere and it is shielded from the internal (and any external) fields, the induced charge +q will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, for the point P located at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, the electric field is determined solely by the +q charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This is equivalent to having a point charge of +q at the center of the large sphere. The complex arrangement inside the cavity (the exact position 's', the distance 'l', the angle 'Î¸') is irrelevant to the field outside due to shielding.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem deals with the principles of electrostatic shielding by a conductor.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, `-q`, on the inner surface of the cavity. This occurs to ensure the electric field within the bulk of the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, to maintain its overall charge neutrality, a positive charge `+q` must appear on its outer surface.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the absence of any other external electric fields, and because the conductor is spherical, this induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the spherical conductor. The arrangement of the charge *inside* the cavity does not affect the distribution of the charge on the *outer* surface. This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding; the conductor isolates the outside region from the influence of the charge inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is the same as the field from a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at a distance `L` from a point charge `q` is given by:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l` (distance from the cavity's center to P), `s` (distance from conductor's center to cavity's center), and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and charge placement:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n    *   A positive charge, `+q`, is placed inside a cavity within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of charge induction in conductors:**\n    *   An electric field exists inside the cavity due to the charge `+q`.\n    *   However, a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material itself must be zero.\n    *   To achieve this, the free electrons within the conductor rearrange themselves. Negative charges (electrons) are attracted towards the `+q` charge and accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   To find the total charge induced on the inner surface, we can imagine a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conducting material. Since the electric field everywhere on this surface is zero, the net electric flux through it is zero. By Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_o}$), the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` and the induced charge on the inner surface, `q_inner`.\n    *   Therefore, `q + q_inner = 0`, which means `q_inner = -q`. A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Consider the charge on the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. We have established that a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface.\n    *   Due to the law of conservation of charge, a corresponding positive charge must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain its overall initial charge (which was zero). This positive charge moves to the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   The charge on the outer surface, `q_outer`, must be `+q` so that the total charge of the conductor remains `q_inner + q_outer = -q + q = 0`.\n\n4.  **Determine the distribution of the outer surface charge:**\n    *   The charge `+q` is now on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the configuration of charges inside the cavity (`+q` and the induced `-q`).\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field outside the conductor:**\n    *   We need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor.\n    *   The electric field at any point outside a conductor is produced solely by the charges on its outer surface (and any other charges that might be external to the conductor, of which there are none in this problem).\n    *   We have a uniformly distributed charge `+q` on a spherical shell of radius `R`.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the total charge on the outer shell is `+q`. The center of the spherical conductor is O. The distance of point P from the center O is `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given information:**\n    *   The information about the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance of P from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) is all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the electrostatic shielding effect. This extra information is intended to distract from the core principle.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The electric field at the external point P depends only on the net charge that appears on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charges and Conductor:** We start with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside a cavity within this conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This creates an induced negative charge on the inner surface. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field `E` inside the conductor's material must be zero.\n    According to Gauss's Law: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the total enclosed charge $Q_{enclosed}$ must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge `+q` placed in the cavity and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$.\n    So, $q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$.\n    A total charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface (by moving electrons from other parts of the conductor), a net charge of `+q` must be left behind somewhere else on the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality. In a conductor, excess charge resides on its surface(s). Therefore, a charge of `+q` will appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges inside it. In our case, the conductor itself acts as this shield. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on the outer surface. The internal charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall are arranged in such a way that their combined electric field is exactly zero for all points outside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor, which is a sphere of radius R. Since there are no other external electric fields mentioned in the problem, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to be in the lowest energy state (maximum separation).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion on Extra Information:** The information about the cavity's radius (`r`), its position (`s`), the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` is all irrelevant to finding the electric field *outside* the conductor. This information would be necessary if one were to calculate the field *inside* the cavity, but for the exterior field, the shielding effect simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n8.  **Comparing with Options:** The derived expression for the electric field is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the System and Charges**: We have a system with three components to consider for the electric field at an external point P:\n    *   The original point charge `+q` placed inside the cavity.\n    *   The charge induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   The charge induced on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface**: The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the wall of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface inside the bulk of the conductor (where the electric field must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium), the net charge enclosed must be zero. Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be `-q` to cancel out the `+q` charge.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface**: The conductor was initially uncharged (total charge = 0). To maintain overall charge neutrality, if a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must be left behind. This excess charge of `+q` will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Principle of Electrostatic Shielding**: A fundamental property of a closed conductor is that it acts as a \"Faraday cage.\" It shields the region outside the conductor from the electric fields of any charges inside it. This means that the combined electric field produced by the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero for all points outside the conductor, including point P.\n\n5.  **Field Contribution at Point P**: Due to the shielding effect, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at the external point P is the charge `+q` located on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Field from the Outer Charge Distribution**: Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other charges external to the conductor, the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this outer surface.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem**: For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to the field that would be produced by a single point charge with the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   The effective charge creating the field at P is `+q`.\n    *   This charge can be treated as a point charge at the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The other parameters provided (`r`, `s`, `l`, `Î¸`) describe the internal configuration of the cavity and the charge within it. Due to electrostatic shielding, these details are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside it, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$. A point charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors:**\n    *   **Induced Charges:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will polarize the conductor. To understand the effect, consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = 0$). This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must also be zero ($Q_{enclosed} = 0$).\n    *   Since the original charge $+q$ is inside the cavity (and thus inside our Gaussian surface), a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity to make the total enclosed charge zero. This induced charge $-q$ will not be distributed uniformly on the inner surface; it will be more concentrated on the side closer to the $+q$ charge.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface of the cavity, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality. This $+q$ charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding and the Outer Surface:** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electrostatic effects of any charges inside it. The electric field inside the conductor is zero, which means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely independent of the arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$). The $+q$ charge on the outer surface will distribute itself as if the charges inside did not exist.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** For a spherical conductor, the charge on its outer surface will distribute itself uniformly to minimize repulsion, creating a uniform surface charge density. This is the only distribution that ensures the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.\n\n6.  **Calculating the External Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** Now, the problem of finding the electric field at point P outside the conductor simplifies. We only need to consider the field produced by the uniform shell of charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. The combined effect of the charge $+q$ in the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, the charge on the outer surface is $+q$, and it's distributed uniformly over a sphere centered at the center of the conductor.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total effective charge producing the field at point P is $+q$.\n    *   This effective charge is located at the center of the conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point P is given as $L$.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The detailed information about the cavity's position ($s$), its radius ($r$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor, due to the shielding effect. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This matches our derivation.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Induced Charges:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged spherical conductor will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface.\n2.  **Charge Neutrality:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall charge neutrality, since a `-q` charge has been induced on the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges placed inside it. The conductor prevents the electric field from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface from reaching the region outside the conductor.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical shape of the conductor and the shielding effect, the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (this is a result from Gauss's Law). Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface. This is equivalent to the field of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n6.  **Calculating the Magnitude:** The distance from the center of the spherical conductor to point P is given as `L`. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The variables `l`, `s`, and `Î¸` which describe the position of the cavity and the point P relative to the cavity are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, option D matches the derived expression.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the spherical cavity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). To maintain its overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear somewhere else on the conductor. In a conductor, charges are free to move and will reside on the surface. Thus, a charge of `+q` is induced on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. The electric field inside the conducting material is zero. For any point outside the conductor, the electric field is solely determined by the charge distribution on the outer surface. The arrangement of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface has no net effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface of the conductor, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this surface. This happens regardless of the shape or position of the cavity inside.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a single point at its center.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** In this problem, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is distributed uniformly on a sphere of radius `R` centered at the conductor's center. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P is equivalent to that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis means the distances `l`, `r`, `s` and the angle `Î¸` are not needed to determine the field outside the conductor.

This causes a charge of $-q$ to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the arrangement of charges inside the conductor (the $+q$ in the cavity and the induced $-q$ on the cavity wall) has no effect on the electric field outside the conductor. Symmetrically, any external charges would not affect the field inside the cavity. The electric field at point P is therefore produced solely by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will spread out uniformly. Because the outer surface is a sphere, the charge distribution will be spherically symmetric, regardless of the off-center position of the cavity and the charge within it.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all extraneous details, designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
