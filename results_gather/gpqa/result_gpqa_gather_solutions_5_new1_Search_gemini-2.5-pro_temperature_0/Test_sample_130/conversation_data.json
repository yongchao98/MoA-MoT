  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nA dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, so they appear as a single peak. The given shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of these protons.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This matches the given data of two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Products of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond (or more accurately, tucked under the diene system in the transition state). This is typically the major, kinetically-favored product.\n*   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the double bond. This is typically the minor, thermodynamically-favored product.\n\nThe problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* isomers. The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Assign ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the adducts. They have a plane of symmetry passing through the anhydride oxygen, the C=C bond, and the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Proton Types:**\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift is typically low for aliphatic methyls, ~1.0 ppm.\n    2.  **Alkene Methyls:** Four methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Being attached to sp² carbons, they are more deshielded than the bridgehead methyls, ~1.7 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** Two protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are equivalent by symmetry and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Signal: **2H singlet**. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they are deshielded, ~3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They couple to each other, forming an AB quartet (two doublets). The *anti* proton is typically less shielded than the *syn* proton. The problem describes one of these as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which we can assign to the *anti* proton (H_anti).\n\n*   **Summary of Signal Assignments:**\n    *   ~1.0 ppm: 6H singlet (Bridgehead -CH₃)\n    *   ~1.7 ppm: 6H singlet (Alkene -CH₃)\n    *   ~3.5 ppm: 2H singlet (Anhydride H_a)\n    *   ~1.5 ppm: 1H doublet (Bridge H_anti)\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers**\n\nNOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find which pair of protons fits this description.\n\n*   **Major Product (Endo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *exo* position (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   The methylene bridge has two protons: H_syn (pointing towards the double bond) and H_anti (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   Crucially, in the *endo* isomer, both the anhydride protons (H_a) and the bridge proton (H_anti) are on the *exo* face of the molecule. They are spatially close.\n    *   **Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between H_a (~3.5 ppm) and H_anti (~1.5 ppm) is expected for the major (endo) product.**\n\n*   **Minor Product (Exo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the *exo* face. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *endo* position (pointing towards the double bond).\n    *   The bridge proton H_anti is still on the *exo* face.\n    *   In this isomer, H_a (*endo*) and H_anti (*exo*) are on opposite sides of the molecule and are far apart.\n    *   **Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between H_a and H_anti would be absent or very weak for the minor (exo) product.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Finding to the Options**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects:\n*   The anhydride protons (H_a): **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The anti-bridge proton (H_anti): **a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A) Me(bridgehead) and Me(alkene) are close in both isomers.\n*   B) Me(bridgehead) and H_anti are close in both isomers.\n*   D) Me(alkene) and H_a are far apart in the major (*endo*) isomer but close in the minor (*exo*) isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, giving one signal at ~7 ppm. The two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) give two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic ring system.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Products (Major and Minor):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the reaction, making it the kinetically favored product. The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures using the standard numbering for a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system:\n        *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7-methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the two methine protons (H5, H6) from the maleic anhydride part point *towards* the C2=C3 double bond, which bears the four methyl groups.\n        *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7-methylene bridge. Here, the H5 and H6 protons point *away* from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on the structures determined above:\n        *   In the **endo (major) product**, the H5/H6 protons are close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, a NOE cross-peak between them is expected.\n        *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the H5/H6 protons are far from these methyl groups. A NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation. The key cross-peak connects the H5/H6 protons with the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options:**\n    *   **H5/H6 Protons:** These two methine protons are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. They are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** is very reasonable. The option describes this as a \"2H singlet\".\n    *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are expected to appear as two distinct sets. Each set contains two methyl groups, leading to two signals, each with an integral of **6H**. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** is appropriate for methyl groups on a double bond in such a system. The option refers to \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\".\n    *   **Bridge Protons (C7-H₂):** These two protons are diastereotopic and would likely appear as two distinct signals, probably doublets. The option \"a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" likely corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n    *   **Other Methyl Protons:** The other set of vinyl methyls is given as \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm\".\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product connects the H5/H6 methine protons with one of the sets of vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Matching this with the provided options:\n        *   **\"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\"** corresponds to one set of vinyl methyl groups.\n        *   **\"A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"** corresponds to the H5/H6 methine protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: First, we need to determine the structures of the two starting materials.\n    *   **Dienophile**: The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This high degree of symmetry points to maleic acid, which dehydrates to form **maleic anhydride**. The NMR data is consistent: the two equivalent alkene protons give a single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons give two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**: The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked under the newly formed ring, is usually the kinetically favored and thus the **major product**. The *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Product Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**: The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the spatial relationships between protons in the two products, which is what a 2D NOESY experiment reveals. A cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum indicates that two sets of protons are physically close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   **Proton Assignments**: Both products have a plane of symmetry. We can identify four main types of protons:\n        1.  **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm).\n        2.  **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm).\n        3.  **H_anhydride**: The two protons on the five-membered anhydride ring (2H singlet, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls to ~3.5 ppm).\n        4.  **H_bridge**: The two protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side of the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_vinyl** protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, they are close to the **Me_bridgehead** protons.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. Based on our analysis, this specific interaction corresponds to the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons in the endo adduct. Matching our chemical shift and integration assignments to the options provided:\n    *   H_anhydride: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   Me_vinyl: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Define the problem and the options provided.\nproblem_description = \"\"\"\nA dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. \nThis anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, \nwas reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). \nBoth products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. \nA cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak?\n\"\"\"\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\",\n    \"B\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\",\n    \"C\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\",\n    \"D\": \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"\n}\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the reaction and products based on chemical principles.\n# Reactants: Maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n# Reaction: Diels-Alder.\n# Products: Endo (major) and Exo (minor) adducts.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the spatial proximity of protons for NOESY.\n# Proton types and estimated chemical shifts:\n# - Me_vinyl (vinylic methyls): 6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm\n# - Me_bridgehead (bridgehead methyls): 6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm\n# - H_anhydride (protons on anhydride ring): 2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm\n\n# NOE interactions:\n# - In the major (endo) product, H_anhydride protons are close to Me_vinyl protons.\n# - In the minor (exo) product, H_anhydride protons are far from Me_vinyl protons.\n\n# The question asks for the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor.\n# This corresponds to the interaction between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl.\n\n# Step 4: Match the interacting protons to the given options.\n# Interacting protons: H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n# This matches the description in option B.\n\nfinal_answer = \"B\"\n\n# Step 5: Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"The reasoning leads to the conclusion that the cross-peak in the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride ring protons.\")\nprint(f\"Based on the provided options, the correct choice is:\")\nprint(f\"B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {final_answer}\")\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 52\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile**\n\n*   The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ability to form a cyclic anhydride implies the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the molecule. A cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid like maleic acid fits this description perfectly.\n*   The anhydride's NMR data is provided:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n*   This data points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (one ¹³C signal) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (a second ¹³C signal).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n\n*   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups attached to the sp² hybridized carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the **endo** product and the **exo** product.\n    *   In the **endo** product, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the diene's original π-system (which becomes the double bond in the product). The endo product is usually the kinetically favored, **major product**.\n    *   In the **exo** product, the anhydride ring points away from the double bond. The exo product is usually the thermodynamically favored, **minor product**.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the endo and exo isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structures and Proton Environments**\n\n*   Let's analyze the protons in the product structure (a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative):\n    1.  **Alkene Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are attached to the C=C double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons (saturated sp³ carbons). They are also equivalent due to symmetry and will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.2 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons:** These are the two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride. They are attached to carbons that are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a 2H singlet (coupling to the bridgehead protons is often negligible due to a ~90° dihedral angle). Their chemical shift will be relatively high due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyls, around 3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7) are generally not equivalent and would couple to each other, often appearing as a complex multiplet or two doublets. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially-proximate protons.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial interaction that exists in the endo isomer but not in the exo isomer.\n*   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n    *   **Endo (Major) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the C=C double bond. This brings the **anhydride protons** very close to the **alkene methyl protons**.\n    *   **Exo (Minor) Isomer:** The anhydride ring points *away* from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons are far from the alkene methyl protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Interacting Protons to the NMR Signals**\n\n*   Based on our chemical shift analysis in Step 4:\n    *   The **alkene methyl protons** correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The **anhydride protons** correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects these two signals.\n\n**Step 7: Select the Correct Answer**\n\n*   We are looking for the option that connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm with a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n*   Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). Incorrect.\n*   Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). **This is the correct answer.**\n*   Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This interaction would be stronger in the exo (minor) product. Incorrect.\n*   Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls). These groups are not close enough for a strong NOE. Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid forms a cyclic anhydride.\n        *   The ¹H NMR shows a single peak, meaning all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks, meaning there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H shift ~7 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons: two alkene carbons (¹³C shift ~137 ppm) and two carbonyl carbons (¹³C shift ~165 ppm).\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring with O, C=O, C(H)=C(H), C=O.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The reaction of a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) results in a bicyclic product with a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** core.\n    *   The product's molecular formula is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). The formula is correct.\n    *   The product structure is **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n        *   The **endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, formed through a transition state with favorable secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n        *   **Major Product = Endo isomer.**\n        *   **Minor Product = Exo isomer.**\n\n3.  **Analyze the 3D Structures of the Endo and Exo Isomers**\n    *   In the bicyclo[2.2.1] system, substituents on the C5/C6 bridge can be *endo* (pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond) or *exo* (pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond, towards the C7 bridge).\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring itself is in the *endo* position (tucked under the C2=C3 double bond). This means the two protons on C5 and C6 (originating from maleic anhydride) are in the *exo* position. In this orientation, they point towards the C7 bridge. The C7 bridge has two protons, one *syn* to the double bond and one *anti*. The *exo* protons at C5/C6 are spatially close to the *anti* proton on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This means the protons on C5 and C6 are in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, they are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states there is a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum that is absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis, the close proximity between the **protons at C5/C6** and the ***anti* proton at C7** is a unique feature of the major (*endo*) isomer. This interaction is absent in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak must connect the signals for these specific protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the molecule:\n        *   **Protons at C5/C6 (from anhydride):** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. Their chemical shift will be significantly downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n        *   **Protons at C7 (bridge):** These are two diastereotopic protons on a methylene bridge. They would typically appear as two separate signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. A chemical shift around 1-2 ppm is expected. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups. The vinylic methyls (at C2/C3) are deshielded relative to the bridgehead methyls (at C1/C4).\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two vinylic methyl groups.\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to the two bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The unique NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the protons at C5/C6 with one of the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction between the resonance at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and the resonance at **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). These are far apart in the endo isomer.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). An NOE might exist, but it would likely be present in both isomers, not a distinguishing feature.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This corresponds to the unique spatial proximity in the major (endo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride is maleic acid. The resulting anhydride is maleic anhydride. The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products (Stereoisomers):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetic control), due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is generally more stable (thermodynamic product) because it is less sterically hindered, but it forms more slowly.\n    *   Since the problem states a major and a minor product are formed, we can identify the major product as the *endo* isomer and the minor product as the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the *Endo* and *Exo* Products:**\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   There are four methyl groups: two on the bridgehead carbons (let's call them **Me-bridgehead**) and two on the double bond of the new six-membered ring (let's call them **Me-alkene**).\n    *   There are two equivalent protons where the anhydride ring is fused to the bicyclic system (let's call them **H-anhydride**).\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the diene system, on the same side as the newly formed double bond. This places the **H-anhydride** protons in close spatial proximity to the **Me-alkene** groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the diene system. This places the **H-anhydride** protons far from the **Me-alkene** groups but close to the **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n\n4.  **Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n    *   This specific cross-peak must correspond to an interaction unique to the *endo* (major) isomer. Based on our structural analysis, this is the interaction between the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H-anhydride:** These are two equivalent methine protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. They will be deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** (as a singlet due to symmetry) is a reasonable assignment.\n    *   **Me-alkene:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). They are deshielded compared to standard alkyl methyls. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is a good estimate.\n    *   **Me-bridgehead:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a more shielded environment. A chemical shift of **~1.0 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is expected.\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis to the Options:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect integration and multiplicity for the methyl signal.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal for the anhydride protons.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This correctly identifies the alkene methyls and the anhydride protons, which are close in space in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances of the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride bridgehead protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The 7 ppm shift is characteristic of vinylic (alkene) protons.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest a molecule with two types of carbon atoms. The 165 ppm peak is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the 137 ppm peak is in the range for an alkene carbon.\n        *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃), fits this data perfectly. It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O and two C=C), which explains the observed spectra.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a five-membered ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. Typically, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored major product, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable minor product. The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, consistent with the formation of both isomers.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Adducts and Proton Assignments:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n    *   **Protons and Signals:**\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are on saturated carbons and will appear as a 6H singlet at a lower chemical shift, estimated around **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_alkene:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). These vinylic methyls will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher chemical shift, estimated around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **H_A:** Two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (C5, C6). These protons are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be a 2H singlet, shifted downfield to around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **C7 Protons:** The CH₂ bridge has two diastereotopic protons (*syn* and *anti* to the double bond). They will appear as two separate 1H signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. Their shift is estimated to be around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **NOESY Analysis to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The key to distinguishing the *endo* and *exo* isomers is identifying which protons are brought close together in each configuration.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are far from the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C7 bridge and is on the same side as the double bond. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n        *   The NOE interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene) is strong and characteristic for the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n        *   Therefore, the absence of this peak is characteristic of the *endo* (major) isomer.\n        *   The question asks for a cross-peak that *is present* in the major product. Let's re-examine the options based on our signal assignments.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **Signal Assignments:**\n        *   6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm → Me_alkene\n        *   2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm → H_A (anhydride protons)\n        *   6H singlet at ~1 ppm → Me_bridgehead\n        *   1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm → C7 bridge proton\n    *   **Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene):** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is significant in both isomers. A strong, differentiating NOE is not expected.\n    *   **Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** This corresponds to the interaction between the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride protons. As established, this interaction is characteristic of the *exo* (minor) product. Since the question asks for a cross-peak in the *major* product's spectrum which is absent in the minor, this is the inverse of what is described. However, it is the most significant stereochemical differentiating peak. There might be a misunderstanding in the problem's premise or the common kinetic/thermodynamic product distribution for this specific highly substituted system. Let's reconsider. The *endo* product is the kinetic product due to secondary orbital overlap. The *exo* is the thermodynamic product because it's less sterically hindered. The reaction is likely run under kinetic control, making the *endo* product major. But what if the steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene is so significant that it reverses the usual selectivity, making the *exo* product the major one? If the *exo* product were the major product, then the cross-peak between Me_alkene (~1.7 ppm) and H_A (~3.5 ppm) would be the correct answer. Given the options, this is the most plausible chemical scenario that leads to one of the answers.\n    *   **Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** An interaction between H_A and a C7 proton exists in both isomers (with H_anti in *endo* and H_syn in *exo*). It is unlikely to be strongly present in one and completely absent in the other.\n    *   **Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton):** The distance between the bridgehead methyls and the C7 protons should be similar in both isomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most significant and differentiating NOE interaction is between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene). This interaction is strong in the *exo* isomer and very weak or absent in the *endo* isomer. The question describes a peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor. If we assume the major product is the *exo* isomer (which is plausible due to the steric bulk of the four methyl groups on the diene overriding the usual *endo* preference), then the cross-peak would be between the 6H singlet of the alkene methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This matches option B.\n\nFinal check: The interaction described in B is the most chemically sound for differentiating the two stereoisomers via NOESY. The ambiguity lies in which isomer is major. In many simple cases, *endo* is major. However, with heavily substituted dienes, this can be reversed. Assuming the question and options lead to a correct chemical conclusion, the most logical answer is that the major product is *exo*, and the observed cross-peak is between the spatially proximate alkene methyls and anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe analysis of the chemical problem proceeds in several steps:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons (~7 ppm), alkene carbons (~137 ppm), and carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic [4+2] cycloaddition known as the Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the substituted cyclopentadiene acts as the diene.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Products:** The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one, both with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. In Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes, two stereoisomeric products can form: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore major product, formed due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is generally the thermodynamically more stable, but minor, product. Thus, the major product is the *endo* isomer and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing Products with NOESY NMR:** A 2D NOESY experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space correlation), which is ideal for distinguishing between *endo* and *exo* isomers. A cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one points to a unique spatial relationship in the *endo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Structural and Spectral Analysis:**\n    *   **Symmetry and Proton Signals:** The resulting bicyclic product has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two methyl groups on the double bond equivalent (a 6H singlet), the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons equivalent (another 6H singlet), and the two protons on the anhydride portion of the ring equivalent (a 2H singlet).\n    *   **Chemical Shift Assignments:**\n        *   The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them H_succinyl) are alpha to carbonyl groups and are typically found around 3.5 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene) are vinylic methyls and are expected to be more deshielded than saturated methyls. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead) would be further upfield, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   The remaining signal, a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, belongs to one of the protons on the methylene bridge.\n    *   ***Endo* vs. *Exo* Geometry:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the newly formed six-membered ring. This geometry brings the H_succinyl protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the H_succinyl protons are far from the Me_alkene groups but are close to the methylene bridge protons and the bridgehead methyl groups.\n    *   **The Decisive Cross-Peak:** The NOESY cross-peak observed in the major product but not the minor product must be due to the interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry. This is the close proximity between the H_succinyl protons and the Me_alkene protons. Therefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   The high symmetry (single ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and the chemical shifts are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H singlet ~7.0-7.3 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons (alkene carbons ~137 ppm and carbonyl carbons ~165 ppm). This perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C=C-C=C).\n    *   The four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) each have a methyl group.\n    *   The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The product's molecular formula should be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given for the products, confirming our reactant identification.\n\n**3. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction with a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene can produce two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n*   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction under kinetic control is the *endo* adduct. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the dienophile's activating groups (the anhydride part) and the developing double bond in the transition state. The *exo* adduct is typically the minor product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures: The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the newly formed double bond (C(Me)=C(Me)) and on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. This means the anhydride protons are *syn* (on the same face) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the CH₂ bridge and on the opposite side of the double bond. This means the anhydride protons are *anti* (on opposite faces) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's analyze the key proximities:\n    *   **Interaction 1: Anhydride Protons vs. Alkene Methyl Groups.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the alkene methyl groups. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the alkene methyl groups. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n    *   **Interaction 2: Anhydride Protons vs. CH₂ Bridge Protons.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n\n*   Since the distinguishing cross-peak is present in the major product (endo), it must be due to the interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl groups**.\n\n**5. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\n*   Now we need to match these proton groups to the signals described in the options.\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two of them. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to bridgehead carbons with no protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**. Their chemical shift, being on a strained ring and alpha to two carbonyl groups, will be relatively high, around 3-4 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Alkene Methyl Groups:** There are two methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. This will give a **singlet** with an integral of **6H**. The chemical shift for methyl groups on a double bond is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups on sp³ carbons. This would be a 6H singlet at a lower shift, ~1.0 ppm.\n*   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons, likely giving a complex signal (or two doublets) integrating to 2H in the aliphatic region.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl groups.\n*   These correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   This matches option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n*   B) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, alkene Me). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies the unique NOE cross-peak in the major product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C).\n    *   The single ¹H peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. The shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons in an electron-deficient environment.\n    *   The two ¹³C peaks indicate two types of carbons, consistent with equivalent alkene carbons and equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, leading to the observed simple NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. It has four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n    *   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₂.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring.\n*   The product is a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene ring becomes a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is usually the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically controlled). This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is usually the minor product.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the formation of the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Products**\n\n*   Let's draw the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) adducts.\n    *   The resulting bicyclic system is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.\n    *   There are methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C5 and C6.\n    *   There are two protons at C5 and C6, which came from the maleic anhydride.\n    *   There is a CH₂ bridge at C7.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₂) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This suggests a subsequent reaction, likely hydrogenation of a double bond, has occurred. However, the chemical shifts provided in the options (especially 1.7 ppm for a methyl group) are characteristic of the un-hydrogenated product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃), where the methyl group is attached to a double bond (vinylic methyl). A methyl group in the hydrogenated product would appear at a much higher field (~1.0-1.2 ppm). This strong contradiction suggests the molecular formula given in the problem is a typo, and we should proceed by analyzing the structure of the direct Diels-Alder adduct, C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's examine the key distances in both isomers:\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. They are spatially close to the methyl groups on this double bond (at C2, C3). They are far from the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the opposite side of the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be between the **anhydride protons (H₅, H₆)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n\n*   Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the groups involved in this key NOE in the major (*endo*) product. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride protons (H₅, H₆):** These two protons are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and bridgehead carbons. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a downfield shift, estimated around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃):** These two methyl groups are attached to the double bond and are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. The typical shift for vinylic methyls is around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The NOESY cross-peak should connect these two signals. We are looking for an option that describes a correlation between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridge proton (H₇) and the anhydride protons (H₅, H₆), characteristic of the *minor* (exo) product.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. This interaction is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique feature distinguishing them.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This perfectly matches our prediction for the key NOE in the major (*endo*) product between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridgehead methyl group and a bridge proton.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product arises from the unique spatial proximity of the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups in the *endo* isomer. This corresponds to a NOE between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride (Dienophile):** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). A single peak implies that the vinylic protons are chemically equivalent, which points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks: one at 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O) and one at 137 ppm (characteristic of a vinylic carbon, C=C). The presence of only two signals for a molecule with at least four carbons confirms a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest and most common structure that fits all these criteria is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two vinylic carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals).\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring fused to the existing five-membered ring, creating a bicyclic system.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** **adduct** and the ***exo*** **adduct**.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is a 2D NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å apart), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Visualizing the Adducts:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C=C double bond. This places the two protons on the anhydride portion of the backbone (let's call them **H_anhydride**) in a position where they point towards the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"away\" from the C=C double bond. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in a position where they point towards the vinylic methyl groups on the C=C double bond and are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   **Identifying the Key NOE Interaction:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is unique to the major product is the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the protons on the **C7 bridge**.\n\n**4. Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n\nNow we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in our structure.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They will be significantly deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is appropriate. Due to a plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** The C7 bridge has two protons that are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled to each other, so they will appear as doublets. Being aliphatic protons in a strained ring, a chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is reasonable for one of them. This corresponds to a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the double bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are equivalent. They are more shielded and will appear as a **6H singlet** at **~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are not uniquely close in the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). This is not the key differentiating feature between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the alkene region.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks correspond to two types of carbons. The peak at 137 ppm is in the range for alkene carbons (C=C), and the peak at 165 ppm is in the range for anhydride carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n        *   The high symmetry (one type of proton, two types of carbon) and the spectral data perfectly match the structure of **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and a CH₂ group at C5. Each of the four carbons in the diene system has a methyl group attached.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* products. The *endo* product is usually the major product due to favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state (kinetic control).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   In the Diels-Alder reaction, the C1 and C4 of the diene react with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond. A new six-membered ring is formed, and the CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes a one-carbon bridge (C7) in a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   The resulting product is **1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n        *   **Methyl groups:** Two are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and two are on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   **Anhydride ring:** Fused at positions C2 and C3.\n        *   **Protons:** The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now at positions C2 and C3. The CH₂ bridge is at C7.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between the *Endo* (Major) and *Exo* (Minor) Isomers:**\n    *   The key difference is the stereochemistry of the fused anhydride ring relative to the C5=C6 double bond within the bicyclic system.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C5=C6 double bond. It is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C5=C6 double bond. It is on the same side (*syn*) of the C7 bridge.\n\n5.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum and Assign ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   NOESY shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (at C2 and C3). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C5=C6 double bond. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate in this region. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). Saturated alkyl methyl groups resonate here. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is likely one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n6.  **Identify the Key NOE Correlation:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers:\n        *   **In the *endo* (major) product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* to the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C2, C3) into close proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (at C5, C6). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   **In the *exo* (minor) product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* to the C5=C6 double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_alkene** groups. The NOE between them would be absent or very weak. Instead, the H_anhydride protons are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOE cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be the one between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n    *   This corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n    *   Looking at the options, this matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants**\n\n*   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C spectrum. This spectroscopic data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. The Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically favored product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n**3. Structure and NMR of the Products**\n\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. The reaction of the symmetric diene and symmetric dienophile results in a product with a plane of symmetry.\n*   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride).\n*   Based on the structure, we can predict the ¹H NMR signals:\n    *   **Two equivalent vinylic methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, typically around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, in a more shielded environment, around 1.0 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent protons from the anhydride part:** A singlet for 2 protons, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups, around 3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Two methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* or \"up\" and the other is *anti* or \"down\" relative to the double bond). They are not chemically equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two separate doublets. Their chemical shifts are typically around 1.3-1.5 ppm.\n*   This predicted spectrum (two 6H singlets, one 2H singlet, and two 1H doublets) is consistent with the signals described in the options.\n\n**4. Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicycloheptene system. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n*   **In the *exo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n*   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is a definitive characteristic of the *endo* adduct and will be absent in the *exo* adduct.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n*   The distinguishing cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* geometry.\n*   This corresponds to the interaction between the **anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two equivalent alkene protons give the single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons (137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (165 ppm) give the two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   When a cyclic diene and a cyclic dienophile react, a bicyclic product is formed. This reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry and Structure of Products:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond in the six-membered ring.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) to the double bond.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is an NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected through chemical bonds.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.

Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift will be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of methyl groups.\n            *   **Vinyl Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the carbons of the double bond.

This will result in a NOESY cross-peak.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the CH₂ bridge protons. This NOE interaction will be absent or very weak.\n\n4.  **Signal Assignment from the Question**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This chemical shift is characteristic of the protons on the anhydride ring, which are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This signal corresponds to one of the protons of the CH₂ bridge.

This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the bridge protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the signal for the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the signal for one of the bridge protons (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.

A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The ¹³C NMR signals at ~165 ppm and ~137 ppm are characteristic of anhydride carbonyl carbons and alkene carbons, respectively. Having only two peaks also indicates a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (giving one ¹H signal) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O carbons and two C=C carbons), giving two ¹³C signals. The starting acid was maleic acid. The formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. (C₅ ring + 4xCH₃ groups - 4xH atoms = C₉; 6H on parent cyclopentadiene ring - 4H + 4x3H = C₉H₁₄).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. According to the \"endo rule,\" the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored product, making it the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data**\n    *   The key to solving the problem is to understand the spatial arrangement of atoms in the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products and how this affects the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE), which gives rise to cross-peaks in a NOESY spectrum. NOEs are observed between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   We need to find a pair of proton groups that are close in the major product but far apart in the minor product.\n\n    Let's analyze the structures of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene adducts formed:\n    *   **Proton Groups:**\n        *   **H_anhydride:** The two equivalent protons on the carbons derived from maleic anhydride. They will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be around 3-4 ppm due to the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's assign this to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_vinyl:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (from C2 and C3 of the diene). They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their shift will be in the vinyl methyl region, ~1.6-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (from C1 and C4 of the diene). They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their shift will be around 1.0-1.5 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **H_bridge:** The two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge (CH₂ group). They will form a complex multiplet, likely appearing as two separate signals.\n\n    *   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n        *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *endo* (i.e., *syn* or cis to the C7 bridge). This places the **H_anhydride** protons in the *exo* position (i.e., *anti* or trans to the C7 bridge). In a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, *exo* substituents on the C5/C6 positions are on the same face as the C=C double bond. Therefore, in the major product, **H_anhydride protons are close to the Me_vinyl groups**. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *exo*. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in the *endo* position. *Endo* substituents on C5/C6 are on the opposite face of the C=C double bond. Therefore, in the minor product, **H_anhydride protons are far from the Me_vinyl groups**. The NOESY cross-peak will be absent or very weak.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. Our analysis shows that this specific observation corresponds to the interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n    *   The resonance for **Me_vinyl** is the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   The resonance for **H_anhydride** is the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n    Therefore, the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This corresponds to option A.\n\nLet's briefly dismiss the other options:\n*   B) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm): These groups are on adjacent carbons in both isomers. The NOE should be present in both major and minor products.\n*   C) A bridge proton (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm): This interaction is strong in the minor (*exo*) adduct (where H_anhydride is *endo*) and weak in the major (*endo*) adduct (where H_anhydride is *exo*). This is the opposite of the observation.\n*   D) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and a bridge proton (~1.5 ppm): These groups are close in both isomers, so the NOE should be present in both.\n\nThe correct answer identifies the interaction that uniquely characterizes the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a detailed analysis to determine which resonances are connected by the key cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n\n1.  **The Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent vinylic protons give the singlet at 7 ppm, while the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) account for the ¹³C signals. The molecular formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n2.  **The Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄), confirming it is an addition reaction.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Two stereoisomers, an *endo* and an *exo* product, are formed.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable product. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Endo* Isomer**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Exo* Isomer**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Spatial Relationships for NOESY\n\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) arises between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak in a 2D NOESY spectrum connects the signals of two such protons. The question states that a cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's visualize the two isomers:\n\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride part of the molecule is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 (CH₂) bridge. In this arrangement, the protons on the anhydride ring carbons (let's call them **H_anhydride**) are positioned underneath the bicyclic system, pointing toward the C2=C3 double bond. This brings them very close to the methyl groups attached to this double bond (the **vinylic methyl groups**).\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride part is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons point toward the C7 bridge and away from the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the key NOE that distinguishes the major (*endo*) product is the spatial interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **vinylic methyl** protons.\n\n### Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals\n\nNow, let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the product and match them to the options provided. The product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) has four main sets of protons:\n\n1.  **Vinylic Methyl Protons (6H):** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. These typically resonate around 1.6–2.2 ppm. Option D's \"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\" is a perfect match.\n2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (6H):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. These are more shielded and appear further upfield, typically around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_anhydride, 2H):** Two equivalent protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused. These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. A chemical shift in the range of 3-4 ppm is expected. Option D's \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\" is an excellent fit.\n4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons (2H):** The two protons of the C7 bridge.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Cross-Peak\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The distinguishing NOE in the major (*endo*) product is between the **vinylic methyl protons** and the **anhydride protons (H_anhydride)**.\n*   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me)\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)**\n\nThe correct answer is D, as it identifies the two groups of protons (vinylic methyls and anhydride methines) that are uniquely close in the major *endo* adduct, and correctly assigns their expected integrals and chemical shifts.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis problem describes a classic organic chemistry reaction and its analysis using NMR spectroscopy. Let's break it down step-by-step to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent (one signal), and by symmetry, there are only two types of carbons: the two alkene carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly given as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Identify the Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored). The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   In the **endo product**, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system, placing it \"under\" the double bond derived from the diene.\n    *   In the **exo product**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in 3D space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not bonded.\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* adduct.\n    *   Let's visualize the *endo* product. The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond of the other ring. This brings the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused very close to the two methyl groups that are also on that same face (*syn* methyls).\n    *   In the *exo* product, the anhydride ring points away, so these protons are far from the methyl groups. Therefore, the NOE interaction between the anhydride protons and the *syn* methyls is the key difference.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals:**\n    *   Let's look at the protons in the product and the signals provided in the options.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused. They are bridgehead protons and are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly, shifting them downfield to ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Two 6H singlets (~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm):** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. Due to the geometry of the bicyclic system, they are not equivalent. The two methyl groups on the same side as the anhydride ring (*syn* methyls) are in a different chemical environment than the two on the opposite side (*anti* methyls).\n        *   The *syn* methyls are spatially close to the electron-withdrawing anhydride ring. This proximity causes them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). Thus, they correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   The *anti* methyls are further away and are more shielded, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal likely corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the single-carbon bridge of the bicyclic system.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major (*endo*) product is between the protons that are only close in that isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride-fused protons (~3.5 ppm) and the *syn*-methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** and the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the Diels-Alder reaction and its products' NMR spectra\n    to determine the correct NOESY cross-peak for the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify reactants and reaction type.\n    # Dienophile: Maleic anhydride (from NMR data and dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid).\n    # Diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    # Reaction: Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n    # Step 2: Identify major and minor products.\n    # The major product is the kinetically favored 'endo' adduct.\n    # The minor product is the thermodynamically favored 'exo' adduct.\n    \n    # Step 3: Understand NOESY and the structural difference.\n    # NOESY shows through-space proton-proton proximity.\n    # We need a proximity present in the 'endo' product but absent in the 'exo' product.\n    # In the 'endo' adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked under the diene's original double bond.\n    # This brings the two protons on the anhydride-fused ring close to the 'syn' methyl groups (those on the same face as the anhydride).\n    # In the 'exo' adduct, the anhydride ring points away, so these protons are far from the methyl groups.\n\n    # Step 4: Assign the NMR signals from the options to the protons in the 'endo' product.\n    # - 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: These are the two protons on the anhydride-fused part of the ring.

The anhydride has highly symmetrical NMR spectra:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent alkene protons, deshielded by neighboring electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   This set of data uniquely identifies the starting material as *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid) and the resulting anhydride as **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's determine its structure. 1,3-cyclopentadiene has double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4. Methyl groups are placed at all four of these positions. The remaining C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n               C(5)H₂\n              /   \\\n        (Me)C(4)---C(1)(Me)\n             ||      ||\n        (Me)C(3)---C(2)(Me)\n        ```\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula. The diene has 9 carbon atoms (5 in the ring, 4 in methyl groups) and 14 hydrogen atoms (2 on C5, 12 in the four methyl groups). The formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction and Product Structure**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**.\n*   The reaction yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) adds across the C1 and C4 positions of the diene.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is typically the major product due to kinetic control (secondary orbital overlap), while the *exo* is the minor product.\n\n    *   **Major Product (Endo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (\"syn\") as the C2=C3 double bond bridge.\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (\"anti\") to the C2=C3 double bond bridge.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Spatial Proximity for NOESY Spectroscopy**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n*   The question asks for a cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* geometry but far apart in the *exo* geometry.\n\n*   Let's analyze the structures:\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them H_anhydride) are tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system. In this position, they are spatially close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The H_anhydride protons are pointing \"away\" from the bicyclic system. In this position, they are far from the Me_vinyl groups. They are, however, closer to the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead).\n\n*   Therefore, the key differentiating NOESY cross-peak is between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**. This interaction will be strong in the major (endo) product and absent in the minor (exo) product.\n\n**Step 4: Predict ¹H NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n\n*   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry. This leads to signal equivalence:\n    *   The two H_anhydride protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3.5 ppm) as they are alpha to carbonyls.\n    *   The two Me_vinyl groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. The chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is typically around ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   The two Me_bridgehead groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. They will be more shielded, with a shift around ~1.0 ppm.\n    *   The two protons on the C7 bridge are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n\n*   We are looking for the NOESY cross-peak between H_anhydride (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and Me_vinyl (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n*   Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups (Me_bridgehead and Me_vinyl). They are not uniquely close in the endo product.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: The signal description (1H doublet) does not match our analysis of the highly symmetric product.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This perfectly matches our predicted interaction between Me_vinyl (6H, ~1.7 ppm) and H_anhydride (2H, ~3.5 ppm).\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: The signal description (1H doublet) is inconsistent with the product's symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl) and the anhydride protons (H_anhydride). This corresponds to an interaction between a 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm), as described in option C. The \"1H doublet\" in options B and D appears to be inconsistent with the symmetry of the molecule and is likely a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at ~7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm, indicating two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   These data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent (appearing as a singlet, ~7.2 ppm in reality) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (~165 ppm), and the two vinyl carbons equivalent (~137 ppm).\n        *   Reactant 1: Maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1,3 and methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product would be C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* adduct, as it is formed faster (kinetically favored) due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* adduct is usually the minor product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structures of the *Endo* and *Exo* Products:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures. We can draw a side view of the bicyclic system. The key is the relative orientation of the anhydride ring with respect to the rest of the molecule, particularly the C7-CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. Consequently, the two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_A) are also on this side, pointing towards the C7-CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. The two H_A protons are pointing away from the C7-CH₂ bridge and towards the C=C double bond of the structure.\n\n    Here are simplified representations showing the key protons:\n\n    *   **Endo (Major Product):**\n        ```\n              (C7-CH2 Bridge)\n                  /   \\\n        ...---H_A ... H_A---...\n        Protons H_A are CLOSE to the C7-CH2 bridge protons.\n        ```\n    *   **Exo (Minor Product):**\n        ```\n        ...---H_A ... H_A---...\n                  \\   /\n              (C7-CH2 Bridge)\n        Protons H_A are FAR from the C7-CH2 bridge protons.\n        (They are close to the alkene methyl groups instead).\n        ```\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This cross-peak must arise from a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis in step 3, the pair of protons that fits this description is **H_A** (the anhydride protons) and the **C7-CH₂ bridge protons**.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals from the Options:**\n    *   The product molecule is symmetrical, leading to fewer signals than protons.\n        *   The two H_A protons are equivalent: **2H singlet**.\n        *   The two methyl groups on the alkene are equivalent: **6H singlet**.\n        *   The two methyl groups on the bridgeheads are equivalent: **6H singlet**.\n        *   The two protons on the C7-CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic and couple to each other: **two 1H signals, likely doublets**.\n    *   Let's match these to the signals described in the options:\n        *   **A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the anhydride protons, **H_A**. The chemical shift is reasonable for protons alpha to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        *   **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This corresponds to one of the **C7-CH₂ bridge protons**. Shielded protons on a C7 bridge in norbornene systems often appear in this region.\n        *   **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the vinylic methyl groups.\n        *   **A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** This corresponds to the more shielded bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The differentiating NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects protons that are uniquely close in that isomer.\n    *   This is the interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the C7-CH₂ bridge protons.\n    *   Matching this to the assigned signals: The cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_A) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (a C7-CH₂ proton).\n    *   This corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n    Let's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n    *   B) Interaction between a bridgehead methyl and a bridge proton. This distance is similar in both isomers.\n    *   C) Interaction between an alkene methyl and an anhydride proton (H_A). This interaction would be strong in the *minor* (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n    *   D) Interaction between the two sets of methyl groups. This distance is fixed in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the anhydride protons and the C7-bridge protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high degree of symmetry, along with the chemical shifts, points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two vinyl protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is often favored due to secondary orbital interactions (kinetic control). However, the diene used here is heavily substituted with four methyl groups.\n    *   The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene create significant steric hindrance. This hindrance disfavors the *endo* transition state, where the anhydride ring would be tucked underneath and clash with these methyl groups.\n    *   Consequently, the *exo* transition state is less sterically hindered and leads to the **exo adduct as the major product**. The *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and Expected NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the major (*exo*) product but not in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the product:\n        *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons (Meₐ):** Two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the newly formed cyclohexene ring. They are equivalent by symmetry. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Meₑ):** Two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.0-1.2 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride-Junction Protons (Hₓ):** The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. They are equivalent by symmetry and not coupled to other protons. Signal: **2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm** (deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups).\n    *   Now, let's consider the spatial arrangement in each isomer:\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the CH₂ bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) are oriented inward, pointing directly toward the vinyl methyl groups (Meₐ). This proximity will result in a **strong NOESY cross-peak** between Hₓ and Meₐ.\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge. Here, the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) are oriented outward, far away from the vinyl methyl groups (Meₐ). Therefore, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak will be **absent or very weak**.\n\n5.  **Match the Findings with the Options:**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak, present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor (*endo*), connects the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) and the vinyl methyl protons (Meₐ).\n    *   The signals are: a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (Hₓ) and a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Meₐ).\n    *   This corresponds directly to option D.\n\n    *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Incorrect integration and multiplicity for the methyl group signal.\n    *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Incorrect signal for the anhydride-junction protons.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups. While possible, it is not the key distinguishing interaction between the two isomers.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches the expected NOE correlation between the vinyl methyl protons and the anhydride-junction protons in the major *exo* product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying the reactants, predicting the products of a Diels-Alder reaction, and then using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, specifically a 2D NOESY experiment, to determine the stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification**: A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The high symmetry of maleic anhydride results in the two alkene protons being chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **Reaction Identification**: Maleic anhydride (a dienophile) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (a diene). This is a classic Diels-Alder reaction, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition. The reaction is stereospecific and typically yields two diastereomeric products: a major *endo* product and a minor *exo* product. The formation of the *endo* product is kinetically favored due to secondary orbital overlap in the transition state.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Stereochemistry**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The major product is the *endo* adduct. In this context, *endo* refers to the stereoisomer where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the one-carbon bridge (the C7 methylene group). The minor, or *exo*, product has the anhydride ring on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **NMR Analysis (NOESY)**: A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. We must identify which protons are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n    *   **Proton Assignments**:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**: This is one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge, likely the one *syn* to the double bond. It appears as a doublet due to coupling with the other bridge proton.\n\n    *   **Spatial Relationships**:\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the C7 bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *anti* to the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. Instead, they are brought into proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (~1.7 ppm).\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to the resonances at ~3.5 ppm and ~1.5 ppm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is the one that connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants\n\n1.  **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride**: A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are on a double bond.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks: one at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and one at 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (~7.2 ppm) and due to its C₂v symmetry, it has two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **Diene**: The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups at positions C1, C2, C3, and C4. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n### Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride). This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the combination of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction typically yields two stereoisomeric products:\n*   The **major product** is the *endo* adduct, formed via a transition state with stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   The **minor product** is the *exo* adduct, which is often more sterically stable but kinetically disfavored.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Products and their NMR Signals\n\nThe product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton. Key proton groups are:\n*   **H_anhydride**: Two equivalent protons on C2 and C3, originating from maleic anhydride. They appear as a **2H singlet around 3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Me_alkene**: Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5, C6). Vinylic methyl groups typically resonate as a **6H singlet around 1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Me_bridgehead**: Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These alkyl methyls appear as a **6H singlet around 1.0 ppm**.\n*   **H_bridge**: Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They would give two separate 1H signals. The problem describes one of these as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n### Step 4: Differentiate Between *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers using NOESY\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates their spatial proximity. The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This allows us to identify the stereochemistry.\n\n*   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C5=C6 double bond. This geometry places the H_anhydride protons (on C2, C3) pointing away from the double bond and close to the C7 methylene bridge protons (specifically the *anti*-proton) and the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead).\n*   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the double bond. This places the H_anhydride protons pointing towards the double bond, making them close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n\nThe crucial NOE cross-peak, which is present only in the major (*endo*) product, must correspond to a proximity unique to that isomer. The possibilities are:\n1.  **H_anhydride ↔ Me_bridgehead**: An interaction between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm.\n2.  **H_anhydride ↔ H_bridge**: An interaction between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and one of the 1H signals for the bridge protons, given as ~1.5 ppm.\n\nConversely, the NOE between **H_anhydride ↔ Me_alkene** (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) would be characteristic of the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's match the predicted NOEs with the given choices:\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between Me_bridgehead and Me_alkene. The distance between these groups is not expected to differ significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between one of the **H_bridge** protons and the **H_anhydride** protons. This proximity is a key feature of the **endo** isomer. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is an NOE between **Me_bridgehead** and an **H_bridge** proton. This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between **Me_alkene** and **H_anhydride** protons. This proximity is characteristic of the ***exo*** **(minor)** product. Since the cross-peak is observed in the major product, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option describing an NOE interaction that is uniquely present (or significantly stronger) in the major *endo* product is the one between the anhydride protons and a bridge proton.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single 1H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two 13C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single 1H peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift at 7 ppm is in the vinylic/aromatic region.\n        *   Two 13C peaks indicate two types of carbon atoms. 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and 137 ppm is a vinylic carbon deshielded by electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   The only structure that fits these data is **maleic anhydride**. It is derived from maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, resulting in two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition** between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the kinetic product (usually the major product unless the reaction is run under thermodynamic control) is the *endo* adduct. This is because of favorable secondary orbital overlap between the π-system of the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups (the carbonyls) and the developing π-bond in the diene (at C2-C3).\n    *   **Major Product = Endo adduct:** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond of the bicyclic system.\n    *   **Minor Product = Exo adduct:** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY shows through-space correlations between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n4.  **Examine the Structures for Proton Proximity:**\n    *   Let's identify the different types of protons in the product molecule and estimate their chemical shifts:\n        *   **H_anhydride:** Protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (at positions C5 and C6). They are alpha to carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. We expect a **2H singlet** at a downfield position, around **3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_vinyl:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (at C2 and C3). They are equivalent by symmetry. We expect a **6H singlet** for these vinylic methyls, around **1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). They are also equivalent. We expect a **6H singlet** for these tertiary alkyl methyls, typically upfield, around **1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **CH₂_bridge:** The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and should give rise to two signals, likely a pair of doublets (an AB quartet), around **1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   **Proximity in the Major (Endo) Adduct:**\n        *   In the *endo* structure, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C5, C6) very close in space to the **Me_vinyl** protons (at C2, C3). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are far from the CH₂_bridge protons (at C7) as they are on opposite faces of the bicyclic ring system.\n\n    *   **Proximity in the Minor (Exo) Adduct:**\n        *   In the *exo* structure, the anhydride ring points away from the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   The **H_anhydride** protons are now very far from the **Me_vinyl** protons. No significant NOE cross-peak is expected.\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are now on the same face as the C7 bridge, so an NOE between them would be possible.\n\n5.  **Match the Findings with the Options:**\n    *   The differentiating NOE—present in the major product and absent in the minor—is between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n    *   Based on our chemical shift assignments:\n        *   H_anhydride = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   Me_vinyl = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   The cross-peak connects the resonance of the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   This corresponds exactly to option A.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n*   B) Me_bridgehead (~1 ppm) and CH₂_bridge (~1.5 ppm): This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n*   C) Me_bridgehead (~1 ppm) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm): This distance is fixed by the covalent framework and is identical in both isomers.\n*   D) CH₂_bridge (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm): This interaction would be strong in the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with the principles of Diels-Alder stereochemistry and NOESY analysis is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C NMR. This spectroscopic data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinyl protons, giving a single ¹H NMR peak (δ ≈ 7.0 ppm).\n    *   Due to symmetry, it has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, resulting in two ¹³C NMR peaks. The chemical shifts are characteristic for these functional groups.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4).\n    *   There are methyl groups on each of the four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n    *   The fifth carbon of the ring (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   **The Stereochemistry (Endo/Exo Isomers):** Diels-Alder reactions often produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The formation of a major and minor product indicates that both are formed, with one being favored.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** states that the kinetically favored product (usually the major product, especially at lower temperatures) is the *endo* isomer. In this isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *anti* to the shortest bridge of the bicyclic system (the C5-CH₂ group). This orientation allows for favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state.\n    *   The **Exo** isomer is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored (minor) product. Here, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Structure of the Products:** The reaction yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Let's determine the substitution pattern based on the reactants:\n    *   The C1, C2, C3, and C4 atoms of the diene and the two alkene carbons of maleic anhydride form the new six-membered ring.\n    *   The C5-CH₂ group of the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system.\n    *   The C1 and C4 atoms of the diene become the bridgehead carbons. They each carry a methyl group.\n    *   A new double bond forms between C2 and C3 of the diene. These carbons each carry a methyl group.\n    *   The maleic anhydride part is fused to the C5 and C6 positions of the new bicyclic system. These carbons each have a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the sum of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ from the diene and C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride).\n\n**3. Analyze the NMR Spectra and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **Symmetry and ¹H NMR Prediction:** The product molecule (both endo and exo isomers) possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C7-CH₂ bridge and the anhydride oxygen. This simplifies the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, expected around **δ ≈ 1.0 ppm**.\n    2.  **Alkene Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3) are also equivalent. This gives another **6H singlet**. Being on a double bond, their shift will be further downfield, around **δ ≈ 1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Methine Protons:** The two protons on the carbons from the maleic anhydride (C5, C6) are equivalent. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups, so they will be significantly deshielded, around **δ ≈ 3.5 ppm**. Since their neighbors (the bridgehead carbons) have no protons, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    4.  **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the C7-CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic (one *syn* and one *anti* to the C2=C3 double bond) and will likely appear as a complex multiplet or two doublets of doublets, integrating to 2H total. One of these might appear as a doublet around **δ ≈ 1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **NOESY Analysis (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This must arise from a unique spatial relationship in the major (endo) isomer.\n\n    *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the methine protons (from the anhydride, δ ≈ 3.5 ppm) on the same face of the molecule as the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, these methine protons are spatially close to the alkene methyl groups (δ ≈ 1.7 ppm). **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between the methine protons and the alkene methyl protons.**\n\n    *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the methine protons far away from the alkene methyl groups. No NOE is expected between them. Instead, the methine protons are now close to the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The cross-peak that is present only in the major product connects the methine protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n**4. Match with the Options**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   The cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (methine protons) and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (alkene methyls).\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`). This interaction is not unique to the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_alkene`). This interaction is also not unique to the major product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_alkene`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_methine`). This matches our conclusion for the unique NOE in the major (endo) product.**\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_methine`). This interaction is characteristic of the minor (exo) product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying reactants from spectral data, predicting the products and stereochemistry of a Diels-Alder reaction, and interpreting 2D NOESY NMR spectra to distinguish between the stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride (Dienophile):** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data is key to its identification:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is in the alkene (vinylic) region. A single peak means all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates there are only two chemically unique carbon environments.\n    *   The only structure that fits this description (a cyclic anhydride from a *cis*-alkene) and the high symmetry indicated by the NMR data is **maleic anhydride**. It possesses a plane of symmetry that renders its two vinylic protons equivalent (one ¹H signal) and its two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent, respectively (two ¹³C signals).\n\n*   **The Diene:** This is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. When a cyclic diene and dienophile are used, two stereoisomeric products, known as the *endo* and *exo* adducts, are possible.\n*   The **endo rule** of the Diels-Alder reaction predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major product (formed faster, i.e., the kinetic product), while the *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures of the two products:\n    *   **Major Product (Endo Adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same face (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond (the larger bridge with the methyl groups) and on the opposite face (*anti*) of the one-carbon CH₂ bridge. This geometry places the protons on the anhydride part of the molecule spatially close to the protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo Adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same face (*syn*) as the CH₂ bridge and *anti* to the double bond. This geometry places the anhydride protons spatially close to the methyl groups.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the 2D NOESY NMR Data**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR experiment that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (*endo*) isomer. Based on our analysis in Step 2, this unique spatial relationship is the proximity between the **anhydride protons** and the **protons of the CH₂ bridge**. The proximity between the anhydride protons and the methyl groups would be characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\n*   Now we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the product structure. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two of them, and they are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, making them relatively deshielded. They do not have any adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is a very reasonable assignment.\n    *   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** The CH₂ bridge contains two non-equivalent (diastereotopic) protons. They will couple only to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as a pair of doublets. The signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** represents one of these two bridge protons.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. The plane of symmetry makes them fall into two sets of two equivalent methyls. This will give rise to two signals, each integrating to 6H. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** are the signals for these methyl groups.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The unique NOESY cross-peak observed only in the major (*endo*) product must connect the anhydride protons and the CH₂ bridge protons.\n*   Matching our signal assignments:\n    *   Anhydride protons = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   CH₂ bridge proton = **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **The Dienophile (from the dicarboxylic acid):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a highly symmetrical structure, as indicated by its NMR data:\n        *   `1H NMR`: A single peak at 7.0 ppm. This means all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift is in the vinylic region.\n        *   `13C NMR`: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates only two types of carbons are present.\n        *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). The two vinylic protons are equivalent, as are the two vinylic carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n        ```\n            O\n           / \\\n        HC = CH\n        |    |\n       C=O  C=O\n         \\  /\n          O\n        Maleic Anhydride\n        ```\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system.\n\n        ```\n            Me  Me\n             |   |\n           C===C\n          /     \\\n      Me-C       C-Me\n        \\\\     //\n          CH2\n        1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\n        ```\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored and often the **minor product**.\n    *   Let's draw the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The products will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C9H14 (diene) + C4H2O3 (dienophile) = **C13H16O3**, which matches the problem statement.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (C7). The two protons from the maleic anhydride (let's call them H_a) are tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n\n         \n        *In the endo product, the anhydride protons (H_a, in blue) are spatially close to the syn-proton on the C7 bridge (H_syn, in red).*\n\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (C7). The H_a protons are pointing away from the bridge.\n\n         \n        *In the exo product, the anhydride protons (H_a, in blue) are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (in green).*\n\n3.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This cross-peak must correspond to a spatial proximity that exists only, or primarily, in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   Based on the structures above:\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, there is a close proximity between the anhydride protons (**H_a**) and the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge (**H_syn**). A NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, H_a and H_syn are far apart. Instead, H_a are close to the methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak observed in the major product is the one connecting **H_a** and **H_syn**.\n\n4.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option**\n\n    *   We need to match the protons (H_a and H_syn) to the NMR signal descriptions given in the options.\n        *   **Protons from the anhydride (H_a):** These two protons are chemically equivalent and are alpha to the bridgehead carbons, which have no protons. Thus, they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Being alpha to carbonyls in a strained ring, their chemical shift will be downfield, around 3-4 ppm. This matches the **\"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"**.\n        *   **Bridge protons (C7-H):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (*syn* and *anti*). They are coupled only to each other (geminal coupling), so they appear as two separate doublets. The problem mentions **\"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\"**. This is a perfect description for one of these bridge protons (likely H_syn).\n        *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Me_alkene):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at ~1.6-2.0 ppm. This matches the **\"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\"**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a more upfield position, ~1.0-1.5 ppm. This matches the **\"6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm\"**.\n\n    *   The cross-peak in the major product is between H_a and H_syn. This corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This matches our conclusion for the major (*endo*) product.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This would be the characteristic cross-peak for the minor (*exo*) product (H_a <=> Me_alkene).\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls, which is not the key distinguishing feature.\n        *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridgehead methyl and a bridge proton. This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that describes the NOE interaction unique to the major (*endo*) product, which is between the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction:**\n*   The problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The single proton peak corresponds to the two equivalent alkene protons, and the two carbon peaks correspond to the two equivalent alkene carbons and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n*   This anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**2. Determination of the Major and Minor Products:**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   Generally, the *endo* product is favored kinetically due to secondary orbital interactions. However, significant steric hindrance can cause the more sterically stable *exo* product to be favored.\n*   In this specific reaction, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. These groups create substantial steric hindrance, which overrides the normal *endo* preference. Consequently, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Product Structures and NOESY Spectra:**\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically less than 5 Å apart). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) and far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are one pair of equivalent methyl groups. Given their chemical shift, they are likely the methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system (Me_alkene).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** This is the other pair of equivalent methyl groups, located at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity in the Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the one-carbon (CH₂) bridge and toward the C=C double bond. This places the H_anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) in close proximity to the Me_alkene groups (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented toward the CH₂ bridge and away from the C=C double bond. This makes the distance between the H_anhydride protons and the Me_alkene groups large. Thus, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl groups. This corresponds to the resonances at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying the reactants, the reaction type, the products' stereochemistry, and finally interpreting NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Anhydride\n\n*   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n*   The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n*   The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (characteristic of a C=C carbon) and 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl C=O carbon). Two peaks indicate a high degree of symmetry.\n*   These data points unequivocally identify the anhydride as **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), which matches the spectral data. The formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Diene and the Reaction\n\n*   The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene (the cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   The problem states the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. A Diels-Alder reaction is an addition reaction, so the product's formula should be the sum of the reactants' formulas.\n    *   Maleic Anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n    *   Product - Anhydride = Diene Formula\n    *   C₁₃H₁₆O₃ - C₄H₂O₃ = C₉H₁₄\n*   Therefore, the diene must have the formula **C₉H₁₄**.\n*   The named diene \"1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\" could refer to several tautomers. We need to find the C₉H₁₄ isomer that fits. A plausible structure that is a conjugated diene and matches the formula C₉H₁₄ is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene where C5 has two methyl groups (gem-dimethyl), or a similar isomer. However, this leads to an asymmetric product, which complicates the NMR interpretation unnecessarily and contradicts the simplicity of the signals given in the options (e.g., 6H singlets).\n*   A more likely scenario is that there is a typo in the product's molecular formula and it should be **C₁₃H₁₈O₃**. This would result from a diene with the formula **C₉H₁₆**. A highly symmetric C₉H₁₆ tautomer is **2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene**. This diene has a C₂ axis of symmetry. Let's proceed with this assumption as it leads to a symmetric product whose predicted NMR spectra match the data provided in the options.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction of the symmetric diene (2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene) with maleic anhydride yields a symmetric bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. According to the Alder-endo rule, the **endo product is typically the major product** (formed faster), while the *exo* product is the minor one.\n*   **Structure of the Adduct:**\n    *   It has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Four methyl groups: two on the bridgehead carbons and two on the vinylic carbons (of the new double bond). Due to symmetry, these appear as two distinct 6H singlets.\n    *   A CH₂ group forms the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   An anhydride ring is fused to the structure. The two protons on this part of the ring (originating from maleic anhydride) are now on saturated carbons. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and appear as a 2H singlet.\n*   **Stereochemical Difference:**\n    *   In the **endo product (major)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge. This brings the anhydride protons very close in space to the bridge protons.\n    *   In the **exo product (minor)**, the anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the CH₂ bridge. The anhydride protons are far from the bridge protons.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   This diagnostic cross-peak must connect protons that are close only in the *endo* isomer. Based on our structural analysis, this corresponds to the interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **CH₂ bridge protons**.\n*   We need to find the option that describes the resonances for these two groups of protons.\n\n### Step 5: Predict the ¹H NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** These two equivalent protons are on carbons alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. Their chemical shift is expected to be around **~3.5 ppm**. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with (on the main framework), they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (one *syn*, one *anti* to the double bond) and will appear as two distinct signals. They couple to each other (geminal coupling), so each appears as a doublet (or more complex multiplet if other long-range couplings are present). Their chemical shift is typically in the aliphatic region, around **~1.5 ppm**. Each signal integrates to 1H.\n*   The crucial NOESY cross-peak therefore connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** with one of the **1H signals around ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our analysis. The 1H doublet is one of the bridge protons, and the 2H singlet corresponds to the anhydride protons. This cross-peak would be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is a cross-peak between a methyl group and a bridge proton. This interaction would be present in both *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is a cross-peak between a vinylic methyl group and the anhydride protons. This interaction would be stronger in the *exo* (minor) product, which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups. The distance is fixed in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with the principles of the Diels-Alder reaction and NOESY spectroscopy is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Identification of the Reactants\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons, fitting the spectral data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups on the double bond carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition\n\nThe reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Because the reactants are planar, the dienophile can approach the diene from two different faces, leading to two possible diastereomeric products:\n\n*   ***endo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions (kinetic control).\n*   ***exo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7 bridge. This is usually the minor product.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given in the question.\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of Products for NOESY Spectroscopy\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two proton signals indicates their spatial proximity. The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This must correspond to a spatial relationship that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   **In the major (*endo*) product:** The protons from the maleic anhydride part (located at the C2 and C3 positions of the bicyclic system) are on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings them very close to the protons of the CH₂ group at the C7 position. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between the C2/C3 protons and the C7 protons.\n\n*   **In the minor (*exo*) product:** The C2/C3 protons are on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The distance between these protons is much larger, so the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\nThis confirms that the differential cross-peak connects the resonances of the **C2/C3 anhydride protons** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n### 4. Assignment of ¹H NMR Signals\n\nNow, we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the specific protons in the major product.\n\n*   **Protons from the Anhydride (C2-H, C3-H):** These are two equivalent protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift is typically downfield, around 3-4 ppm. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment for these protons. They appear as a singlet due to the plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n\n*   **Protons on the C7 Bridge:** This is a CH₂ group. In the rigid bicyclic system, these two protons are diastereotopic (not chemically equivalent). They couple to each other (geminal coupling), typically resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). One of these protons, the *syn* proton, points towards the C2/C3 positions in the *endo* adduct. This proton is the one that will show the NOE. The question describes one of these signals as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This is a plausible chemical shift for a bridge proton in a bicyclo[2.2.1] system and correctly identifies it as one of the two non-equivalent C7 protons.\n\n*   **Other Signals:**\n    *   **Alkene Methyls (on C5=C6):** These two equivalent methyl groups (6H total) are on a double bond, typically resonating around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (on C1, C4):** These two equivalent methyl groups (6H total) are on saturated carbons. They are more shielded and resonate further upfield, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe key cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product, which is absent in the minor (*exo*) product, connects the anhydride protons (C2-H, C3-H) with the C7 bridge protons. Based on the signal assignments:\n\n*   Anhydride protons = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C7 bridge proton = **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The description is of a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride shows a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high symmetry points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups at all four sp² positions (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the sp³ position (C5).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct with a molecular formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene: C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride: C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the information given.\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n        *   The bridgeheads are the original C1 and C4 of the diene.\n        *   One bridge is the original C2 and C3 of the diene, now a -C(Me)=C(Me)- group.\n        *   The other bridge is the original C5 of the diene, now a -CH₂- group.\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused to the remaining two carbons of the newly formed six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Products**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. A major and minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature for bicyclo[2.2.1] systems, the smaller bridge is the one-carbon (-CH₂-) bridge.\n        *   The **exo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the small (-CH₂-) bridge.\n        *   The **endo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the small bridge, meaning it is *syn* to the larger -C(Me)=C(Me)- bridge.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major kinetic product, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   However, the presence of four bulky methyl groups on the diene creates significant steric hindrance. The *endo* transition state involves a clash between the anhydride's carbonyl groups and the methyl groups on C2 and C3 of the diene. The *exo* transition state is less hindered. In such highly substituted systems, it's possible for sterics to override the electronic preference, making the *exo* product the major one.\n    *   **Key Clue from NMR Data:** The problem provides spectroscopic details that help determine the major product's identity without ambiguity. The protons on the carbons bearing the anhydride functionality are described as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. In bicyclo[2.2.1] systems, *exo* protons often exhibit \"W-coupling\" (a 4-bond coupling) with other protons on the rigid framework, which would split the signal from a singlet. *Endo* protons are typically too far from other protons to show this coupling. The fact that the signal is a **singlet** is strong evidence that these are *endo* protons.\n    *   Therefore, the major product is the **endo adduct**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum of the Major (Endo) Product**\n    *   NOESY cross-peaks indicate protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). We need to find protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n    *   In the **endo adduct** (the major product), the anhydride ring is on the same side as the -C(Me)=C(Me)- bridge.\n    *   This means the two protons on the anhydride-bearing carbons (the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**) are spatially close to the methyl groups on that bridge (the vinyl methyls).\n    *   Let's assign the chemical shifts given in the options:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on the carbons adjacent to the anhydride.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinyl methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Their chemical shift is in the typical range for vinylic methyls.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Bridgehead methyl groups. Their chemical shift is typical for methyls on saturated carbons.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two diastereotopic protons of the -CH₂- bridge.\n\n    *   The key spatial proximity in the major (*endo*) product is between the protons at ~3.5 ppm and the vinyl methyl groups at ~1.7 ppm. This interaction would be absent in the minor (*exo*) product, where the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the molecule.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The major product is the *endo* adduct, as evidenced by the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   In the *endo* adduct, the protons corresponding to the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm are close to the vinyl methyl groups, which correspond to the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects these two resonances.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Anhydride**: A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   The single ¹H NMR peak indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are part of a conjugated and electron-deficient system.\n    *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest two different types of carbon atoms. The peak at ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   These spectral data are perfectly consistent with **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). Due to symmetry, its two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving a single ¹H NMR signal. It has two equivalent carbonyl carbons and two equivalent alkene carbons, giving two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction**: The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition where the cyclopentadiene derivative acts as the diene and maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**: The Diels-Alder reaction typically yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. The reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3, which is the sum of the reactants (Maleic anhydride: C4H2O3; Diene: C9H14). This confirms it is an addition reaction.\n    *   ***Endo* product**: This is generally the major product under kinetic control because of favorable secondary orbital interactions during the transition state. In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the double bond of the bicyclic system.\n    *   ***Exo* product**: This is typically the minor product but is thermodynamically more stable due to less steric hindrance. In this isomer, the anhydride ring points away from the double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Signals and NOESY Correlation**: The question describes a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum of the major product that is absent in the minor product. NOESY cross-peaks indicate that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major product) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor product).\n\n    *   **Proton Assignments in the Product**:\n        *   `H_anhydride`: The two protons originating from maleic anhydride. They are equivalent and appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. They are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyls.\n        *   `Me_bridge`: The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Expected as a **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   `Me_vinyl`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. Expected as a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   `H_bridge`: The two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). They would appear as two separate signals, each a doublet due to geminal coupling. The *anti*-proton (pointing away from the double bond, towards the anhydride in the *endo* case) is typically more shielded (upfield shift) than the *syn*-proton. The signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to the shielded `H_bridge_anti`.\n\n    *   **NOE Analysis in the *Endo* (Major) Isomer**: In the *endo* structure, the anhydride ring is on the *endo* face, \"under\" the rest of the molecule. This brings the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the `H_bridge_anti` proton (~1.5 ppm), which points down from the C7 bridge. Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n    *   **NOE Analysis in the *Exo* (Minor) Isomer**: In the *exo* structure, the anhydride ring is on the *exo* face, pointing away. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far from the `H_bridge_anti` proton. Thus, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: The observation of a strong cross-peak in the major product and its absence in the minor product uniquely corresponds to the spatial interaction between the anhydride protons and the anti-bridge proton.\n\n*   **Matching with Options**: The cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`H_anhydride`) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (`H_bridge_anti`). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The simplest example is maleic acid, which dehydrates to form maleic anhydride. The provided NMR data for the anhydride confirms this structure:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride is a symmetrical molecule (C₄H₂O₃). The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single peak. The given shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons. This results in two peaks. The shifts at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) are consistent with this structure.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   **Product Formula:** The formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction typically yields two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n*   The **endo product** is usually the major product due to kinetic control arising from favorable secondary orbital interactions. In this isomer, the anhydride group is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the bicyclic system. In this specific case, it's *syn* to the C7-methylene bridge.\n*   The **exo product** is the minor product. Here, the anhydride group is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-methylene bridge.\n\nThe problem states a NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n\n### **Step 3: Assign Proton NMR Signals**\nLet's assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the product structure (1,4,5,6-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride).\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them **Hₐ**). They are adjacent to the bridgehead carbons and the carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (**vinylic methyls**). Vinylic methyl protons typically resonate in this region.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (**bridgehead methyls**). These alkyl protons are relatively shielded.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. In norbornene systems, the bridge proton that is *anti* to the double bond is typically found around this chemical shift.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze NOESY Correlations in Endo vs. Exo Isomers**\nNOESY spectroscopy shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In this structure, the **Hₐ** protons are on the same face of the molecule as the C7-bridge. Specifically, they are very close to the *anti* proton of the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between **Hₐ** and this bridge proton.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In this structure, the **Hₐ** protons are on the opposite face of the molecule from the C7-bridge. They are now far away from the C7-bridge protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, the *exo* protons become close to the bridgehead methyl groups (~1.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*endo*) product connects the **Hₐ** protons with the *anti*-C7 bridge proton. Based on our signal assignments, this is a correlation between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the provided chemistry problem about a Diels-Alder reaction and NMR spectroscopy.\n\n    The steps are:\n    1.

This results in a cyclic anhydride.\n    *   ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in a highly deshielded environment, characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only one peak for each type of carbon indicates high symmetry.\n    *   The only structure that fits all these criteria is **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data. Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The other reactant is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's verify its molecular formula. A cyclopentadiene ring has 5 carbons. Four methyl groups (4 x CH₃) are attached. So, the total number of carbons is 5 + 4 = 9.\n    *   The base cyclopentadiene (C₅H₆) has two hydrogens on the CH₂ carbon and one hydrogen on each of the four sp² carbons. In the tetramethyl derivative, the four hydrogens on the sp² carbons are replaced by methyl groups. The CH₂ group remains.\n    *   So, the hydrogens are: 2 (from the CH₂ group) + 4 * 3 (from the methyl groups) = 14 hydrogens.\n    *   The formula for the diene is **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The product is formed by combining the two reactants. C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the **endo product is typically the major product**, and the **exo product is the minor product**.\n\n    *   **Endo Product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (\"syn\") of the newly formed bicyclic system as the double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Exo Product:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (\"anti\") of the bicyclic system from the double bond (C=C).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** A NOESY experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction), even if they are not bonded or coupled. A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are spatially close (typically < 5 Å).\n*   **The Key Information:** A cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   In the **endo isomer (major product)**, the anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the bicyclic framework, placing its two protons (H_anhydride) close to the methyl groups attached to the double bond (Me_vinyl).\n    *   In the **exo isomer (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. Its two protons (H_anhydride) are far from the vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl). Instead, they are close to the CH₂ bridge of the bicyclic system.\n*   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major (endo) product and weak/absent in the minor (exo) product must be between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **Me_vinyl protons**.\n\n**Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nWe need to match the proton groups to the chemical shifts given in the options.\n\n*   **Protons on the anhydride moiety (H_anhydride):** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups, which is a deshielding environment. They are equivalent by symmetry. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinyl):** These are vinylic methyl groups. A typical chemical shift for such groups is in the range of 1.6-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead):** These are methyl groups on saturated, tertiary carbons in a strained ring system. A shift around 1 ppm is reasonable. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Protons on the CH₂ bridge (H_bridge):** These are protons on a saturated carbon in a strained ring. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these two protons (they are non-equivalent).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Cross-Peak**\n\nBased on our analysis, the unique cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the H_anhydride protons with the Me_vinyl protons.\n\n*   Signal for H_anhydride: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Signal for Me_vinyl: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonances at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Options**\n\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_bridge and H_anhydride). This interaction would be strong in the *exo* product, not the *endo*.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Me_bridgehead and H_bridge). This interaction is not the primary differentiator between *endo* and *exo*.\n*   C) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (Me_vinyl and H_anhydride). This matches our conclusion perfectly. This interaction is strong in the *endo* (major) product and weak/absent in the *exo* (minor) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_bridgehead and Me_vinyl). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum (all protons are equivalent) at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (two types of carbons) at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The simplest cis-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check if the NMR data matches maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n            *   ¹H NMR: It has two chemically equivalent protons on the double bond. They would appear as a singlet. A shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons flanked by electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n            *   ¹³C NMR: It has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This leads to two signals. A carbonyl carbon resonance around 165 ppm and a vinyl carbon resonance around 137 ppm are very typical.\n        *   Thus, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is between a diene and a dienophile, which is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n        *   The molecular formula of the product would be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclopentadiene derivative and a cyclic dienophile produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   This reaction can lead to two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n        *   The *endo* product is formed when the dienophile approaches the diene such that its electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) are tucked underneath the diene's π-system. This orientation is favored by secondary orbital overlap and is typically the **kinetically controlled major product**.\n        *   The *exo* product has the anhydride part oriented away from the diene's π-system. It is sterically less hindered and is typically the **thermodynamically controlled product**, often the minor product under standard conditions.\n    *   Since the problem mentions a major and a minor product, it's safe to assume we have formed both the *endo* and *exo* adducts, with the **major product being the *endo* isomer**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   First, let's identify the different types of protons in the product and assign the signals given in the options. The product has a plane of symmetry in both isomers.\n        *   **Vinyl methyls (Me_v):** Two CH₃ groups on the C=C bond. Equivalent by symmetry. (6H total). Vinyl methyl protons typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyls (Me_b):** Two CH₃ groups on the bridgehead carbons. Equivalent by symmetry. (6H total). These are on saturated carbons and should be more shielded than the vinyl methyls. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_a):** Two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. Equivalent by symmetry. (2H total). These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups, making them highly deshielded. Let's assign this to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge protons (CH₂):** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7) are diastereotopic and not equivalent. They would appear as two distinct 1H signals (likely complex multiplets or doublets of doublets). One of these could correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** mentioned in some options.\n\n4.  **Compare Interproton Distances in *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers**\n\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** In the *endo* isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the CH₂ bridge, meaning it is tucked \"underneath\" the newly formed six-membered ring, towards the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Spatial Proximity:** The anhydride protons (**H_a**) are spatially close to the protons on the double bond, which are the **vinyl methyl groups (Me_v)**. A strong NOE cross-peak between H_a and Me_v is expected.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_a) are far from the CH₂ bridge protons. An NOE cross-peak is not expected.\n\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** In the *exo* isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* to the CH₂ bridge, pointing \"away\" from the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Spatial Proximity:** The anhydride protons (**H_a**) are now far from the **vinyl methyl groups (Me_v)**. The NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_a) are now spatially close to the **CH₂ bridge protons**. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n\n5.  **Identify the Differentiating Cross-Peak**\n    *   The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** (*endo*) but **absent in the minor product** (*exo*).\n    *   Based on our analysis, this is the cross-peak between the **anhydride protons (H_a)** and the **vinyl methyl protons (Me_v)**.\n\n6.  **Match the Protons to the NMR Signals in the Options**\n    *   Vinyl methyl protons (Me_v) = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   Anhydride protons (H_a) = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects these two signals.\n\n    This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n    *   Let's review the other options:\n        *   A) Me_b and a bridge proton: This NOE should be present in both isomers.\n        *   B) A bridge proton and H_a: This NOE is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n        *   C) Me_b and Me_v: This NOE should be present in both isomers as they are on adjacent carbons.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a cross-peak unique to the major product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem that involves identifying reactants from spectral data, predicting the outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction, and using 2D NMR spectroscopy to determine the stereochemistry of the products.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Dienophile (Anhydride):**\n    *   The problem describes an anhydride formed from the dehydration of a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent. This is characteristic of the two vinylic protons in maleic anhydride.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) and 137 ppm (alkene carbons), which is also consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Diene:**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n3.  **The Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts. According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* is the minor, thermodynamically favored product.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Product Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **Products:** Both the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products will have the same molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   **¹H NMR Signals:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, we expect:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons on the part of the molecule derived from maleic anhydride.\n        *   Two 1H signals (likely doublets due to geminal coupling) for the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Chemical Shift Assignments (Approximate):**\n        *   Anhydride protons (2H singlet): These protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system. A shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable.\n        *   Vinylic methyls (6H singlet): Methyl groups on a double bond typically appear around 1.7-2.0 ppm.\n        *   Bridgehead methyls (6H singlet): Methyl groups on saturated carbons appear further upfield, ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n        *   Bridge protons (CH₂): These are on a saturated carbon in a bicyclic system, often appearing between 1.0-2.0 ppm. A shift of ~1.5 ppm is plausible for one of them.\n\n5.  **Interpreting the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This is the key to distinguishing the isomers and answering the question. We must find protons that are close in the *endo* (major) isomer but far apart in the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n    *   ***Endo* isomer:** The anhydride part of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the main ring system. This brings the two anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and also close to the *syn* proton of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* isomer:** The anhydride part points \"away\" from the main ring system. This moves the anhydride protons far from the vinylic methyls and the *syn* bridge proton.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present (or much stronger) in the *endo* isomer will be between the anhydride protons and the groups on the same face of the molecule. Both the vinylic methyls and one of the bridge protons are potential candidates.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be a correlation between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. Their relative distance is similar in both isomers.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This describes an interaction between one of the CH₂ bridge protons and the anhydride protons. This is a very strong diagnostic correlation for the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** An interaction between the bridgehead methyls and a CH₂ bridge proton. Their distance is similar in both isomers.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This describes an interaction between the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This correlation would also be present in the *endo* isomer and absent in the *exo*.\n\n7.  **Final Decision (B vs. D):**\n    Both options B and D describe valid NOE correlations that would be present in the *endo* product and absent in the *exo*. However, in many Diels-Alder adducts of this type, the most commonly cited and diagnostically reliable NOE for identifying the *endo* isomer is the one between the anhydride protons and the protons on the bicyclic framework that are held in close proximity, such as the vinylic substituents or the bridge protons. In this specific case, with four methyl groups substituting the diene, the interaction between the anhydride protons and the nearby vinylic methyl groups is a very clear and expected NOE. The chemical shifts provided in option D align perfectly with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This interaction represents a clear spatial proximity between 6 protons and 2 protons, which would result in a significant cross-peak.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the vinylic methyl singlet and the anhydride proton singlet.\n\nFinal check of assignments:\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Vinylic methyl groups.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Anhydride protons.\n\nThese two groups are close in the major (*endo*) product and far apart in the minor (*exo*) product, giving rise to the described NOESY cross-peak.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe reaction described is a classic Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak for its protons (¹H NMR at 7 ppm) and only two peaks for its carbons (¹³C NMR at 137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons). This high degree of symmetry confirms the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the four carbons of the diene system and a CH₂ group at the 5th position.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride yields a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   Due to the \"endo rule\" in Diels-Alder reactions, two stereoisomers are typically formed: the *endo* product (major) and the *exo* product (minor). The endo-isomer is favored because of stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the newly forming double bond of the diene in the transition state.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Analysis and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is observed in the 2D NOESY spectrum of the major product but is absent in the minor product. NOESY shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds. This technique is ideal for distinguishing between *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n    *   Let's analyze the expected proton signals and their spatial relationships in both isomers:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methine protons (CH) on the part of the molecule that came from maleic anhydride. They are alpha to the carbonyl groups, hence their downfield shift.\n        *   **Two 6H singlets at ~1.7 ppm and ~1.0 ppm:** These correspond to the four methyl groups. The two methyl groups on the double bond of the product are vinylic and appear at a lower field (~1.7 ppm). The other two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons and appear at a higher field (~1.0 ppm).\n        *   **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge (the CH₂ group from the original diene). These two protons are non-equivalent. The key to distinguishing the isomers is their proximity to other protons.\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the larger bridge, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 methylene bridge. This geometry brings the methine protons from the anhydride (~3.5 ppm) close to the C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring points away from the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the methine protons from the anhydride are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the methine protons from the anhydride and a C7 bridge proton is expected to be present and strong for the *endo* (major) product and absent or very weak for the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the two sets of protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* configuration. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride methine protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that connects the resonances for the anhydride methine protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and a C7 bridge proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Reaction Analysis\n\nThe reaction described is a classic Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n1.  **Dienophile Identification**: A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid was dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride shows a single proton peak at 7 ppm and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃). The two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two vinylic carbons and the two carbonyl carbons, consistent with the observed NMR spectra.\n\n2.  **Diene Identification**: The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Reaction and Products**: The Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene yields an adduct with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄). Due to the stereochemistry of the cycloaddition, two diastereomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The Diels-Alder reaction is under kinetic control, and secondary orbital overlap stabilizes the *endo* transition state, making the **endo adduct the major product** and the **exo adduct the minor product**.\n\n### NMR and NOESY Analysis\n\nThe question hinges on identifying a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum that is present for the major product but absent for the minor product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5Å).\n\n*   **Major (Endo) Product**: In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride portion of the molecule is situated \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring. This geometry brings the two protons from the original maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_alkane**) very close to the two methyl groups on the double bond (the \"inner\" methyls, **Me_inner**).\n*   **Minor (Exo) Product**: In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride portion is flipped away from the cyclohexene ring. In this arrangement, the **H_alkane** protons are far from the **Me_inner** groups.\n\nTherefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the **H_alkane** protons and the **Me_inner** protons will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent or very weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This is the key distinguishing feature.\n\n### Chemical Shift Predictions\n\nTo match this interaction with the given options, we must predict the signals for these protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n\n1.  **H_alkane protons**: These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups within a strained bicyclic system. They have no adjacent protons to couple with (the bridgehead carbons are quaternary, each bearing a methyl group). Thus, they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their position alpha to two carbonyls places their chemical shift significantly downfield, reasonably at **~3.5 ppm**.\n\n2.  **Me_inner protons**: These are the two methyl groups attached directly to the C=C double bond in the product. They are equivalent by symmetry. Vinylic methyl groups typically resonate in the range of 1.6-2.2 ppm. They would appear as a **6H singlet**. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** is appropriate.\n\n3.  **Other Protons**:\n    *   **Me_outer protons**: The two methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons are on saturated, quaternary centers. They would be a **6H singlet** at a more shielded (upfield) position, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **H_bridge protons**: The two protons on the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic and would likely appear as two distinct **1H doublets** (due to geminal coupling).\n\n### Matching Predictions to Options\n\nWe are looking for the NOESY cross-peak connecting **H_alkane** and **Me_inner**. Based on our predictions:\n\n*   **H_alkane**: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   **Me_inner**: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nThis corresponds directly to option C.\n\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_bridge and H_alkane)\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_outer and Me_inner)\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Me_inner and H_alkane)**\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Me_outer and H_bridge)\n\nThe interaction described in option C is the most characteristic NOE for assigning the *endo* stereochemistry in this type of Diels-Alder adduct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride.\" This describes the conversion of maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n        *   Let's verify its NMR data. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, so the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum (given as 7 ppm). The four carbons are of two types: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, leading to two peaks in the ¹³C spectrum (given as 137 ppm for C=C and 165 ppm for C=O). This confirms the dienophile is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of these four carbons has a methyl group. Position 5 is a CH₂ group. The chemical formula for this diene is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) reacts with the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the product. Adding the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ gives C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem, confirming our reactant structures.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The *endo* product is usually the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored due to secondary orbital overlap). The *exo* product is usually the minor product because it is more stable (thermodynamically favored due to less steric hindrance). The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. We can confidently assign the major product as the *endo* adduct and the minor product as the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the Major (*endo*) and Minor (*exo*) Products**\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. Due to the symmetry of both the diene and the dienophile, the resulting adducts also possess a plane of symmetry. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n    *   There will be four distinct sets of protons in the product, and due to symmetry, all of them should appear as singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        1.  **Alkene Methyl Protons (H_Me_a):** Two methyl groups attached to the newly formed double bond. Total of 6H.\n        2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (H_Me_b):** Two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (where the new C-C bonds formed). Total of 6H.\n        3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_anhydride):** Two protons on the fused anhydride ring. Total of 2H.\n        4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons (H_bridge):** Two protons of the CH₂ bridge from the original cyclopentadiene. Total of 2H.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the bicyclic system, on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. This places the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) in close proximity to the protons of the alkene methyl groups (H_Me_a).\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride ring is on the same side as the CH₂ bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) are far from the alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a) but are close to the bridge methylene protons (H_bridge).\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of J-coupling.\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis in step 3, the pair of protons that fits this description is the **anhydride protons (H_anhydride)** and the **alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a)**. This interaction will be strong in the *endo* product and very weak or absent in the *exo* product.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options to the proton groups we identified.\n        *   A **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This corresponds to the bridgehead methyl protons (H_Me_b). These are on saturated carbons and are expected to be the most shielded (lowest chemical shift).\n        *   A **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to the alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a). Methyl groups on a double bond are deshielded relative to those on saturated carbons, so their shift is higher.\n        *   A **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to the anhydride protons (H_anhydride). These protons are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in a strained ring, which significantly deshields them, resulting in a high chemical shift.\n        *   (The descriptions in options B and C mention a \"1H doublet\", which is inconsistent with the highly symmetric structure of the product where all signals should be singlets. We can disregard these options as likely containing typos or being deliberately incorrect.)\n\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n    *   Using our assignments, this corresponds to the signals at **~3.5 ppm (2H, singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H, singlet)**.\n\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\n    *   Option D perfectly matches the two signals we identified as being spatially close in the major product: the alkene methyl protons (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n**1. Deconstruction of the problem:**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   ¹H NMR: single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift is in the vinylic region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C=C) and 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl C=O). The presence of only two signals indicates high molecular symmetry.\n    *   These spectral data and the formation from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid uniquely identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (hence one ¹H signal) and, by symmetry, two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (hence two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts are characteristic for this compound.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   Formula: C₉H₁₄.\n\n*   **Reaction:** A Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product matches the one given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   The *exo* product is usually the thermodynamically more stable (minor) product as it is sterically less hindered.\n\n*   **Products & Spectroscopy:**\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   A 2D NOESY experiment shows a cross-peak (indicating spatial proximity, < 5Å) in the major product that is absent or very weak in the minor product. We need to identify the protons responsible for this cross-peak.\n\n**2. Structural Analysis of Products:**\n\nThe reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. Let's analyze the proton signals we expect from the product's structure, which possesses a plane of symmetry:\n*   **H_α protons (2H singlet):** These are the two protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. Due to the plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a singlet. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3-4 ppm) as they are adjacent to carbonyl groups. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl, 6H singlet):** These are the methyl groups on the C=C double bond of the product. They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a singlet. Their chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyl groups (~1.5-2.0 ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead, 6H singlet):** These are the methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a singlet. Their shift will be further upfield (~1.0-1.5 ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n*   **Methylene bridge protons (CH₂, two 1H signals):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are not equivalent and should appear as two distinct signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. One of these corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**3. NOESY Analysis (Spatial Proximity):**\n\nWe are looking for protons that are close in space in the *endo* (major) product but far apart in the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (\"syn\" or \"under\") the C=C double bond.\n    *   In this conformation, the **H_α protons** are spatially close to the **Me_vinyl groups**. This will generate a strong NOESY cross-peak.\n    *   The **H_α protons** are also close to the *anti* proton of the CH₂ bridge. This will also generate an NOESY cross-peak.\n\n*   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (\"anti\" or \"above\") of the C=C double bond.\n    *   In this conformation, the **H_α protons** are far from the **Me_vinyl groups**. The NOESY cross-peak will be absent.\n    *   The **H_α protons** are also far from the *anti* proton of the CH₂ bridge. This NOESY cross-peak will also be absent.\n\n**4. Matching Analysis to Options:**\n\nThe question describes a cross-peak present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product. Based on our analysis, two such interactions exist:\n1.  Between **H_α** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n2.  Between **H_α** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and the ***anti*-bridge proton** (~1.5 ppm, 1H doublet).\n\nThese correspond to options B and A, respectively.\n*   **Option B:** A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_α).\n*   **Option A:** A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one of the bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_α).\n\nWhile both cross-peaks are valid markers for the *endo* isomer, the interaction between the H_α protons of the dienophile and the vinylic methyl groups of the diene is the most direct and classic evidence of the *endo* stereochemistry. Furthermore, the NOE signal intensity depends on the number of interacting protons. The interaction in Option B involves a group of 6 protons and a group of 2 protons, which would typically result in a stronger, more prominent cross-peak than the interaction in Option A (1 proton and 2 protons). Therefore, it is the most likely candidate for \"the\" characteristic cross-peak mentioned in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid which, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is provided:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        This data is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. Due to its symmetry, it has only one type of proton and two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**. We can verify the product's molecular formula:\n        *   Maleic anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n        *   Diene: C₉H₁₄\n        *   Product: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the information given.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Products**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions predicts that the major product will be the *endo* adduct, as it is formed through a more stable transition state with secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is *present* in the major product but *absent* (or very weak) in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Compare Spatial Proximity in *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers**\n    *   Let's identify the key symmetrical proton groups in the product:\n        1.  **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n        2.  **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** The six protons of the two methyl groups attached to the double bond (at C2 and C3). They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   Now, let's visualize the structures:\n        *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond. This geometry brings the **anhydride protons** very close to the **vinyl methyl protons**. Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **anhydride protons** are far from the **vinyl methyl protons**. No significant NOESY cross-peak would be observed between them.\n    *   This structural difference explains why the cross-peak is present in the major product and absent in the minor one. The distinguishing cross-peak must be between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n5.  **Assign Chemical Shifts and Identify the Correct Option**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts provided in the options to the identified proton groups:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the **anhydride protons**. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them to a higher chemical shift.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the **vinyl methyl protons**. This chemical shift is typical for methyl groups attached to a double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the signals at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\n    *   Evaluating the given options:\n        *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our analysis. It describes the NOE between the vinyl methyl groups and the anhydride protons, which is characteristic of the *endo* adduct.\n        *   B), C), and D) describe other proton interactions that are either not the key distinguishing feature or would be present in both isomers (like the interaction between the two sets of methyl groups in option D).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** We start with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of this acid gives an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H peak implies the protons are equivalent due to symmetry. A chemical shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons that are highly deshielded by electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride. The peak at 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C). The presence of only two peaks indicates high symmetry.\n        *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data perfectly. So, the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene, locked in the *s-cis* conformation necessary for a Diels-Alder reaction. The reacting carbons are C1 and C4, and the CH₂ group at C5 will become the one-carbon bridge in the product.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   Because the dienophile can approach the cyclic diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products are formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* adduct, where the substituents on the dienophile (in this case, the anhydride ring) are tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major Product (*endo* Adduct):**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n    *   There are methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) and on the alkene carbons (C5, C6).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the C2 and C3 positions.\n    *   In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7 methylene bridge (*syn* orientation).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the anhydride group. This simplifies the NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   Based on the structure and symmetry of the *endo* product, we can predict the ¹H NMR signals and assign the chemical shifts given in the options.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methine protons on the anhydride part of the molecule. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a shielded environment. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 methylene bridge. The other C7 proton would give a separate signal. They are split into doublets by geminal coupling. Let's call this one **H_bridge**.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The question asks for a cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* geometry but far apart in the *exo* geometry.\n    *   Let's compare the key distances in both isomers:\n        *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring and the C7 bridge are on the same side of the molecule (*syn*). Therefore, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring and the C7 bridge are on opposite sides of the molecule (*anti*). Therefore, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. No significant NOE is expected. Conversely, in the *exo* adduct, the H_anhydride protons would be closer to the Me_alkene groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The differentiating cross-peak, which is present only in the major (*endo*) product, must connect the **H_anhydride** protons and one of the **H_bridge** protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene): These groups are too far apart for a significant NOE.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride): This NOE would be characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product, not the major one.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge): This interaction would likely be present in both isomers, so it's not the differentiating peak.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride): This interaction is uniquely strong in the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This high degree of symmetry and the spectral data are characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two equivalent protons on the double bond account for the single ¹H NMR peak, while the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons account for the two ¹³C NMR peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. This structure has methyl groups on the four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a methylene (CH₂) group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition typically produces two diastereomeric products: a major *endo* product and a minor *exo* product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structures:**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The carbons C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons of the product. They each have a methyl group attached.\n    *   The carbons C2 and C3 of the diene form the new double bond in the product. They each have a methyl group attached.\n    *   The maleic anhydride adds across the diene to form the rest of the bicyclic framework.\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in the product, we expect the following ¹H NMR signals:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups.\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (they are next to quaternary bridgehead carbons, so no coupling).\n        *   Two 1H signals for the two non-equivalent protons of the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   A cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   ***Endo* isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the newly formed C=C double bond. This places the anhydride protons (a 2H singlet) in close proximity to the vinylic methyl groups (a 6H singlet).\n    *   ***Exo* isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond. In this orientation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are closer to the C7 methylene bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Assign Resonances and Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The distinctive NOESY correlation in the major (*endo*) product will be between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Let's assign the chemical shifts given in the options based on typical values:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (2H singlet):** These protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (6H singlet):** Methyl groups attached to a double bond typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. **~1.7 ppm** is a good fit.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (6H singlet):** These are on saturated, quaternary carbons and are expected to be more shielded. **~1.0 ppm** is a likely value.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (1H doublets):** The methylene bridge protons in norbornane systems appear around 1.2-1.8 ppm. **~1.5 ppm** fits this range.\n    *   The cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our shift assignments, this corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n\nTherefore, the two resonances connected by the cross-peak in the spectrum of the major product are the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle that requires identifying the reactants and products, understanding the reaction mechanism and its stereochemical outcome, and interpreting NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene containing dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This spectroscopic data is a classic fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent protons on the double bond give a single ¹H peak (in the typical range for vinylic protons), while the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) account for the two peaks in the ¹³C spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction and Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a quintessential **Diels-Alder reaction**, where the cyclopentadiene derivative acts as the diene and maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile. This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction typically forms two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. The formation of major and minor products aligns with this expectation.\n\n3.  **Molecular Formula Discrepancy:** There is a discrepancy between the stated molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) and the formula calculated from the reactants (Maleic Anhydride C₄H₂O₃ + Diene C₉H₁₂ = C₁₃H₁₄O₃). This is likely a typo in the problem statement. The core of the problem relies on the structure of the reactants and the principles of stereochemistry and NMR, so we proceed by assuming the named reactants are correct and the product is C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry and the \"Endo Rule\":** The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a cyclic dienophile usually favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions (the \"endo rule\"). This product forms faster and is known as the kinetic product. However, the *exo* product is often more sterically stable (the thermodynamic product). In this specific case, the diene has two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These methyl groups cause significant steric hindrance with the approaching maleic anhydride in the *endo* transition state. This steric clash can override the electronic preference for the *endo* product, leading to the *exo* product being formed faster and thus becoming the major product.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the NOESY Spectra:** A Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) cross-peak indicates that two protons (or sets of protons) are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. We must therefore identify a proton interaction that is unique to the *exo* adduct (the major product).\n\n    *   In the **exo adduct**, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicyclic system. This geometry brings the protons of the anhydride portion (let's call them **H-c**, a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) close to the vinylic methyl groups (the two methyl groups attached to the double bond).\n    *   In the **endo adduct** (the minor product), the anhydride ring is tucked under the bicyclic system, far from the vinylic methyls. Instead, the anhydride protons would be close to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Assigning the NMR Signals and Identifying the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The two equivalent protons from the maleic anhydride moiety (**H-c**) are expected to appear as a **2H singlet around 3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The product has two sets of methyl groups: two equivalent *vinylic* methyls and two equivalent *bridgehead* methyls. Vinylic methyl groups are typically shifted further downfield (higher ppm) than aliphatic methyls. Therefore, the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is assigned to the vinylic methyls, while another 6H singlet for the bridgehead methyls would be expected at a higher field (e.g., ~1 ppm).\n    *   Since the major product is the *exo* adduct, the distinctive NOESY cross-peak connects the protons that are spatially close in this isomer: the anhydride protons (H-c) and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nThis corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice connects the resonances for the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR (indicating two equivalent vinyl protons) and two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C NMR. This spectroscopic data uniquely identifies the anhydride as maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is known to produce a bicyclic adduct. The total proton count in the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) is 16: 12 from the four methyl groups, 2 from the anhydride moiety, and 2 from the C5 position of the cyclopentadiene, which becomes the C7 bridge in the product.\n\n4.  **Consider Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** The Diels-Alder reaction can lead to two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The \"endo rule\" states that the kinetically favored product, which is typically the major product, is the *endo* isomer. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state.\n\n5.  **Predict Product Structures:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the one-carbon bridge (C7) and underneath the C-C double bond of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. This geometry places the two protons of the anhydride moiety (let's call them H_A) in close spatial proximity to the *syn* methyl groups (the two methyl groups on the same side as the anhydride ring).\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (C7). This moves the anhydride protons (H_A) far away from the methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectra:** A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of through-bond coupling.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present** in the spectrum of the major product but **absent or weak** in the minor product.\n    *   This observation is the key to identifying the interacting protons. The defining stereochemical difference between the *endo* and *exo* products is the distance between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product must be due to the spatial proximity of the anhydride protons (H_A) and the nearby methyl groups.\n\n7.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options:**\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_A):** These two protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They are located on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained bicyclic system, so a chemical shift around 3.5 ppm is expected. They should appear as a 2H singlet.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups, totaling 12 protons. In the *endo* product, they are not all equivalent. The two *syn* methyls are in a different chemical environment than the two *anti* methyls. This leads to two distinct 6H singlets. Typical shifts for methyl groups on a double bond are in the 1-2 ppm range. The options suggest ~1.0 ppm and ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product will connect the signal for the **2H anhydride protons** with the signal for the **6H *syn* methyl protons**.\n    *   Let's examine the choices:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Connects the two different methyl group signals.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Connects a bridge proton with the anhydride protons.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Connects one set of methyl groups with the anhydride protons.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Connects a methyl group with a bridge proton.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Option C is the only one that correctly identifies the interaction between the two equivalent anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and one of the sets of equivalent methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). This interaction is strong in the major *endo* isomer and weak or absent in the minor *exo* isomer, perfectly matching the experimental description.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile (the Anhydride)**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   This anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm is in the alkene region. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR shows one signal in the alkene region (137 ppm, C=C) and one in the carbonyl region (165 ppm, C=O). This means the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   This high degree of symmetry, combined with the starting material being a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, points to **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride:\n            ```\n              O         O\n             //        \\\\\n            C           C\n            |           |\n            HC === CH   O\n            ```\n        *   It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (a singlet at ~7.0 ppm) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (~135 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (~165 ppm). This matches the provided spectral data perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n             C₅H₂\n            /    \\\n         C₄(Me) = C₃(Me)\n           |        |\n         C₁(Me) = C₂(Me)\n        ```\n    *   This is a cyclic diene and will participate in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** product and the ***exo*** product.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product will be the *endo* isomer, formed through a transition state that maximizes secondary orbital overlap. This is the kinetic product. The *exo* isomer is typically the minor product.\n    *   Let's determine the spatial relationships in the *endo* and *exo* products. The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. It has a one-carbon bridge (the -CH₂- group from the diene) and a two-carbon bridge containing a double bond (the -C(Me)=C(Me)- part from the diene).\n    *   ***Endo* product (Major):** In the endo-adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the smaller CH₂ bridge. Consequently, the two protons from the maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_A**) point *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge protons (let's call them **H_B**). Therefore, **in the major product, H_A and H_B are close in space.**\n    *   ***Exo* product (Minor):** In the exo-adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. The anhydride protons (**H_A**) are therefore *anti* to the CH₂ bridge protons (**H_B**). **In the minor product, H_A and H_B are far apart.**\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our analysis in step 3, the pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product and far in the minor (*exo*) product are **H_A** (the anhydride protons) and **H_B** (the methylene bridge protons).\n    *   Therefore, the observed NOESY cross-peak must be between the NMR signals for H_A and H_B.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals**\n    *   We need to match the proton types (H_A and H_B) to the signals described in the options. The major product possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **H_A (Anhydride protons):** These two protons are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They are attached to carbons adjacent to bridgehead carbons and carbonyl groups, so they will be deshielded. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, they will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **H_B (Methylene bridge protons):** These two protons are on a saturated carbon in a strained bicyclic system. A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is typical. Although they are on the same carbon, they are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C bond, one is *anti*) and thus not chemically equivalent. They will couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as a pair of doublets. A signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these two protons.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons (H_A) and the methylene bridge protons (H_B).\n    *   The signal for H_A is a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The signal for one of the H_B protons is a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: These are the two sets of methyl groups. They are not the pair of protons that uniquely defines the *endo* product vs. the *exo* product.\nB) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This corresponds to a methylene bridge proton (H_B) and the anhydride protons (H_A). Their proximity is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product. This is the correct answer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This would be an interaction between a vinyl methyl group and the anhydride protons (H_A). This interaction would be stronger in the minor (*exo*) product.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This would be an interaction between a bridgehead methyl group and a methylene bridge proton. The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride\n\n1.  **Dicarboxylic Acid:** The problem states that a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene was dehydrated to its corresponding anhydride.\n2.  **Anhydride NMR Data:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at ~7 ppm. This chemical shift is typical for protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons). A single peak indicates that all the protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, while a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C). The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry, with all carbonyl carbons being equivalent and all alkene carbons being equivalent.\n3.  **Deduction:** The simplest molecule that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid, which has a *cis*-alkene. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as its two alkene carbons equivalent. Searches confirm the NMR data for maleic anhydride show a single proton resonance around 7 ppm and two carbon resonances around 136.5 ppm and 167.7 ppm.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The identified maleic anhydride (the dienophile) is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n3.  **Product Stoichiometry:** The molecular formula of maleic anhydride is C₄H₂O₃. The molecular formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is C₉H₁₄. The cycloaddition product would have a formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given in the problem.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is usually the major product due to kinetic control, while the *exo* product is the minor, more thermodynamically stable isomer.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the *endo* and *exo* Products\n\nThe reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring system with the anhydride fused to it. The key structural features are:\n*   Two **anhydride protons** on the fused five-membered ring.\n*   Two **vinylic methyl groups** on the double bond of the newly formed six-membered ring.\n*   Two **bridgehead methyl groups**.\n*   Two protons on the **methylene bridge** (the CH₂ group).\n\nThe spatial arrangement of these groups differs between the *endo* and *exo* isomers:\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the bicyclic system, placing its two protons in close proximity to the two *vinylic* methyl groups.\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned away from the bicyclic system, making its protons distant from the *vinylic* methyl groups but closer to the *bridgehead* methyl groups.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectra\n\n1.  **NOESY Principle:** 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å), irrespective of whether they are connected by chemical bonds.\n2.  **Differentiating Isomers:** A cross-peak that is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*) must correspond to a spatial proximity that exists only, or primarily, in the *endo* isomer.\n3.  **Prediction:** Based on the structures, a strong Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is expected between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons** in the *endo* isomer. This interaction would be absent in the *exo* isomer due to the large distance between these groups. Therefore, the cross-peak in question connects these specific proton resonances.\n\n### Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option\n\n1.  **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** These are protons on carbons attached to two carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift is expected to be relatively downfield, around **3.5 ppm**. As they are equivalent, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** Methyl groups attached to a C=C double bond typically resonate around **1.5-2.5 ppm**. Given the options, the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment for the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** Aliphatic methyl groups resonate further upfield, typically around **~1 ppm**. The 6H singlet at ~1 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:** The cross-peak observed in the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. Based on the assignments above, this corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n\n3.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (unclear assignment). Incorrect.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (unclear assignment) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). Incorrect.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). **This matches our deduction.**\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are far apart. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and its products using NMR spectroscopy data.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**:\n    *   **Dienophile**: The description of the anhydride (dehydrated dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene) perfectly matches maleic anhydride. It is symmetrical, so its two alkene protons are equivalent, giving a single ¹H NMR peak (~7 ppm). It has two types of carbons (two alkene C=C and two carbonyl C=O), giving two ¹³C NMR peaks (~137 ppm and ~165 ppm).\n    *   **Diene**: This is explicitly given as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**:\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked under the newly formed ring, is typically the major product due to kinetic favorability (secondary orbital overlap).\n    *   The *exo* product is typically the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Signals**:\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core structure. Let's identify the protons and assign the signals given in the options:\n        *   **Methine Protons (from anhydride)**: These are the two protons on the carbons that were part of the dienophile's double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent. They are in a bicyclic environment and adjacent to carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift would be around 3-4 ppm. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` is the best match.\n        *   **Bridge Protons**: These two protons are on the CH₂ group (C7) that bridges the bicyclic system. They are not equivalent (diastereotopic). One is *syn* (on the same side as the double bond) and one is *anti* (on the opposite side). They would appear as two separate signals, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), resulting in doublets. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n        *   **Methyl Protons**: There are two types of methyl groups. Two are attached to the double bond (~1.7 ppm) and two are at the bridgehead carbons (~1.0 ppm). The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` and `6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm` correspond to these sets of methyl groups.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data**:\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride part is tucked under the ring. This brings the **methine protons** (from the anhydride, ~3.5 ppm) very close to the ***syn*-bridge proton** (on the C7 bridge, ~1.5 ppm).\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride part is pointing away from the ring. The methine protons are now far from the bridge protons.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product will be between the **methine protons** and the ***syn*-bridge proton**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The cross-peak connects the signal for the methine protons (`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`) with the signal for one of the bridge protons (`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`).\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical reaction and NMR data to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and options\n    problem_description = \"\"\"\n    A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride (maleic anhydride).\n    This anhydride was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    This reaction yields a major (endo) and minor (exo) product.\n    A NOESY cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product.\n    The task is to identify which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\",\n        \"B\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\",\n        \"C\": \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\",\n        \"D\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Assign signals to protons in the product structure\n    # The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    ProtonAssignment = collections.namedtuple('ProtonAssignment', ['signal_description', 'proton_identity'])\n    assignments = [\n        ProtonAssignment(\"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\", \"Methine protons from the anhydride part\"),\n        ProtonAssignment(\"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", \"One of the C7 bridge protons\"),\n        ProtonAssignment(\"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\", \"Methyl groups on the C=C double bond\"),\n        ProtonAssignment(\"6H singlet at ~1 ppm\", \"Methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons\")\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry and NOESY data\n    analysis = \"\"\"\n    1.

This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of 7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. The singlet nature for two protons suggests a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks. The peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride. The peak at 137 ppm is in the alkene region. The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest structure fitting this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent alkene protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O carbons and two C=C carbons), matching the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: The diene.**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at positions 1-4, a methyl group on each of these four carbons, and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction type and the structure of the products.**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the dienophile is conserved. Since maleic anhydride is a *cis* dienophile, the anhydride ring will be fused in a *cis* manner to the newly formed six-membered ring.\n*   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The Alder Endo Rule predicts that for kinetic control (the usual condition for Diels-Alder), the **endo adduct is the major product**, and the **exo adduct is the minor product**.\n*   Let's check the molecular formula of the product.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products.**\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C=C double bond of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. In other words, the anhydride ring is on the same side (syn) as the C7 bridge, but more importantly for NOE, the two methine protons at the ring junction are pointing towards the C=C bond.\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C=C double bond. The methine protons at the ring junction are pointing away from the C=C bond.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the key difference in the NOESY spectra.**\n\n*   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's examine the proton environments in the product structure (which has C₂ symmetry):\n    1.  **Vinylic Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond are equivalent.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons are equivalent.\n    3.  **Anhydride Junction Protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm):** The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused are equivalent. Their high chemical shift is due to being alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n*   Now, let's consider the spatial proximities:\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride junction protons (3) are pointing towards the C=C bond and are therefore spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (1). This proximity will result in a clear NOE cross-peak.\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride junction protons (3) are pointing away from the C=C bond and are far from the vinylic methyl groups (1). The NOE interaction will be very weak or absent.\n\n**Step 5: Match the interacting protons with the given options.**\n\n*   The unique cross-peak in the major product connects the **anhydride junction protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n*   Let's evaluate the options:\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This exactly matches our analysis. It describes the interaction between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride junction protons.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The \"1H doublet\" signal is inconsistent with the C₂ symmetric structure of the product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent. Also, the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) are not close to the anhydride junction protons.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This describes an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. These groups are on opposite sides of the bicyclic system and are too far apart for a significant NOE.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: The Anhydride**\n    *   It is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. For a simple alkene, this means the two protons on the double bond are equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (characteristic of an alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only two peaks implies high symmetry.\n    *   The simplest molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is derived from maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a C=C double bond. It has a plane of symmetry that makes the two alkene protons equivalent (¹H NMR peak at ~7.1 ppm) and also makes the two alkene carbons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (two ¹³C NMR peaks at ~136 ppm and ~166 ppm). This perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: The Diene**\n    *   The problem explicitly names it as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the Alder-Woodward rule (or endo rule), the major product under kinetic control (which is usually the case unless the reaction is run at high temperatures for a long time) is the ***endo* adduct**. The ***exo* adduct** is the minor product.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This confirms the reaction stoichiometry.\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that bisects the methylene bridge (C7), the C2=C3 double bond, and the anhydride ring.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon methylene bridge (C7).\n\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon methylene bridge (C7).\n\n### **4. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectra and Analyze the NOESY Data**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY) shows correlations between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak is observed in the major product but not the minor product, meaning we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's identify the different types of protons and their approximate chemical shifts based on the common structure of the products:\n\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on saturated, quaternary carbons (C1, C4). **Signal: ~1.0 ppm, 6H singlet.**\n*   **Vinylic Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). **Signal: ~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet.**\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. **Signal: ~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet.**\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons at the C7 position. They couple to each other, forming a pair of doublets (an AX system). One proton is *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond and the other is *anti*. Due to the anisotropic effect of the double bond, their chemical shifts differ. A reasonable shift for one of these would be **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**.\n\nNow, let's analyze the spatial relationships for each option in the *endo* vs. *exo* isomers:\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**:\n    *   *Endo (Major)*: The anhydride protons are \"under\" the C=C bond, relatively far from the vinylic methyls. NOE would be weak or absent.\n    *   *Exo (Minor)*: The anhydride protons are on the same face as the vinylic methyls. They would be close, giving a strong NOE.\n    *   This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`)**:\n    *   The distance between the bridgehead methyls and the methylene bridge protons is fixed by the rigid bicyclic skeleton and is the same in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. A NOE, if present, would be seen in both spectra.\n\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`)**:\n    *   Similar to B, the distance between these two sets of methyl groups is the same in both isomers. A NOE would be present in both.\n\n*   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**:\n    *   ***Endo (Major)***: The anhydride ring and its protons are on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge. The anhydride protons are very close in space to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge. A strong NOE is expected.\n    *   ***Exo (Minor)***: The anhydride ring and its protons are on the opposite side of the C7 methylene bridge. They are far from the bridge protons. No NOE is expected.\n    *   This pattern perfectly matches the problem's description: a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product is due to the through-space interaction between the anhydride protons and one of the methylene bridge protons. This corresponds to the signals of a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm).\n    *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of alkene protons.\n    *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent alkene protons, which explains the single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum. A typical chemical shift for these protons is around 7 ppm. The ¹³C NMR would show two peaks: one for the two equivalent alkene carbons (~135-137 ppm) and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~160-165 ppm). This perfectly matches the provided data.\n*   **Diene:** The dienophile, maleic anhydride, reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This diene has four methyl groups on the conjugated double bonds and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n*   The reaction between a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) and a cyclic dienophile (maleic anhydride) results in a bicyclic product. Specifically, it forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Two diastereomeric products, *endo* and *exo*, can be formed. Typically, the *endo* product is the major product because it is formed faster (kinetic control), while the *exo* product is more stable but forms more slowly (thermodynamic control). The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to the *endo* and *exo* adducts, respectively.\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Products and their NMR Spectra**\n\nLet's break down the structure of the resulting bicyclic adduct and predict its ¹H NMR signals:\n\n*   **Protons from the Anhydride (H_anhydride):** These are two methine (C-H) protons on the anhydride portion of the new bicyclic system. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring, typically resonating around 3.2-3.5 ppm. Since they have no adjacent proton neighbors, they appear as a **2H singlet**. This signal is described in options A and D as a \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\"\n*   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of methyl groups from the diene:\n    *   Two methyl groups on the newly formed double bond (Me_alkene). These 6 protons would appear as a singlet around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead). These 6 protons would appear as a singlet at a more upfield position, around 1.0 ppm.\n*   **Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** These are the two protons from the CH₂ group of the original diene, which now form the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system. These two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments). One is *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond, and the other is *anti* (on the opposite side).\n    *   They couple to each other, forming two separate signals, each a **doublet**. This is often called an AB quartet.\n    *   The *syn* proton is shielded by the π-electron cloud of the double bond and appears more upfield.\n    *   The *anti* proton is not shielded and appears more downfield. Its chemical shift is typically around 1.5 ppm.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The key difference between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products is the spatial arrangement of the anhydride ring.\n    *   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings the **H_anhydride protons** close to the **anti-proton of the C7 bridge (H_anti)**. Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak will be absent or very weak.\n\n### **Step 5: Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the distinguishing cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons with the **H_anti** proton of the bridge.\n\n*   **H_anhydride Signal:** A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n*   **H_anti Signal:** A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\nThis combination precisely matches option A.\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This correctly identifies the correlation between the C7-bridge *anti*-proton and the *endo*-anhydride protons.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be a correlation between the two different sets of methyl groups, which is unlikely to be the primary distinguishing feature between *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This suggests a correlation between a bridgehead methyl group and a bridge proton. While possible, the H_anhydride-H_anti correlation is the classic and most definitive NOE for distinguishing these isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This suggests a correlation between an alkene methyl group and the anhydride protons, which are spatially distant in the *endo* isomer.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance for the *anti*-proton on the C7 bridge with the resonance for the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThe reaction described is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative and can result in two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Its high symmetry results in a single proton signal (~7 ppm) and two carbon signals (~137 ppm for the alkene carbons and ~165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons), which matches the problem description.\n    *   **Diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n    *   **Product:** The molecular formula of the adduct is C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n2.  **Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction typically favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions (Alder's Endo Rule).\n    *   However, when significant steric hindrance is present, the *exo* product, which is thermodynamically more stable, can become the major product. The diene used here has four methyl groups, two of which are at the reacting bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These methyl groups create substantial steric repulsion in the more compact *endo* transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Proton NMR Signals and Structure:**\n    *   The problem describes four key sets of protons in the products:\n        *   A 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm): These are the four methyl groups attached to the double bond (Me(alkene)). Their chemical shift is in the typical range for vinylic methyls.\n        *   A 6H singlet (~1 ppm): These are the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me(BH)). They are more shielded and thus appear at a higher field (lower ppm).\n        *   A 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm): These are the two equivalent protons on the succinic anhydride part of the molecule (H(anhydride)). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   A 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm): This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). Bridge protons typically appear in this region, and the coupling arises from geminal interaction with the other bridge proton.\n\n4.  **NOESY Analysis:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5Å). We need to find a proton-proton interaction that exists in the major (*exo*) product but not in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   **In the major (*exo*) adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented *exo* (away from the C7 bridge). This places the anhydride protons (H(anhydride)) in an *endo* position, pointing \"under\" the main ring system and towards the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the *endo*-oriented H(anhydride) protons are very close in space to the *anti*-proton of the C7 bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n    *   **In the minor (*endo*) adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented *endo* (towards the C7 bridge). This places the anhydride protons (H(anhydride)) in an *exo* position, pointing away from the C7 bridge. The distance between the H(anhydride) and the bridge protons is large, so the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) and absent in the minor product (*endo*) connects the anhydride protons with one of the bridge protons.\n    *   Based on the chemical shifts provided in the options, this corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H(anhydride)) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge).\n\nTherefore, the two resonances connected by the differentiating cross-peak are the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high symmetry (two equivalent alkene protons, two equivalent alkene carbons, two equivalent carbonyl carbons) and the spectral data are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. In this molecule, the four carbons of the diene system (C1-C4) each bear a methyl group, and C5 is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   Since the dienophile can approach the diene from two different faces, two diastereomeric products are formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored and often the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Products and Proton Assignments:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core with the following substituents:\n        *   Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Being on saturated carbons, they will be upfield, around **~1 ppm**.\n        *   Two methyl groups on the double bond (C5 and C6). These are also equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Vinyl methyl groups are deshielded compared to alkyl methyls, so their shift will be around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   Two protons on the fused anhydride ring (at C2 and C3). These protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and located on the rigid bicyclic system, placing their chemical shift downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   Two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. These are diastereotopic and will give rise to two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled only to each other (geminal coupling), so they would appear as two doublets (or an AB quartet). The chemical shift for these is typically around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C5=C6 double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinyl methyl groups (the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C5=C6 double bond. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is now much larger, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak will be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The specific NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Matching this with the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton).\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls).\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile (the Anhydride)**\n\n1.  The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. This suggests a cyclic anhydride is formed from a starting material like maleic acid or a substituted maleic acid.\n2.  The spectral data for the anhydride is key:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Two peaks imply only two types of carbon atoms are present due to symmetry. 137 ppm is in the alkene (C=C) region, and 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride.\n3.  Let's evaluate potential structures:\n    *   **Maleic anhydride:** Formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). It's a cyclic five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and two C=O groups. It has two equivalent vinyl protons and possesses a plane of symmetry, resulting in one signal in the ¹H NMR. It also has two equivalent vinyl carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, giving two signals in the ¹³C NMR. The chemical shifts match the provided data perfectly.\n    *   **Substituted maleic anhydrides:** For example, citraconic anhydride (from methylmaleic acid) would have a methyl signal and a vinyl proton signal, not a single peak. Dimethylmaleic anhydride would have a methyl signal but no signal at 7 ppm.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The anhydride is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene and the Reaction Type**\n\n1.  The anhydride reacts with \"1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\".\n2.  The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n3.  Let's check the molecular formula balance:\n    *   Maleic anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n    *   Product: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n    *   Diene = Product - Anhydride = (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) - (C₄H₂O₃) = C₉H₁₄.\n4.  The formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (a C₅ ring with four CH₃ groups and a CH₂ group) is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₉H₁₄. This confirms the identity of the reactants.\n5.  The reaction between a conjugated diene (the cyclopentadiene derivative) and an alkene (the dienophile, maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct.\n6.  Diels-Alder reactions typically yield two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers. The *endo* product is usually the major kinetic product.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product and its Symmetry**\n\n1.  The Diels-Alder reaction occurs between the C1=C2-C3=C4 system of the diene and the C=C bond of the maleic anhydride. This forms a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative.\n2.  There's a contradiction: the named diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene, is chiral. A reaction between a chiral diene and an achiral dienophile would produce a chiral product, which would have an asymmetric ¹H NMR spectrum (e.g., four distinct methyl signals).\n3.  However, the options provided in the question strongly imply a high degree of symmetry in the product. For example, the presence of \"6H singlet\" signals means two methyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n4.  This implies that the product molecule must have a plane of symmetry. This can only happen if the diene that reacted was symmetric. It's a known issue that tetramethylcyclopentadiene isomers can interconvert, and the problem may contain a simplification or error in the diene's name. We must deduce the structure from the product's implied symmetry.\n5.  A symmetric product structure consistent with the reactants and reaction type would be a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene system with:\n    *   A C=C double bond at positions 2 and 3, each bearing a methyl group (**vinylic methyls**).\n    *   Bridgehead carbons at positions 1 and 4, each bearing a methyl group (**bridgehead methyls**).\n    *   A methylene (CH₂) bridge at position 7.\n    *   The anhydride ring fused at positions 5 and 6, with the two protons from maleic anhydride now attached here (**Ha**).\n6.  This structure possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. Due to this symmetry:\n    *   The two vinylic methyl groups are equivalent (one 6H signal).\n    *   The two bridgehead methyl groups are equivalent (one 6H signal).\n    *   The two anhydride-protons (Ha) are equivalent (one 2H signal).\n    *   The two protons on the C7 bridge are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic: one *syn* and one *anti* to the double bond).\n\n**Step 4: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n1.  Let's assign the signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the protons (Ha) on the anhydride moiety (C5/C6), deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups and the strained ring system.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This shift is typical for vinylic methyl groups. These are the methyls on the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This shift is typical for shielded alkyl methyl groups on a bicyclic frame. These are the bridgehead methyls.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This represents one of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n2.  NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product.\n    *   Major product = *endo* isomer.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* isomer.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n3.  Let's analyze the spatial proximities in the *endo* vs. *exo* isomers:\n    *   **Endo isomer:** The anhydride ring (with protons Ha) is tucked \"under\" the main bicyclic framework, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo isomer:** The anhydride ring points \"away\" from the framework, on the opposite side (*anti*) to the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  Consider the key distances:\n    *   **Ha ↔ Vinylic Methyls:** In the *endo* isomer, the Ha protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. In the *exo* isomer, they are far apart. **This is a potential distinguishing NOE.**\n    *   **Ha ↔ C7 bridge protons:** In the *endo* isomer, the Ha protons are close to the *syn*-C7 proton. In the *exo* isomer, they are far from both C7 protons. **This is also a potential distinguishing NOE.**\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls ↔ other protons:** The distances from the bridgehead methyls to most other protons are similar in both isomers. These NOEs would not be distinguishing.\n\n5.  We are left with two possibilities for the distinguishing cross-peak:\n    *   Between Ha (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm) and the Vinylic Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Between Ha (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm) and a C7 proton (1H doublet, ~1.5 ppm).\n\n6.  Matching these possibilities with the options:\n    *   Option A matches the Ha ↔ Vinylic Methyls interaction.\n    *   Option B matches the Ha ↔ C7 proton interaction.\n\n7.  To choose between A and B: The NOE effect that distinguishes the *endo* isomer is a direct consequence of the secondary orbital interactions that stabilize its transition state, which involves the dienophile's activating groups (the anhydride) and the diene's π-system. This points to the proximity between the anhydride part and the newly forming double bond part of the structure. The NOE between the anhydride protons (Ha) and the vinylic methyls is a direct reporter of this proximity. Furthermore, an interaction between a 2H group and a 6H group is likely to be a very prominent and defining feature of the NOESY spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and the 6H singlet of the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR (one for the vinylic carbons, one for the carbonyl carbons). This information points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   ¹H NMR: The two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's C₂v symmetry, resulting in a single peak. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a double bond conjugated to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: The two vinylic carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, leading to just two signals.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically form bicyclic products and can result in two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n\n3.  **Predict the Major and Minor Products (Stereoselectivity):**\n    *   The \"endo rule\" for Diels-Alder reactions predicts that the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile will be oriented \"under\" the newly forming ring system in the transition state, leading to the *endo* product as the major kinetic product. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this specific case, the diene has methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. In an *endo* approach, these methyl groups would sterically clash with the incoming maleic anhydride. In an *exo* approach, the anhydride approaches from the opposite side, avoiding this clash.\n    *   Therefore, due to severe steric hindrance, the *exo* pathway is favored. The **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NOESY Data:**\n    *   The NOESY technique in NMR spectroscopy reveals protons that are close in space (through-space interaction), regardless of their bonding connectivity. A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially near each other (< ~5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or very weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major product) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor product).\n\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This brings the protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) very close to the protons of the C7 bridge (H_bridge).\n\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) to the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the H_anhydride protons are far from the H_bridge protons. Instead, they are relatively close to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n    *   Conclusion: The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product must be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals from the Options:**\n    *   We need to assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These are two equivalent protons (due to a plane of symmetry in the product) on carbons attached to carbonyl groups. They are methine protons (CH) in a bicyclic system. They will be a **2H singlet** and should appear at a relatively downfield (deshielded) position. The value **~3.5 ppm** is a very reasonable chemical shift for these protons.\n    *   **H_bridge:** These are the two protons on the C7-CH₂ group. They are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments) and will have different chemical shifts. They are coupled to each other (geminal coupling), so each should appear as a **doublet** (assuming no other significant long-range couplings). A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is typical for protons on a saturated bicyclic bridge. The option refers to a **1H doublet**, which correctly describes the signal for one of these two protons.\n    *   **Methyl groups:** There are two types of methyl groups: two on the vinylic carbons (C2, C3) and two on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). We would expect two 6H singlets, one around ~1.7 ppm (vinylic) and one around ~1.0 ppm (alkyl/bridgehead).\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis to the Given Options:**\n    *   We are looking for a cross-peak connecting H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and one of the H_bridge protons (~1.5 ppm, 1H doublet).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This perfectly matches our deduction. It describes the NOE between a C7 bridge proton and the anhydride protons, which is characteristic of the major *exo* product.\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This would be an NOE between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which are far apart in the *exo* structure.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This is an NOE between the two different types of methyl groups. This is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique distinguishing feature.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This is an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and a C7 bridge proton. This proximity exists in both isomers and is not the unique distinguishing feature.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that describes the unique spatial proximity in the major (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile (Anhydride):** The starting material is a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid that forms an anhydride upon dehydration. The resulting anhydride exhibits high symmetry, as indicated by its NMR spectra:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. The downfield shift is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). A single peak means these protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Only two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This means all alkene carbons are equivalent, and all carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is a five-membered ring formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two pairs of carbons equivalent.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition (a Diels-Alder reaction) between the diene and the dienophile. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   When a cyclic diene reacts, two stereoisomeric products can form: an *endo* product and an *exo* product.\n*   The **Alder Endo Rule** predicts that the major product, formed under kinetic control, will be the ***endo* adduct**. The minor product will be the thermodynamically more stable ***exo* adduct**.\n*   The problem confirms this by stating that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of the Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   We must determine the spatial arrangement of the protons in both the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products to understand the NOESY spectrum.\n*   Let's label the protons from the maleic anhydride part of the molecule as **H_A**. These are the protons responsible for the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** in the product's spectrum (they are deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups). The protons on the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclic system correspond to signals around **1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same face) to the longer bridge of the bicyclic system (the C5=C6 double bond bridge). This geometry forces the two **H_A** protons into the ***exo*** position. In this *exo* position, the H_A protons are pointing towards the C7 methylene bridge. This results in a short spatial distance between the H_A protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C5=C6 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_A** protons into the ***endo*** position. In this *endo* position, the H_A protons point away from the C7 bridge and towards the C5=C6 double bond. The spatial distance between the H_A protons and the C7 bridge protons is now large.\n\n**4. Interpretation of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A NOESY spectrum shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   From our structural analysis, we concluded that the short distance between the **H_A protons (~3.5 ppm)** and the **C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm)** exists *only* in the major (*endo*) product. In the minor (*exo*) product, these protons are far apart.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that appears for the major product but not the minor is the one that connects the resonances for the H_A protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe resonances connected by this distinguishing cross-peak are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (from the H_A protons) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (from a C7 bridge proton). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Dienophile Formation:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is provided: ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** This anhydride (the dienophile) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) to form two products (major and minor).\n    *   **Product Information:** Both products have the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n    *   **Spectroscopy:** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows a key difference: a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product.\n    *   **Question:** Identify the two resonances connected by this cross-peak in the major product, given a list of signals and their integrals.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Identify the Dienophile**\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid that dehydrates to an anhydride is maleic acid. The resulting anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data against the structure of maleic anhydride:\n        *   **Structure:** It's a five-membered ring with two carbonyls and a C=C double bond. It has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** The two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They are deshielded by the double bond and the adjacent carbonyl groups. A single peak around 7 ppm is expected. This matches the data.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C). This means two signals are expected. Carbonyl carbons typically appear around 160-180 ppm, and alkene carbons around 100-150 ppm. The given signals (165 ppm and 137 ppm) perfectly match this expectation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The dienophile is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder, which is a cycloaddition. We can determine the molecular formula of the diene by subtracting the dienophile's formula from the product's formula.\n    *   Product: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n    *   Dienophile: - C₄H₂O₃\n    *   Diene: = C₉H₁₄O₀ -> **C₉H₁₄**\n    *   The Python code query confirmed this calculation.\n    *   The diene is named \"1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\". However, the product NMR data suggests a highly symmetrical structure (two different 6H singlets). For the product to be symmetrical, the starting diene must also be symmetrical.\n    *   A standard 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is not symmetrical. A more plausible and symmetrical isomer that fits the C₉H₁₄ formula is **2,3,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This diene possesses a plane of symmetry. Let's assume this is the actual diene used, as it's the only one that logically leads to the product's simple NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Products and Assign NMR Signals**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between the symmetrical diene (2,3,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and symmetrical maleic anhydride will produce a symmetrical bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct. According to the \"endo rule,\" the *endo* product is usually the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   Let's analyze the protons in the symmetrical product structure:\n        *   **Bridge Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the C7 bridge (originating from C5 of the diene) are equivalent due to symmetry. They are on a saturated, strained bridge and are expected to be shielded (low ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinyl Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond of the newly formed six-membered ring (originating from C2 and C3 of the diene) are also equivalent. They are vinylic and less shielded. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons that came from the maleic anhydride are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and on the bicyclic framework, making them deshielded. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Cross-Peak**\n    *   The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is a through-space interaction. A cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum connects protons that are physically close to each other (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The presence of a cross-peak in the major product but not the minor one is the key to identifying the stereochemistry and answering the question.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the cyclohexene ring system. This geometry places the anhydride protons (2H at ~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the vinyl methyl groups (6H at ~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between these two sets of protons is expected.\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the double bond. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is large. Therefore, no significant NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n    *   This observation confirms that the major product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The cross-peak observed in the spectrum of the major product must connect the two resonances that are brought into close spatial proximity in the *endo* configuration. These are:\n    *   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (from the vinyl methyl groups).\n    *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (from the anhydride protons).\n    This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere's a breakdown of the chemical problem to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Anhydride:** The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) perfectly matches that of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent alkene protons give a single peak, and the two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons) give two peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group is at carbon 5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic product.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: an *endo* product and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically formed faster and is therefore the major (kinetic) product. In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the bridge containing the newly formed double bond.\n    *   The *exo* product is typically more stable but forms slower, making it the minor (thermodynamic) product. Here, the anhydride ring points away from the bridge.\n    *   The problem states a major and minor product are formed, which corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Product Structure and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **Structure:** The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Both the *endo* and *exo* products have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **¹H NMR Signals:**\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (H-A):** The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused (carbons 2 and 3) are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They are described as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. The lack of splitting is common in such bicyclic systems.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (H-Me):** The four methyl groups are in two different chemical environments. The methyl groups at the bridgehead (carbons 1 and 4) are equivalent to each other, and the methyl groups on the double bond (carbons 5 and 6) are equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct **6H singlets**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (H-B):** The methylene bridge (carbon 7) has two protons that are not equivalent and would likely appear as doublets. The problem mentions a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", which corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The key structural difference between the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products is the spatial relationship between the anhydride protons (H-A) and the methyl groups.\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond bridge. This brings the anhydride protons (H-A, at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the *syn* methyl groups on the double bond (one of the 6H singlets).\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride ring points away, making the distance between the anhydride protons and all methyl groups much larger.\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor one. This specific cross-peak must be due to the proximity of protons unique to the *endo* geometry.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and one set of methyl protons (a 6H singlet).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the differentiating NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product is between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 6H singlet from the nearby methyl groups.\n    *   Option A matches this prediction perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid Anhydride:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid was dehydrated to form an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the alkene region.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n    *   This data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃). Due to its C₂v symmetry, it has only one type of proton and two types of carbons, matching the spectral data.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring where the four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) are replaced by methyl groups. The C5 position remains a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n### **Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. It can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo product is typically the major product** due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the transition state.\n    *   The **exo product is the minor product**.\n\n### **Step 3: Structure and ¹H NMR Signal Assignment of the Products**\n\nLet's analyze the expected proton signals for the product:\n*   **Vinylic Methyls (6H):** The double bond in the product is between the original C2 and C3 of the diene. The two methyl groups on these carbons become vinylic. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry and should appear as a 6H singlet around 1.7–2.0 ppm.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls (6H):** The methyl groups on the original C1 and C4 of the diene are now on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent and should appear as a 6H singlet at a higher field, around 1.0–1.5 ppm.\n*   **Anhydride Protons (2H):** The two protons on the carbons from the maleic anhydride (let's call them H-anhydride) are equivalent. They should appear as a 2H singlet, likely deshielded by the anhydride group, around 3.5 ppm.\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons (2H):** The two protons of the CH₂ group (C7 bridge) are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are expected to be non-equivalent and appear as two separate signals, likely doublets due to coupling with each other. A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is reasonable for one of these protons.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Spectra to Distinguish *Endo* and *Exo* Products**\n\nNOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons. The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor one.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the **H-anhydride protons** (on C5/C6) are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are relatively close to the *syn* proton of the C7-CH₂ bridge and also relatively close to the bridgehead methyl groups. However, a defining feature often used to distinguish endo/exo isomers is the interaction between protons on the dienophile part and protons on the diene part. Specifically, in the *endo* adduct, the **H-anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This moves the H-anhydride protons away from the vinylic methyl groups, making their NOE interaction absent or very weak. Instead, in the exo-adduct, the H-anhydride protons become closer to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n### **Step 5: Correlate NOESY Data with the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a NOESY cross-peak present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This corresponds to an interaction unique or much stronger in the *endo* isomer. The key spatial proximity in the *endo* adduct that is lost in the *exo* adduct is between the anhydride protons and the substituents on the newly formed double bond.\n\nLet's re-examine the options based on our assignments:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Bridgehead Methyls**) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Vinylic Methyls**). These two sets of methyl groups are relatively far apart in both isomers.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Bridgehead Methyls**) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**C7 Bridge Proton**). This interaction might exist but is not the most distinctive difference between the isomers.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Vinylic Methyls**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**H-anhydride**). As determined above, the H-anhydride protons are close to the vinylic methyl groups in the major *endo* product, but far from them in the minor *exo* product. This matches the problem description perfectly.\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**C7 Bridge Proton**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**H-anhydride**). These protons would be closer in the *exo* adduct, which is the minor product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major product's spectrum and absent in the minor product's spectrum connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction sequence and the interpretation of NMR spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the products.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reactants\n\n1.  **The Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm, indicating two distinct types of carbon atoms.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**.\n    *   Let's check if the NMR data match maleic anhydride:\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride has two protons on the double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these protons are equivalent and appear as a single peak. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** The molecule has two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=C). This leads to two signals. The signal at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbons, and the signal at ~137 ppm corresponds to the vinylic carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is indeed maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **The Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene.\n\n### Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), which matches the information given.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo adduct** is typically the major product formed under kinetic control, which is common for Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   The **exo adduct** is the more stable thermodynamic product and is typically the minor product.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n\n*   A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (typically less than 5 Å apart).\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n\n### Step 4: Structural Analysis of the *Endo* and *Exo* Adducts\n\nLet's assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the product structure:\n*   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. They are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal, along with its coupling partner (not explicitly described as a distinct option), corresponds to the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge. Let's call them **H_bridge**.\n\nNow, let's examine the 3D structures:\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the C=C bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons (at ~3.5 ppm) point towards the CH₂ bridge. This brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the CH₂ bridge (one of the protons resonating around ~1.5 ppm).\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons point toward the C=C double bond, bringing them close to the **Me_vinyl** groups (at ~1.7 ppm). They are far from the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cross-peak that is unique to the **major (*endo*) product** must be due to the spatial proximity between the **H_anhydride** protons and one of the **H_bridge** protons. Based on the provided chemical shifts, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\nThis matches option C. The interaction described in option D (between the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) would be expected in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n\nThe correct choice is therefore the one that describes the NOE correlation between the protons on the anhydride part of the molecule and the protons on the CH₂ bridge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reactants\n\n1.  **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is provided:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The 7 ppm chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are deshielded by electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This indicates a high degree of symmetry, with only two distinct carbon environments.\n    *   This spectroscopic data uniquely identifies the anhydride as **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid) and has the required symmetry. The molecular formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n2.  **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated C=C-C=C system. There are methyl groups on each of the four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, and C4). The C5 position is a CH₂ group. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n### Step 2: The Diels-Alder Reaction and Its Products\n\n*   The reaction between the diene and the dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative and can yield two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n### Step 3: Stereochemistry - Which is the Major Product?\n\n*   The **Alder Endo Rule** predicts that the *endo* product is typically favored due to secondary orbital interactions, making it the major kinetic product.\n*   However, the diene in this reaction is heavily substituted with four bulky methyl groups, two of which are on the carbons that become the bridgeheads (C1 and C4). This creates significant steric hindrance in the transition state leading to the *endo* product.\n*   In cases of severe steric hindrance, the rule can be overridden, and the less hindered *exo* product becomes the major product. Given the substitution pattern, it is chemically sound to conclude that the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor one.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) reveals protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of these spatially close protons.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor one. Based on our analysis in Step 3, we must find a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo adduct**.\n\nLet's analyze the spatial relationships in both isomers:\n*   **Exo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them **H_anhydride**) on the same face as the C=C double bond. This geometry brings the H_anhydride protons very close to the **vinylic methyl groups**. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these signals.\n*   **Endo Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite face of the C=C double bond. The H_anhydride protons are now far from the vinylic methyl groups, and the NOESY cross-peak would be absent. Instead, in the *endo* adduct, the H_anhydride protons are close to the C7-CH₂ bridge protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak unique to the major (*exo*) product connects the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n### Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Answer\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These are two equivalent protons alpha to two carbonyl groups. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** These two equivalent methyls on saturated carbons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge Protons:** The signal for one of the C7 bridge protons is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThe cross-peak in the major product connects the H_anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This is the classic preparation of maleic anhydride from maleic acid.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   ¹H NMR: The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, so they appear as a single peak. The given shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of these protons.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This matches the given data of two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Products of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond (or more accurately, tucked under the diene system in the transition state). This is typically the major, kinetically-favored product.\n*   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the double bond. This is typically the minor, thermodynamically-favored product.\n\nThe problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* isomers. The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Assign ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the adducts. They have a plane of symmetry passing through the anhydride oxygen, the C=C bond, and the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Proton Types:**\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift is typically low for aliphatic methyls, ~1.0 ppm.\n    2.  **Alkene Methyls:** Four methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Being attached to sp² carbons, they are more deshielded than the bridgehead methyls, ~1.7 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** Two protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are equivalent by symmetry and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Signal: **2H singlet**. They are alpha to carbonyl groups, so they are deshielded, ~3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They couple to each other, forming an AB quartet (two doublets). The *anti* proton is typically less shielded than the *syn* proton. The problem describes one of these as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which we can assign to the *anti* proton (H_anti).\n\n*   **Summary of Signal Assignments:**\n    *   ~1.0 ppm: 6H singlet (Bridgehead -CH₃)\n    *   ~1.7 ppm: 6H singlet (Alkene -CH₃)\n    *   ~3.5 ppm: 2H singlet (Anhydride H_a)\n    *   ~1.5 ppm: 1H doublet (Bridge H_anti)\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers**\n\nNOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find which pair of protons fits this description.\n\n*   **Major Product (Endo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C7 bridge. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *exo* position (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   The methylene bridge has two protons: H_syn (pointing towards the double bond) and H_anti (pointing away from the double bond).\n    *   Crucially, in the *endo* isomer, both the anhydride protons (H_a) and the bridge proton (H_anti) are on the *exo* face of the molecule. They are spatially close.\n    *   **Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between H_a (~3.5 ppm) and H_anti (~1.5 ppm) is expected for the major (endo) product.**\n\n*   **Minor Product (Exo Isomer):**\n    *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the *exo* face. This places the anhydride protons (H_a) in the *endo* position (pointing towards the double bond).\n    *   The bridge proton H_anti is still on the *exo* face.\n    *   In this isomer, H_a (*endo*) and H_anti (*exo*) are on opposite sides of the molecule and are far apart.\n    *   **Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between H_a and H_anti would be absent or very weak for the minor (exo) product.**\n\nThis analysis perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Finding to the Options**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects:\n*   The anhydride protons (H_a): **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The anti-bridge proton (H_anti): **a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A) Me(bridgehead) and Me(alkene) are close in both isomers.\n*   B) Me(bridgehead) and H_anti are close in both isomers.\n*   D) Me(alkene) and H_a are far apart in the major (*endo*) isomer but close in the minor (*exo*) isomer. This is the opposite of the observation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, giving one signal at ~7 ppm. The two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) give two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic ring system.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Products (Major and Minor):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the reaction, making it the kinetically favored product. The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures using the standard numbering for a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system:\n        *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7-methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the two methine protons (H5, H6) from the maleic anhydride part point *towards* the C2=C3 double bond, which bears the four methyl groups.\n        *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7-methylene bridge. Here, the H5 and H6 protons point *away* from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on the structures determined above:\n        *   In the **endo (major) product**, the H5/H6 protons are close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, a NOE cross-peak between them is expected.\n        *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the H5/H6 protons are far from these methyl groups. A NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation. The key cross-peak connects the H5/H6 protons with the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options:**\n    *   **H5/H6 Protons:** These two methine protons are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. They are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** is very reasonable. The option describes this as a \"2H singlet\".\n    *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are expected to appear as two distinct sets. Each set contains two methyl groups, leading to two signals, each with an integral of **6H**. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** is appropriate for methyl groups on a double bond in such a system. The option refers to \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\".\n    *   **Bridge Protons (C7-H₂):** These two protons are diastereotopic and would likely appear as two distinct signals, probably doublets. The option \"a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" likely corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n    *   **Other Methyl Protons:** The other set of vinyl methyls is given as \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm\".\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product connects the H5/H6 methine protons with one of the sets of vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Matching this with the provided options:\n        *   **\"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\"** corresponds to one set of vinyl methyl groups.\n        *   **\"A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"** corresponds to the H5/H6 methine protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: First, we need to determine the structures of the two starting materials.\n    *   **Dienophile**: The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This high degree of symmetry points to maleic acid, which dehydrates to form **maleic anhydride**. The NMR data is consistent: the two equivalent alkene protons give a single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons give two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene**: The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**: The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked under the newly formed ring, is usually the kinetically favored and thus the **major product**. The *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Product Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**: The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the spatial relationships between protons in the two products, which is what a 2D NOESY experiment reveals. A cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum indicates that two sets of protons are physically close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   **Proton Assignments**: Both products have a plane of symmetry. We can identify four main types of protons:\n        1.  **Me_vinyl**: The two methyl groups on the double bond (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm).\n        2.  **Me_bridgehead**: The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm).\n        3.  **H_anhydride**: The two protons on the five-membered anhydride ring (2H singlet, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls to ~3.5 ppm).\n        4.  **H_bridge**: The two protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor)**: In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side of the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_vinyl** protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, they are close to the **Me_bridgehead** protons.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one.

The ability to form a cyclic anhydride implies the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the molecule. A cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid like maleic acid fits this description perfectly.\n*   The anhydride's NMR data is provided:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n*   This data points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (one ¹³C signal) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (a second ¹³C signal).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n\n*   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups attached to the sp² hybridized carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the **endo** product and the **exo** product.\n    *   In the **endo** product, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the diene's original π-system (which becomes the double bond in the product). The endo product is usually the kinetically favored, **major product**.\n    *   In the **exo** product, the anhydride ring points away from the double bond. The exo product is usually the thermodynamically favored, **minor product**.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the endo and exo isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structures and Proton Environments**\n\n*   Let's analyze the protons in the product structure (a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative):\n    1.  **Alkene Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are attached to the C=C double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. They will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** Two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons (saturated sp³ carbons). They are also equivalent due to symmetry and will appear as a 6H singlet. Their chemical shift is typically lower, around 1.0-1.2 ppm.\n    3.  **Anhydride Protons:** These are the two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride. They are attached to carbons that are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a 2H singlet (coupling to the bridgehead protons is often negligible due to a ~90° dihedral angle). Their chemical shift will be relatively high due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyls, around 3.5 ppm.\n    4.  **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7) are generally not equivalent and would couple to each other, often appearing as a complex multiplet or two doublets. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially-proximate protons.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial interaction that exists in the endo isomer but not in the exo isomer.\n*   Let's compare the spatial arrangement in the two isomers:\n    *   **Endo (Major) Isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the C=C double bond. This brings the **anhydride protons** very close to the **alkene methyl protons**.\n    *   **Exo (Minor) Isomer:** The anhydride ring points *away* from the C=C double bond. The anhydride protons are far from the alkene methyl protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl protons**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Interacting Protons to the NMR Signals**\n\n*   Based on our chemical shift analysis in Step 4:\n    *   The **alkene methyl protons** correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The **anhydride protons** correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects these two signals.\n\n**Step 7: Select the Correct Answer**\n\n*   We are looking for the option that connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm with a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n*   Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). Incorrect.\n*   Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). **This is the correct answer.**\n*   Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This interaction would be stronger in the exo (minor) product. Incorrect.\n*   Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (alkene methyls). These groups are not close enough for a strong NOE. Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid forms a cyclic anhydride.\n        *   The ¹H NMR shows a single peak, meaning all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks, meaning there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H shift ~7 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons: two alkene carbons (¹³C shift ~137 ppm) and two carbonyl carbons (¹³C shift ~165 ppm).\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring with O, C=O, C(H)=C(H), C=O.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The reaction of a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) results in a bicyclic product with a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** core.\n    *   The product's molecular formula is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). The formula is correct.\n    *   The product structure is **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n        *   The **endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, formed through a transition state with favorable secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n        *   **Major Product = Endo isomer.**\n        *   **Minor Product = Exo isomer.**\n\n3.  **Analyze the 3D Structures of the Endo and Exo Isomers**\n    *   In the bicyclo[2.2.1] system, substituents on the C5/C6 bridge can be *endo* (pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond) or *exo* (pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond, towards the C7 bridge).\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring itself is in the *endo* position (tucked under the C2=C3 double bond). This means the two protons on C5 and C6 (originating from maleic anhydride) are in the *exo* position. In this orientation, they point towards the C7 bridge. The C7 bridge has two protons, one *syn* to the double bond and one *anti*. The *exo* protons at C5/C6 are spatially close to the *anti* proton on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This means the protons on C5 and C6 are in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, they are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states there is a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum that is absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis, the close proximity between the **protons at C5/C6** and the ***anti* proton at C7** is a unique feature of the major (*endo*) isomer. This interaction is absent in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak must connect the signals for these specific protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the molecule:\n        *   **Protons at C5/C6 (from anhydride):** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. Their chemical shift will be significantly downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n        *   **Protons at C7 (bridge):** These are two diastereotopic protons on a methylene bridge. They would typically appear as two separate signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. A chemical shift around 1-2 ppm is expected. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups. The vinylic methyls (at C2/C3) are deshielded relative to the bridgehead methyls (at C1/C4).\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two vinylic methyl groups.\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to the two bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The unique NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the protons at C5/C6 with one of the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction between the resonance at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and the resonance at **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). These are far apart in the endo isomer.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). An NOE might exist, but it would likely be present in both isomers, not a distinguishing feature.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This corresponds to the unique spatial proximity in the major (endo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride is maleic acid. The resulting anhydride is maleic anhydride. The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products (Stereoisomers):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetic control), due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is generally more stable (thermodynamic product) because it is less sterically hindered, but it forms more slowly.\n    *   Since the problem states a major and a minor product are formed, we can identify the major product as the *endo* isomer and the minor product as the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the *Endo* and *Exo* Products:**\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   There are four methyl groups: two on the bridgehead carbons (let's call them **Me-bridgehead**) and two on the double bond of the new six-membered ring (let's call them **Me-alkene**).\n    *   There are two equivalent protons where the anhydride ring is fused to the bicyclic system (let's call them **H-anhydride**).\n    *   **In the *endo* isomer (major product):** The anhydride ring is tucked under the diene system, on the same side as the newly formed double bond. This places the **H-anhydride** protons in close spatial proximity to the **Me-alkene** groups.\n    *   **In the *exo* isomer (minor product):** The anhydride ring points away from the diene system. This places the **H-anhydride** protons far from the **Me-alkene** groups but close to the **Me-bridgehead** groups.\n\n4.  **Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n    *   This specific cross-peak must correspond to an interaction unique to the *endo* (major) isomer. Based on our structural analysis, this is the interaction between the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H-anhydride:** These are two equivalent methine protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. They will be deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** (as a singlet due to symmetry) is a reasonable assignment.\n    *   **Me-alkene:** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls). They are deshielded compared to standard alkyl methyls. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is a good estimate.\n    *   **Me-bridgehead:** These are two equivalent methyl groups on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a more shielded environment. A chemical shift of **~1.0 ppm** and an integral of **6H** (as a singlet) is expected.\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis to the Options:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the **H-anhydride** protons and the **Me-alkene** protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect integration and multiplicity for the methyl signal.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal for the anhydride protons.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This correctly identifies the alkene methyls and the anhydride protons, which are close in space in the major (*endo*) product.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances of the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride bridgehead protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The 7 ppm shift is characteristic of vinylic (alkene) protons.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest a molecule with two types of carbon atoms. The 165 ppm peak is typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and the 137 ppm peak is in the range for an alkene carbon.\n        *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃), fits this data perfectly. It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O and two C=C), which explains the observed spectra.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This molecule has a five-membered ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. Typically, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored major product, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically more stable minor product. The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, consistent with the formation of both isomers.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Adducts and Proton Assignments:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n    *   **Protons and Signals:**\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These are on saturated carbons and will appear as a 6H singlet at a lower chemical shift, estimated around **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_alkene:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). These vinylic methyls will appear as a 6H singlet at a higher chemical shift, estimated around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **H_A:** Two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (C5, C6). These protons are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be a 2H singlet, shifted downfield to around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **C7 Protons:** The CH₂ bridge has two diastereotopic protons (*syn* and *anti* to the double bond). They will appear as two separate 1H signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. Their shift is estimated to be around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **NOESY Analysis to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The key to distinguishing the *endo* and *exo* isomers is identifying which protons are brought close together in each configuration.\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are far from the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C7 bridge and is on the same side as the double bond. In this orientation, the anhydride protons (H_A) are very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n    *   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product.\n        *   The NOE interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene) is strong and characteristic for the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n        *   Therefore, the absence of this peak is characteristic of the *endo* (major) isomer.\n        *   The question asks for a cross-peak that *is present* in the major product. Let's re-examine the options based on our signal assignments.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **Signal Assignments:**\n        *   6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm → Me_alkene\n        *   2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm → H_A (anhydride protons)\n        *   6H singlet at ~1 ppm → Me_bridgehead\n        *   1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm → C7 bridge proton\n    *   **Option A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene):** The distance between these two sets of methyl groups is significant in both isomers. A strong, differentiating NOE is not expected.\n    *   **Option B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** This corresponds to the interaction between the alkene methyl groups and the anhydride protons. As established, this interaction is characteristic of the *exo* (minor) product. Since the question asks for a cross-peak in the *major* product's spectrum which is absent in the minor, this is the inverse of what is described. However, it is the most significant stereochemical differentiating peak. There might be a misunderstanding in the problem's premise or the common kinetic/thermodynamic product distribution for this specific highly substituted system. Let's reconsider. The *endo* product is the kinetic product due to secondary orbital overlap. The *exo* is the thermodynamic product because it's less sterically hindered. The reaction is likely run under kinetic control, making the *endo* product major. But what if the steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene is so significant that it reverses the usual selectivity, making the *exo* product the major one? If the *exo* product were the major product, then the cross-peak between Me_alkene (~1.7 ppm) and H_A (~3.5 ppm) would be the correct answer. Given the options, this is the most plausible chemical scenario that leads to one of the answers.\n    *   **Option C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_A):** An interaction between H_A and a C7 proton exists in both isomers (with H_anti in *endo* and H_syn in *exo*). It is unlikely to be strongly present in one and completely absent in the other.\n    *   **Option D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 proton):** The distance between the bridgehead methyls and the C7 protons should be similar in both isomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most significant and differentiating NOE interaction is between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene). This interaction is strong in the *exo* isomer and very weak or absent in the *endo* isomer. The question describes a peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor. If we assume the major product is the *exo* isomer (which is plausible due to the steric bulk of the four methyl groups on the diene overriding the usual *endo* preference), then the cross-peak would be between the 6H singlet of the alkene methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This matches option B.\n\nFinal check: The interaction described in B is the most chemically sound for differentiating the two stereoisomers via NOESY. The ambiguity lies in which isomer is major. In many simple cases, *endo* is major. However, with heavily substituted dienes, this can be reversed. Assuming the question and options lead to a correct chemical conclusion, the most logical answer is that the major product is *exo*, and the observed cross-peak is between the spatially proximate alkene methyls and anhydride protons.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe analysis of the chemical problem proceeds in several steps:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts are appropriate for vinylic protons (~7 ppm), alkene carbons (~137 ppm), and carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic [4+2] cycloaddition known as the Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the substituted cyclopentadiene acts as the diene.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Products:** The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one, both with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. In Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes, two stereoisomeric products can form: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore major product, formed due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is generally the thermodynamically more stable, but minor, product. Thus, the major product is the *endo* isomer and the minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing Products with NOESY NMR:** A 2D NOESY experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space correlation), which is ideal for distinguishing between *endo* and *exo* isomers. A cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor one points to a unique spatial relationship in the *endo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Structural and Spectral Analysis:**\n    *   **Symmetry and Proton Signals:** The resulting bicyclic product has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two methyl groups on the double bond equivalent (a 6H singlet), the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons equivalent (another 6H singlet), and the two protons on the anhydride portion of the ring equivalent (a 2H singlet).\n    *   **Chemical Shift Assignments:**\n        *   The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them H_succinyl) are alpha to carbonyl groups and are typically found around 3.5 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene) are vinylic methyls and are expected to be more deshielded than saturated methyls. They correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   The methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead) would be further upfield, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   The remaining signal, a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, belongs to one of the protons on the methylene bridge.\n    *   ***Endo* vs. *Exo* Geometry:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the newly formed six-membered ring. This geometry brings the H_succinyl protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the H_succinyl protons are far from the Me_alkene groups but are close to the methylene bridge protons and the bridgehead methyl groups.\n    *   **The Decisive Cross-Peak:** The NOESY cross-peak observed in the major product but not the minor product must be due to the interaction that is unique to the *endo* geometry. This is the close proximity between the H_succinyl protons and the Me_alkene protons. Therefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and the resonance at ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl).\n    *   The high symmetry (single ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and the chemical shifts are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H singlet ~7.0-7.3 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons (alkene carbons ~137 ppm and carbonyl carbons ~165 ppm). This perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C=C-C=C).\n    *   The four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) each have a methyl group.\n    *   The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The product's molecular formula should be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given for the products, confirming our reactant identification.\n\n**3. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction with a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene can produce two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct.\n*   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction under kinetic control is the *endo* adduct. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the dienophile's activating groups (the anhydride part) and the developing double bond in the transition state. The *exo* adduct is typically the minor product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures: The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the newly formed double bond (C(Me)=C(Me)) and on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. This means the anhydride protons are *syn* (on the same face) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the CH₂ bridge and on the opposite side of the double bond. This means the anhydride protons are *anti* (on opposite faces) to the alkene's methyl groups.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's analyze the key proximities:\n    *   **Interaction 1: Anhydride Protons vs. Alkene Methyl Groups.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the alkene methyl groups. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the alkene methyl groups. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n    *   **Interaction 2: Anhydride Protons vs. CH₂ Bridge Protons.**\n        *   In the **endo** (major) product, the anhydride protons are *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. They are far apart. **No NOE** is expected.\n        *   In the **exo** (minor) product, the anhydride protons are *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. They are close in space. A **strong NOE** is expected.\n\n*   Since the distinguishing cross-peak is present in the major product (endo), it must be due to the interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **alkene methyl groups**.\n\n**5. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\n*   Now we need to match these proton groups to the signals described in the options.\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two of them. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to bridgehead carbons with no protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**. Their chemical shift, being on a strained ring and alpha to two carbonyl groups, will be relatively high, around 3-4 ppm. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Alkene Methyl Groups:** There are two methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. This will give a **singlet** with an integral of **6H**. The chemical shift for methyl groups on a double bond is typically around 1.5-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups on sp³ carbons. This would be a 6H singlet at a lower shift, ~1.0 ppm.\n*   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons, likely giving a complex signal (or two doublets) integrating to 2H in the aliphatic region.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl groups.\n*   These correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   This matches option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   A) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n*   B) 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm, one bridge H) and 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm, anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product.\n*   C) 6H singlet (~1 ppm, bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm, alkene Me). This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly identifies the unique NOE cross-peak in the major product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C).\n    *   The single ¹H peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. The shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons in an electron-deficient environment.\n    *   The two ¹³C peaks indicate two types of carbons, consistent with equivalent alkene carbons and equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, leading to the observed simple NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. It has four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n    *   The molecular formula of the diene is C₉H₁₂.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring.\n*   The product is a bicyclic adduct. The cyclopentadiene ring becomes a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is usually the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically controlled). This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is usually the minor product.\n*   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to the formation of the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Products**\n\n*   Let's draw the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) adducts.\n    *   The resulting bicyclic system is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.\n    *   There are methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C5 and C6.\n    *   There are two protons at C5 and C6, which came from the maleic anhydride.\n    *   There is a CH₂ bridge at C7.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₂) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃).\n    *   The problem states the molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This suggests a subsequent reaction, likely hydrogenation of a double bond, has occurred. However, the chemical shifts provided in the options (especially 1.7 ppm for a methyl group) are characteristic of the un-hydrogenated product (C₁₃H₁₄O₃), where the methyl group is attached to a double bond (vinylic methyl). A methyl group in the hydrogenated product would appear at a much higher field (~1.0-1.2 ppm). This strong contradiction suggests the molecular formula given in the problem is a typo, and we should proceed by analyzing the structure of the direct Diels-Alder adduct, C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's examine the key distances in both isomers:\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. They are spatially close to the methyl groups on this double bond (at C2, C3). They are far from the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) adduct:** The anhydride protons (at C5, C6) are on the opposite side of the C2=C3 double bond. They are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n*   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be between the **anhydride protons (H₅, H₆)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n\n*   Let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the groups involved in this key NOE in the major (*endo*) product. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride protons (H₅, H₆):** These two protons are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and bridgehead carbons. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a downfield shift, estimated around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Me₂, Me₃):** These two methyl groups are attached to the double bond and are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. The typical shift for vinylic methyls is around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The NOESY cross-peak should connect these two signals. We are looking for an option that describes a correlation between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridge proton (H₇) and the anhydride protons (H₅, H₆), characteristic of the *minor* (exo) product.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This would be an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. This interaction is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique feature distinguishing them.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This perfectly matches our prediction for the key NOE in the major (*endo*) product between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This would be an NOE between a bridgehead methyl group and a bridge proton.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product arises from the unique spatial proximity of the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups in the *endo* isomer. This corresponds to a NOE between a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride (Dienophile):** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7.0 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). A single peak implies that the vinylic protons are chemically equivalent, which points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks: one at 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O) and one at 137 ppm (characteristic of a vinylic carbon, C=C). The presence of only two signals for a molecule with at least four carbons confirms a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest and most common structure that fits all these criteria is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent (giving one ¹H signal) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as the two vinylic carbons equivalent (giving two ¹³C signals).\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring fused to the existing five-membered ring, creating a bicyclic system.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of the diene (C₉H₁₄) and the dienophile (C₄H₂O₃).\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** **adduct** and the ***exo*** **adduct**.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product, meaning it forms faster and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is a 2D NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å apart), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **Visualizing the Adducts:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the C=C double bond. This places the two protons on the anhydride portion of the backbone (let's call them **H_anhydride**) in a position where they point towards the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is positioned \"away\" from the C=C double bond. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in a position where they point towards the vinylic methyl groups on the C=C double bond and are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   **Identifying the Key NOE Interaction:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the **H_anhydride** protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak that is unique to the major product is the one between the **H_anhydride** protons and the protons on the **C7 bridge**.\n\n**4. Assign NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n\nNow we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in our structure.\n\n*   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. They will be significantly deshielded. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is appropriate. Due to a plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** The C7 bridge has two protons that are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled to each other, so they will appear as doublets. Being aliphatic protons in a strained ring, a chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is reasonable for one of them. This corresponds to a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the double bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are equivalent. They are more shielded and will appear as a **6H singlet** at **~1.0 ppm**.\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are not uniquely close in the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride). This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7 bridge proton). This is not the key differentiating feature between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n        *   The single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent protons in the alkene region.\n        *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks correspond to two types of carbons. The peak at 137 ppm is in the range for alkene carbons (C=C), and the peak at 165 ppm is in the range for anhydride carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n        *   The high symmetry (one type of proton, two types of carbon) and the spectral data perfectly match the structure of **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem states this is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4) and a CH₂ group at C5. Each of the four carbons in the diene system has a methyl group attached.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are formed: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* products. The *endo* product is usually the major product due to favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state (kinetic control).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   In the Diels-Alder reaction, the C1 and C4 of the diene react with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond. A new six-membered ring is formed, and the CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes a one-carbon bridge (C7) in a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   The resulting product is **1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n        *   **Methyl groups:** Two are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and two are on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   **Anhydride ring:** Fused at positions C2 and C3.\n        *   **Protons:** The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now at positions C2 and C3. The CH₂ bridge is at C7.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between the *Endo* (Major) and *Exo* (Minor) Isomers:**\n    *   The key difference is the stereochemistry of the fused anhydride ring relative to the C5=C6 double bond within the bicyclic system.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C5=C6 double bond. It is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C5=C6 double bond. It is on the same side (*syn*) of the C7 bridge.\n\n5.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum and Assign ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   NOESY shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (at C2 and C3). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the C5=C6 double bond. Methyl groups on a double bond typically resonate in this region. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). Saturated alkyl methyl groups resonate here. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is likely one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n6.  **Identify the Key NOE Correlation:**\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships in the two isomers:\n        *   **In the *endo* (major) product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* to the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C2, C3) into close proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (at C5, C6). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   **In the *exo* (minor) product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* to the C5=C6 double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **Me_alkene** groups. The NOE between them would be absent or very weak. Instead, the H_anhydride protons are now close to the C7 bridge protons.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOE cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be the one between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n    *   This corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n    *   Looking at the options, this matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants**\n\n*   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C spectrum. This spectroscopic data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. The Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically favored product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n**3. Structure and NMR of the Products**\n\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. The reaction of the symmetric diene and symmetric dienophile results in a product with a plane of symmetry.\n*   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride).\n*   Based on the structure, we can predict the ¹H NMR signals:\n    *   **Two equivalent vinylic methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, typically around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups:** A singlet for 6 protons, in a more shielded environment, around 1.0 ppm.\n    *   **Two equivalent protons from the anhydride part:** A singlet for 2 protons, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups, around 3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Two methylene bridge protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (one is *syn* or \"up\" and the other is *anti* or \"down\" relative to the double bond). They are not chemically equivalent and will couple to each other, appearing as two separate doublets. Their chemical shifts are typically around 1.3-1.5 ppm.\n*   This predicted spectrum (two 6H singlets, one 2H singlet, and two 1H doublets) is consistent with the signals described in the options.\n\n**4. Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **In the *endo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicycloheptene system. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n*   **In the *exo* isomer:** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n*   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is a definitive characteristic of the *endo* adduct and will be absent in the *exo* adduct.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   The major product is the *endo* adduct.\n*   The distinguishing cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* geometry.\n*   This corresponds to the interaction between the **anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two equivalent alkene protons give the single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons (137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (165 ppm) give the two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   When a cyclic diene and a cyclic dienophile react, a bicyclic product is formed. This reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry and Structure of Products:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond in the six-membered ring.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) to the double bond.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is an NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected through chemical bonds.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. This indicates a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Structural Analysis and Proton Assignment:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the major (*endo*) product to identify protons that are close in space.\n        *   **Protons from Maleic Anhydride:** These two protons are attached to the carbons that were part of the dienophile's double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift will be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of methyl groups.\n            *   **Vinyl Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the carbons of the double bond. They are equivalent due to symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically in the vinylic methyl region, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n            *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent and will appear as another **6H singlet**. Being on saturated carbons, they will be further upfield, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the two anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are held underneath the C=C double bond, bringing them very close to the two vinyl methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm). This proximity will generate a strong NOESY cross-peak.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are pointing away from the C=C double bond. They are distant from the vinyl methyl groups, so no significant NOESY cross-peak would be observed between them.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The differentiating cross-peak, present in the major product and absent in the minor, connects the anhydride protons with the vinyl methyl protons. Based on the chemical shift and integration assignments:\n    *   The anhydride protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinyl methyl protons are the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe search results confirm the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Diels-Alder Reaction and Stereochemistry**: The reaction between a cyclic diene (like a cyclopentadiene derivative) and maleic anhydride produces a bicyclic adduct. The major product is typically the *endo* isomer due to kinetic control, which involves favorable secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* isomer is the thermodynamically more stable, but minor, product.\n\n2.  **Product Structures**:\n    *   **Diene**: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This has a C5 ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n    *   **Dienophile**: Maleic anhydride.\n    *   **Adduct**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. The bridge is the CH₂ group (C7 in bicyclic nomenclature). The double bond is between the carbons that were C2 and C3 of the diene. The anhydride ring is fused to the other two carbons.\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the CH₂ bridge.\n\n3.  **NMR Spectroscopy and NOESY**:\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n    *   The key difference between the *endo* and *exo* isomers is the spatial relationship between the anhydride protons and the bridge (CH₂) protons.\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons are close to the *syn*-proton of the CH₂ bridge. This will result in a NOESY cross-peak.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the CH₂ bridge protons. This NOE interaction will be absent or very weak.\n\n4.  **Signal Assignment from the Question**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This chemical shift is characteristic of the protons on the anhydride ring, which are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This signal corresponds to one of the protons of the CH₂ bridge. The bridge protons are diastereotopic and would couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as doublets.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: Likely the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: Likely the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The question states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product. This uniquely identifying cross-peak must be the one connecting the protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the bridge protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the signal for the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the signal for one of the bridge protons (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The ¹H NMR signal at 7 ppm is in the alkene region. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   The ¹³C NMR signals at ~165 ppm and ~137 ppm are characteristic of anhydride carbonyl carbons and alkene carbons, respectively. Having only two peaks also indicates a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (giving one ¹H signal) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O carbons and two C=C carbons), giving two ¹³C signals. The starting acid was maleic acid. The formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. (C₅ ring + 4xCH₃ groups - 4xH atoms = C₉; 6H on parent cyclopentadiene ring - 4H + 4x3H = C₉H₁₄).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. According to the \"endo rule,\" the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored product, making it the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and NOESY Data**\n    *   The key to solving the problem is to understand the spatial arrangement of atoms in the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products and how this affects the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE), which gives rise to cross-peaks in a NOESY spectrum. NOEs are observed between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   We need to find a pair of proton groups that are close in the major product but far apart in the minor product.\n\n    Let's analyze the structures of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene adducts formed:\n    *   **Proton Groups:**\n        *   **H_anhydride:** The two equivalent protons on the carbons derived from maleic anhydride. They will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be around 3-4 ppm due to the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's assign this to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_vinyl:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (from C2 and C3 of the diene). They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their shift will be in the vinyl methyl region, ~1.6-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (from C1 and C4 of the diene). They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their shift will be around 1.0-1.5 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **H_bridge:** The two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge (CH₂ group). They will form a complex multiplet, likely appearing as two separate signals.\n\n    *   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n        *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *endo* (i.e., *syn* or cis to the C7 bridge). This places the **H_anhydride** protons in the *exo* position (i.e., *anti* or trans to the C7 bridge). In a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, *exo* substituents on the C5/C6 positions are on the same face as the C=C double bond. Therefore, in the major product, **H_anhydride protons are close to the Me_vinyl groups**. A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *exo*. This places the **H_anhydride** protons in the *endo* position. *Endo* substituents on C5/C6 are on the opposite face of the C=C double bond. Therefore, in the minor product, **H_anhydride protons are far from the Me_vinyl groups**. The NOESY cross-peak will be absent or very weak.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product. Our analysis shows that this specific observation corresponds to the interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n    *   The resonance for **Me_vinyl** is the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   The resonance for **H_anhydride** is the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n    Therefore, the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This corresponds to option A.\n\nLet's briefly dismiss the other options:\n*   B) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm): These groups are on adjacent carbons in both isomers. The NOE should be present in both major and minor products.\n*   C) A bridge proton (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm): This interaction is strong in the minor (*exo*) adduct (where H_anhydride is *endo*) and weak in the major (*endo*) adduct (where H_anhydride is *exo*). This is the opposite of the observation.\n*   D) Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) and a bridge proton (~1.5 ppm): These groups are close in both isomers, so the NOE should be present in both.\n\nThe correct answer identifies the interaction that uniquely characterizes the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a detailed analysis to determine which resonances are connected by the key cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n\n1.  **The Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent vinylic protons give the singlet at 7 ppm, while the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) account for the ¹³C signals. The molecular formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n2.  **The Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n3.  **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄), confirming it is an addition reaction.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Two stereoisomers, an *endo* and an *exo* product, are formed.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable product. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Endo* Isomer**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Exo* Isomer**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Spatial Relationships for NOESY\n\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) arises between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak in a 2D NOESY spectrum connects the signals of two such protons. The question states that a cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's visualize the two isomers:\n\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride part of the molecule is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 (CH₂) bridge. In this arrangement, the protons on the anhydride ring carbons (let's call them **H_anhydride**) are positioned underneath the bicyclic system, pointing toward the C2=C3 double bond. This brings them very close to the methyl groups attached to this double bond (the **vinylic methyl groups**).\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride part is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons point toward the C7 bridge and away from the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the key NOE that distinguishes the major (*endo*) product is the spatial interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **vinylic methyl** protons.\n\n### Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals\n\nNow, let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for the product and match them to the options provided. The product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) has four main sets of protons:\n\n1.  **Vinylic Methyl Protons (6H):** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. These typically resonate around 1.6–2.2 ppm. Option D's \"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\" is a perfect match.\n2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (6H):** Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. These are more shielded and appear further upfield, typically around 1.0-1.3 ppm.\n3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_anhydride, 2H):** Two equivalent protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused. These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. A chemical shift in the range of 3-4 ppm is expected. Option D's \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\" is an excellent fit.\n4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons (2H):** The two protons of the C7 bridge.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Cross-Peak\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The distinguishing NOE in the major (*endo*) product is between the **vinylic methyl protons** and the **anhydride protons (H_anhydride)**.\n*   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me)\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)**\n\nThe correct answer is D, as it identifies the two groups of protons (vinylic methyls and anhydride methines) that are uniquely close in the major *endo* adduct, and correctly assigns their expected integrals and chemical shifts.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nThis problem describes a classic organic chemistry reaction and its analysis using NMR spectroscopy. Let's break it down step-by-step to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent (one signal), and by symmetry, there are only two types of carbons: the two alkene carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O).\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly given as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n3.  **Identify the Products and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is typically the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored). The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   In the **endo product**, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system, placing it \"under\" the double bond derived from the diene.\n    *   In the **exo product**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in 3D space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not bonded.\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* adduct.\n    *   Let's visualize the *endo* product. The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond of the other ring. This brings the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused very close to the two methyl groups that are also on that same face (*syn* methyls).\n    *   In the *exo* product, the anhydride ring points away, so these protons are far from the methyl groups. Therefore, the NOE interaction between the anhydride protons and the *syn* methyls is the key difference.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals:**\n    *   Let's look at the protons in the product and the signals provided in the options.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the carbons where the anhydride is fused. They are bridgehead protons and are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly, shifting them downfield to ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Two 6H singlets (~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm):** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. Due to the geometry of the bicyclic system, they are not equivalent. The two methyl groups on the same side as the anhydride ring (*syn* methyls) are in a different chemical environment than the two on the opposite side (*anti* methyls).\n        *   The *syn* methyls are spatially close to the electron-withdrawing anhydride ring. This proximity causes them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). Thus, they correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   The *anti* methyls are further away and are more shielded, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal likely corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the single-carbon bridge of the bicyclic system.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major (*endo*) product is between the protons that are only close in that isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride-fused protons (~3.5 ppm) and the *syn*-methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** and the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.

The anhydride has highly symmetrical NMR spectra:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent alkene protons, deshielded by neighboring electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n    *   This set of data uniquely identifies the starting material as *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid) and the resulting anhydride as **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's determine its structure. 1,3-cyclopentadiene has double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4. Methyl groups are placed at all four of these positions. The remaining C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n               C(5)H₂\n              /   \\\n        (Me)C(4)---C(1)(Me)\n             ||      ||\n        (Me)C(3)---C(2)(Me)\n        ```\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula. The diene has 9 carbon atoms (5 in the ring, 4 in methyl groups) and 14 hydrogen atoms (2 on C5, 12 in the four methyl groups). The formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction and Product Structure**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**.\n*   The reaction yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) adds across the C1 and C4 positions of the diene.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is typically the major product due to kinetic control (secondary orbital overlap), while the *exo* is the minor product.\n\n    *   **Major Product (Endo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (\"syn\") as the C2=C3 double bond bridge.\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo Adduct):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (\"anti\") to the C2=C3 double bond bridge.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Spatial Proximity for NOESY Spectroscopy**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n*   The question asks for a cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* geometry but far apart in the *exo* geometry.\n\n*   Let's analyze the structures:\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them H_anhydride) are tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system. In this position, they are spatially close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The H_anhydride protons are pointing \"away\" from the bicyclic system. In this position, they are far from the Me_vinyl groups. They are, however, closer to the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead).\n\n*   Therefore, the key differentiating NOESY cross-peak is between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**. This interaction will be strong in the major (endo) product and absent in the minor (exo) product.\n\n**Step 4: Predict ¹H NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n\n*   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry. This leads to signal equivalence:\n    *   The two H_anhydride protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3.5 ppm) as they are alpha to carbonyls.\n    *   The two Me_vinyl groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. The chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is typically around ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   The two Me_bridgehead groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. They will be more shielded, with a shift around ~1.0 ppm.\n    *   The two protons on the C7 bridge are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n\n*   We are looking for the NOESY cross-peak between H_anhydride (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and Me_vinyl (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n*   Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: This is an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups (Me_bridgehead and Me_vinyl). They are not uniquely close in the endo product.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: The signal description (1H doublet) does not match our analysis of the highly symmetric product.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This perfectly matches our predicted interaction between Me_vinyl (6H, ~1.7 ppm) and H_anhydride (2H, ~3.5 ppm).\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: The signal description (1H doublet) is inconsistent with the product's symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl) and the anhydride protons (H_anhydride). This corresponds to an interaction between a 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm), as described in option C. The \"1H doublet\" in options B and D appears to be inconsistent with the symmetry of the molecule and is likely a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at ~7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm, indicating two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   These data perfectly match **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent (appearing as a singlet, ~7.2 ppm in reality) and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (~165 ppm), and the two vinyl carbons equivalent (~137 ppm).\n        *   Reactant 1: Maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1,3 and methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product would be C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* adduct, as it is formed faster (kinetically favored) due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* adduct is usually the minor product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structures of the *Endo* and *Exo* Products:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures. We can draw a side view of the bicyclic system. The key is the relative orientation of the anhydride ring with respect to the rest of the molecule, particularly the C7-CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. Consequently, the two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_A) are also on this side, pointing towards the C7-CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-CH₂ bridge. The two H_A protons are pointing away from the C7-CH₂ bridge and towards the C=C double bond of the structure.\n\n    Here are simplified representations showing the key protons:\n\n    *   **Endo (Major Product):**\n        ```\n              (C7-CH2 Bridge)\n                  /   \\\n        ...---H_A ... H_A---...\n        Protons H_A are CLOSE to the C7-CH2 bridge protons.\n        ```\n    *   **Exo (Minor Product):**\n        ```\n        ...---H_A ... H_A---...\n                  \\   /\n              (C7-CH2 Bridge)\n        Protons H_A are FAR from the C7-CH2 bridge protons.\n        (They are close to the alkene methyl groups instead).\n        ```\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This cross-peak must arise from a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis in step 3, the pair of protons that fits this description is **H_A** (the anhydride protons) and the **C7-CH₂ bridge protons**.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals from the Options:**\n    *   The product molecule is symmetrical, leading to fewer signals than protons.\n        *   The two H_A protons are equivalent: **2H singlet**.\n        *   The two methyl groups on the alkene are equivalent: **6H singlet**.\n        *   The two methyl groups on the bridgeheads are equivalent: **6H singlet**.\n        *   The two protons on the C7-CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic and couple to each other: **two 1H signals, likely doublets**.\n    *   Let's match these to the signals described in the options:\n        *   **A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the anhydride protons, **H_A**. The chemical shift is reasonable for protons alpha to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring.\n        *   **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This corresponds to one of the **C7-CH₂ bridge protons**. Shielded protons on a C7 bridge in norbornene systems often appear in this region.\n        *   **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the vinylic methyl groups.\n        *   **A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** This corresponds to the more shielded bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The differentiating NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects protons that are uniquely close in that isomer.\n    *   This is the interaction between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the C7-CH₂ bridge protons.\n    *   Matching this to the assigned signals: The cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_A) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (a C7-CH₂ proton).\n    *   This corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n    Let's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n    *   B) Interaction between a bridgehead methyl and a bridge proton. This distance is similar in both isomers.\n    *   C) Interaction between an alkene methyl and an anhydride proton (H_A). This interaction would be strong in the *minor* (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n    *   D) Interaction between the two sets of methyl groups. This distance is fixed in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the anhydride protons and the C7-bridge protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high degree of symmetry, along with the chemical shifts, points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two vinyl protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is often favored due to secondary orbital interactions (kinetic control). However, the diene used here is heavily substituted with four methyl groups.\n    *   The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene create significant steric hindrance. This hindrance disfavors the *endo* transition state, where the anhydride ring would be tucked underneath and clash with these methyl groups.\n    *   Consequently, the *exo* transition state is less sterically hindered and leads to the **exo adduct as the major product**. The *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and Expected NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the major (*exo*) product but not in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the product:\n        *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons (Meₐ):** Two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the newly formed cyclohexene ring. They are equivalent by symmetry. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Meₑ):** Two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.0-1.2 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride-Junction Protons (Hₓ):** The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. They are equivalent by symmetry and not coupled to other protons. Signal: **2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm** (deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups).\n    *   Now, let's consider the spatial arrangement in each isomer:\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the CH₂ bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) are oriented inward, pointing directly toward the vinyl methyl groups (Meₐ). This proximity will result in a **strong NOESY cross-peak** between Hₓ and Meₐ.\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge. Here, the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) are oriented outward, far away from the vinyl methyl groups (Meₐ). Therefore, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak will be **absent or very weak**.\n\n5.  **Match the Findings with the Options:**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak, present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor (*endo*), connects the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) and the vinyl methyl protons (Meₐ).\n    *   The signals are: a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (Hₓ) and a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Meₐ).\n    *   This corresponds directly to option D.\n\n    *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Incorrect integration and multiplicity for the methyl group signal.\n    *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Incorrect signal for the anhydride-junction protons.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups. While possible, it is not the key distinguishing interaction between the two isomers.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches the expected NOE correlation between the vinyl methyl protons and the anhydride-junction protons in the major *exo* product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying the reactants, predicting the products of a Diels-Alder reaction, and then using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, specifically a 2D NOESY experiment, to determine the stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification**: A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The high symmetry of maleic anhydride results in the two alkene protons being chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **Reaction Identification**: Maleic anhydride (a dienophile) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (a diene). This is a classic Diels-Alder reaction, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition. The reaction is stereospecific and typically yields two diastereomeric products: a major *endo* product and a minor *exo* product. The formation of the *endo* product is kinetically favored due to secondary orbital overlap in the transition state.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Stereochemistry**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The major product is the *endo* adduct. In this context, *endo* refers to the stereoisomer where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the one-carbon bridge (the C7 methylene group). The minor, or *exo*, product has the anhydride ring on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **NMR Analysis (NOESY)**: A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. We must identify which protons are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n    *   **Proton Assignments**:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**: This is one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge, likely the one *syn* to the double bond. It appears as a doublet due to coupling with the other bridge proton.\n\n    *   **Spatial Relationships**:\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the C7 bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *anti* to the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. Instead, they are brought into proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (~1.7 ppm).\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to the resonances at ~3.5 ppm and ~1.5 ppm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is the one that connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants\n\n1.  **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride**: A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are on a double bond.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks: one at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and one at 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl carbon, C=O).\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (~7.2 ppm) and due to its C₂v symmetry, it has two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **Diene**: The diene is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups at positions C1, C2, C3, and C4. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n### Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride). This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the combination of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction typically yields two stereoisomeric products:\n*   The **major product** is the *endo* adduct, formed via a transition state with stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   The **minor product** is the *exo* adduct, which is often more sterically stable but kinetically disfavored.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Products and their NMR Signals\n\nThe product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton. Key proton groups are:\n*   **H_anhydride**: Two equivalent protons on C2 and C3, originating from maleic anhydride. They appear as a **2H singlet around 3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Me_alkene**: Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C5, C6). Vinylic methyl groups typically resonate as a **6H singlet around 1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Me_bridgehead**: Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). These alkyl methyls appear as a **6H singlet around 1.0 ppm**.\n*   **H_bridge**: Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They would give two separate 1H signals. The problem describes one of these as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n### Step 4: Differentiate Between *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers using NOESY\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates their spatial proximity. The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This allows us to identify the stereochemistry.\n\n*   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C5=C6 double bond. This geometry places the H_anhydride protons (on C2, C3) pointing away from the double bond and close to the C7 methylene bridge protons (specifically the *anti*-proton) and the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead).\n*   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the double bond. This places the H_anhydride protons pointing towards the double bond, making them close to the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene).\n\nThe crucial NOE cross-peak, which is present only in the major (*endo*) product, must correspond to a proximity unique to that isomer. The possibilities are:\n1.  **H_anhydride ↔ Me_bridgehead**: An interaction between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm.\n2.  **H_anhydride ↔ H_bridge**: An interaction between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and one of the 1H signals for the bridge protons, given as ~1.5 ppm.\n\nConversely, the NOE between **H_anhydride ↔ Me_alkene** (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) would be characteristic of the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's match the predicted NOEs with the given choices:\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between Me_bridgehead and Me_alkene. The distance between these groups is not expected to differ significantly between the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between one of the **H_bridge** protons and the **H_anhydride** protons. This proximity is a key feature of the **endo** isomer. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is an NOE between **Me_bridgehead** and an **H_bridge** proton. This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to an NOE between **Me_alkene** and **H_anhydride** protons. This proximity is characteristic of the ***exo*** **(minor)** product. Since the cross-peak is observed in the major product, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option describing an NOE interaction that is uniquely present (or significantly stronger) in the major *endo* product is the one between the anhydride protons and a bridge proton.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single 1H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two 13C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single 1H peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift at 7 ppm is in the vinylic/aromatic region.\n        *   Two 13C peaks indicate two types of carbon atoms. 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and 137 ppm is a vinylic carbon deshielded by electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   The only structure that fits these data is **maleic anhydride**. It is derived from maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). It has two equivalent vinylic protons and a plane of symmetry, resulting in two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition** between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the kinetic product (usually the major product unless the reaction is run under thermodynamic control) is the *endo* adduct. This is because of favorable secondary orbital overlap between the π-system of the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups (the carbonyls) and the developing π-bond in the diene (at C2-C3).\n    *   **Major Product = Endo adduct:** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond of the bicyclic system.\n    *   **Minor Product = Exo adduct:** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY shows through-space correlations between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\n4.  **Examine the Structures for Proton Proximity:**\n    *   Let's identify the different types of protons in the product molecule and estimate their chemical shifts:\n        *   **H_anhydride:** Protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (at positions C5 and C6). They are alpha to carbonyl groups. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. We expect a **2H singlet** at a downfield position, around **3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_vinyl:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (at C2 and C3). They are equivalent by symmetry. We expect a **6H singlet** for these vinylic methyls, around **1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead:** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). They are also equivalent. We expect a **6H singlet** for these tertiary alkyl methyls, typically upfield, around **1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **CH₂_bridge:** The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and should give rise to two signals, likely a pair of doublets (an AB quartet), around **1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   **Proximity in the Major (Endo) Adduct:**\n        *   In the *endo* structure, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   This brings the **H_anhydride** protons (at C5, C6) very close in space to the **Me_vinyl** protons (at C2, C3). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are far from the CH₂_bridge protons (at C7) as they are on opposite faces of the bicyclic ring system.\n\n    *   **Proximity in the Minor (Exo) Adduct:**\n        *   In the *exo* structure, the anhydride ring points away from the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   The **H_anhydride** protons are now very far from the **Me_vinyl** protons. No significant NOE cross-peak is expected.\n        *   The H_anhydride protons are now on the same face as the C7 bridge, so an NOE between them would be possible.\n\n5.  **Match the Findings with the Options:**\n    *   The differentiating NOE—present in the major product and absent in the minor—is between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n    *   Based on our chemical shift assignments:\n        *   H_anhydride = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   Me_vinyl = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   The cross-peak connects the resonance of the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   This corresponds exactly to option A.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n*   B) Me_bridgehead (~1 ppm) and CH₂_bridge (~1.5 ppm): This distance should be similar in both isomers.\n*   C) Me_bridgehead (~1 ppm) and Me_vinyl (~1.7 ppm): This distance is fixed by the covalent framework and is identical in both isomers.\n*   D) CH₂_bridge (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm): This interaction would be strong in the *minor (exo)* product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with the principles of Diels-Alder stereochemistry and NOESY analysis is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C NMR. This spectroscopic data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinyl protons, giving a single ¹H NMR peak (δ ≈ 7.0 ppm).\n    *   Due to symmetry, it has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, resulting in two ¹³C NMR peaks. The chemical shifts are characteristic for these functional groups.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4).\n    *   There are methyl groups on each of the four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n    *   The fifth carbon of the ring (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   **The Stereochemistry (Endo/Exo Isomers):** Diels-Alder reactions often produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The formation of a major and minor product indicates that both are formed, with one being favored.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** states that the kinetically favored product (usually the major product, especially at lower temperatures) is the *endo* isomer. In this isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *anti* to the shortest bridge of the bicyclic system (the C5-CH₂ group). This orientation allows for favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state.\n    *   The **Exo** isomer is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored (minor) product. Here, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Structure of the Products:** The reaction yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Let's determine the substitution pattern based on the reactants:\n    *   The C1, C2, C3, and C4 atoms of the diene and the two alkene carbons of maleic anhydride form the new six-membered ring.\n    *   The C5-CH₂ group of the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system.\n    *   The C1 and C4 atoms of the diene become the bridgehead carbons. They each carry a methyl group.\n    *   A new double bond forms between C2 and C3 of the diene. These carbons each carry a methyl group.\n    *   The maleic anhydride part is fused to the C5 and C6 positions of the new bicyclic system. These carbons each have a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the sum of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ from the diene and C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride).\n\n**3. Analyze the NMR Spectra and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **Symmetry and ¹H NMR Prediction:** The product molecule (both endo and exo isomers) possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C7-CH₂ bridge and the anhydride oxygen. This simplifies the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, expected around **δ ≈ 1.0 ppm**.\n    2.  **Alkene Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3) are also equivalent. This gives another **6H singlet**. Being on a double bond, their shift will be further downfield, around **δ ≈ 1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Methine Protons:** The two protons on the carbons from the maleic anhydride (C5, C6) are equivalent. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups, so they will be significantly deshielded, around **δ ≈ 3.5 ppm**. Since their neighbors (the bridgehead carbons) have no protons, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    4.  **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the C7-CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic (one *syn* and one *anti* to the C2=C3 double bond) and will likely appear as a complex multiplet or two doublets of doublets, integrating to 2H total. One of these might appear as a doublet around **δ ≈ 1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **NOESY Analysis (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This must arise from a unique spatial relationship in the major (endo) isomer.\n\n    *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the methine protons (from the anhydride, δ ≈ 3.5 ppm) on the same face of the molecule as the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, these methine protons are spatially close to the alkene methyl groups (δ ≈ 1.7 ppm). **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between the methine protons and the alkene methyl protons.**\n\n    *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the methine protons far away from the alkene methyl groups. No NOE is expected between them. Instead, the methine protons are now close to the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The cross-peak that is present only in the major product connects the methine protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n**4. Match with the Options**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   The cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (methine protons) and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (alkene methyls).\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`). This interaction is not unique to the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_alkene`). This interaction is also not unique to the major product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_alkene`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_methine`). This matches our conclusion for the unique NOE in the major (endo) product.**\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_methine`). This interaction is characteristic of the minor (exo) product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying reactants from spectral data, predicting the products and stereochemistry of a Diels-Alder reaction, and interpreting 2D NOESY NMR spectra to distinguish between the stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride (Dienophile):** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data is key to its identification:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is in the alkene (vinylic) region. A single peak means all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates there are only two chemically unique carbon environments.\n    *   The only structure that fits this description (a cyclic anhydride from a *cis*-alkene) and the high symmetry indicated by the NMR data is **maleic anhydride**. It possesses a plane of symmetry that renders its two vinylic protons equivalent (one ¹H signal) and its two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons equivalent, respectively (two ¹³C signals).\n\n*   **The Diene:** This is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. When a cyclic diene and dienophile are used, two stereoisomeric products, known as the *endo* and *exo* adducts, are possible.\n*   The **endo rule** of the Diels-Alder reaction predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major product (formed faster, i.e., the kinetic product), while the *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n*   Let's visualize the structures of the two products:\n    *   **Major Product (Endo Adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same face (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond (the larger bridge with the methyl groups) and on the opposite face (*anti*) of the one-carbon CH₂ bridge. This geometry places the protons on the anhydride part of the molecule spatially close to the protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo Adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same face (*syn*) as the CH₂ bridge and *anti* to the double bond. This geometry places the anhydride protons spatially close to the methyl groups.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the 2D NOESY NMR Data**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR experiment that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (*endo*) isomer. Based on our analysis in Step 2, this unique spatial relationship is the proximity between the **anhydride protons** and the **protons of the CH₂ bridge**. The proximity between the anhydride protons and the methyl groups would be characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\n*   Now we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the product structure. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** There are two of them, and they are equivalent due to symmetry. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, making them relatively deshielded. They do not have any adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is a very reasonable assignment.\n    *   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** The CH₂ bridge contains two non-equivalent (diastereotopic) protons. They will couple only to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as a pair of doublets. The signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** represents one of these two bridge protons.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. The plane of symmetry makes them fall into two sets of two equivalent methyls. This will give rise to two signals, each integrating to 6H. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** are the signals for these methyl groups.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The unique NOESY cross-peak observed only in the major (*endo*) product must connect the anhydride protons and the CH₂ bridge protons.\n*   Matching our signal assignments:\n    *   Anhydride protons = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   CH₂ bridge proton = **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **The Dienophile (from the dicarboxylic acid):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a highly symmetrical structure, as indicated by its NMR data:\n        *   `1H NMR`: A single peak at 7.0 ppm. This means all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift is in the vinylic region.\n        *   `13C NMR`: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This indicates only two types of carbons are present.\n        *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). The two vinylic protons are equivalent, as are the two vinylic carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n        ```\n            O\n           / \\\n        HC = CH\n        |    |\n       C=O  C=O\n         \\  /\n          O\n        Maleic Anhydride\n        ```\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated system.\n\n        ```\n            Me  Me\n             |   |\n           C===C\n          /     \\\n      Me-C       C-Me\n        \\\\     //\n          CH2\n        1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\n        ```\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored and often the **minor product**.\n    *   Let's draw the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The products will have a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C9H14 (diene) + C4H2O3 (dienophile) = **C13H16O3**, which matches the problem statement.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (C7). The two protons from the maleic anhydride (let's call them H_a) are tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n\n         \n        *In the endo product, the anhydride protons (H_a, in blue) are spatially close to the syn-proton on the C7 bridge (H_syn, in red).*\n\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (C7). The H_a protons are pointing away from the bridge.\n\n         \n        *In the exo product, the anhydride protons (H_a, in blue) are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (in green).*\n\n3.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This cross-peak must correspond to a spatial proximity that exists only, or primarily, in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   Based on the structures above:\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, there is a close proximity between the anhydride protons (**H_a**) and the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge (**H_syn**). A NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, H_a and H_syn are far apart. Instead, H_a are close to the methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_alkene**).\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak observed in the major product is the one connecting **H_a** and **H_syn**.\n\n4.  **Assign NMR Signals and Identify the Correct Option**\n\n    *   We need to match the protons (H_a and H_syn) to the NMR signal descriptions given in the options.\n        *   **Protons from the anhydride (H_a):** These two protons are chemically equivalent and are alpha to the bridgehead carbons, which have no protons. Thus, they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Being alpha to carbonyls in a strained ring, their chemical shift will be downfield, around 3-4 ppm. This matches the **\"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"**.\n        *   **Bridge protons (C7-H):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (*syn* and *anti*). They are coupled only to each other (geminal coupling), so they appear as two separate doublets. The problem mentions **\"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\"**. This is a perfect description for one of these bridge protons (likely H_syn).\n        *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Me_alkene):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at ~1.6-2.0 ppm. This matches the **\"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\"**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons are equivalent. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a more upfield position, ~1.0-1.5 ppm. This matches the **\"6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm\"**.\n\n    *   The cross-peak in the major product is between H_a and H_syn. This corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This matches our conclusion for the major (*endo*) product.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This would be the characteristic cross-peak for the minor (*exo*) product (H_a <=> Me_alkene).\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls, which is not the key distinguishing feature.\n        *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridgehead methyl and a bridge proton. This interaction would be present in both isomers.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that describes the NOE interaction unique to the major (*endo*) product, which is between the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction:**\n*   The problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The single proton peak corresponds to the two equivalent alkene protons, and the two carbon peaks correspond to the two equivalent alkene carbons and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n*   This anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**2. Determination of the Major and Minor Products:**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   Generally, the *endo* product is favored kinetically due to secondary orbital interactions. However, significant steric hindrance can cause the more sterically stable *exo* product to be favored.\n*   In this specific reaction, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. These groups create substantial steric hindrance, which overrides the normal *endo* preference. Consequently, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Product Structures and NOESY Spectra:**\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically less than 5 Å apart). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) and far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are one pair of equivalent methyl groups. Given their chemical shift, they are likely the methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system (Me_alkene).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** This is the other pair of equivalent methyl groups, located at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity in the Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the one-carbon (CH₂) bridge and toward the C=C double bond. This places the H_anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) in close proximity to the Me_alkene groups (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented toward the CH₂ bridge and away from the C=C double bond. This makes the distance between the H_anhydride protons and the Me_alkene groups large. Thus, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl groups. This corresponds to the resonances at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying the reactants, the reaction type, the products' stereochemistry, and finally interpreting NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Anhydride\n\n*   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n*   The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n*   The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (characteristic of a C=C carbon) and 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl C=O carbon). Two peaks indicate a high degree of symmetry.\n*   These data points unequivocally identify the anhydride as **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), which matches the spectral data. The formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Diene and the Reaction\n\n*   The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene (the cyclopentadiene derivative) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   The problem states the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. A Diels-Alder reaction is an addition reaction, so the product's formula should be the sum of the reactants' formulas.\n    *   Maleic Anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n    *   Product - Anhydride = Diene Formula\n    *   C₁₃H₁₆O₃ - C₄H₂O₃ = C₉H₁₄\n*   Therefore, the diene must have the formula **C₉H₁₄**.\n*   The named diene \"1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\" could refer to several tautomers. We need to find the C₉H₁₄ isomer that fits. A plausible structure that is a conjugated diene and matches the formula C₉H₁₄ is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene where C5 has two methyl groups (gem-dimethyl), or a similar isomer. However, this leads to an asymmetric product, which complicates the NMR interpretation unnecessarily and contradicts the simplicity of the signals given in the options (e.g., 6H singlets).\n*   A more likely scenario is that there is a typo in the product's molecular formula and it should be **C₁₃H₁₈O₃**. This would result from a diene with the formula **C₉H₁₆**. A highly symmetric C₉H₁₆ tautomer is **2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene**. This diene has a C₂ axis of symmetry. Let's proceed with this assumption as it leads to a symmetric product whose predicted NMR spectra match the data provided in the options.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction of the symmetric diene (2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene) with maleic anhydride yields a symmetric bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. According to the Alder-endo rule, the **endo product is typically the major product** (formed faster), while the *exo* product is the minor one.\n*   **Structure of the Adduct:**\n    *   It has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   Four methyl groups: two on the bridgehead carbons and two on the vinylic carbons (of the new double bond). Due to symmetry, these appear as two distinct 6H singlets.\n    *   A CH₂ group forms the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   An anhydride ring is fused to the structure. The two protons on this part of the ring (originating from maleic anhydride) are now on saturated carbons. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent and appear as a 2H singlet.\n*   **Stereochemical Difference:**\n    *   In the **endo product (major)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge. This brings the anhydride protons very close in space to the bridge protons.\n    *   In the **exo product (minor)**, the anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the CH₂ bridge. The anhydride protons are far from the bridge protons.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectrum\n\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   This diagnostic cross-peak must connect protons that are close only in the *endo* isomer. Based on our structural analysis, this corresponds to the interaction between the **anhydride protons** and the **CH₂ bridge protons**.\n*   We need to find the option that describes the resonances for these two groups of protons.\n\n### Step 5: Predict the ¹H NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** These two equivalent protons are on carbons alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. Their chemical shift is expected to be around **~3.5 ppm**. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with (on the main framework), they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **CH₂ Bridge Protons:** These two protons are diastereotopic (one *syn*, one *anti* to the double bond) and will appear as two distinct signals. They couple to each other (geminal coupling), so each appears as a doublet (or more complex multiplet if other long-range couplings are present). Their chemical shift is typically in the aliphatic region, around **~1.5 ppm**. Each signal integrates to 1H.\n*   The crucial NOESY cross-peak therefore connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** with one of the **1H signals around ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our analysis. The 1H doublet is one of the bridge protons, and the 2H singlet corresponds to the anhydride protons. This cross-peak would be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is a cross-peak between a methyl group and a bridge proton. This interaction would be present in both *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is a cross-peak between a vinylic methyl group and the anhydride protons. This interaction would be stronger in the *exo* (minor) product, which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups. The distance is fixed in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with the principles of the Diels-Alder reaction and NOESY spectroscopy is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Identification of the Reactants\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons, fitting the spectral data.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups on the double bond carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition\n\nThe reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Because the reactants are planar, the dienophile can approach the diene from two different faces, leading to two possible diastereomeric products:\n\n*   ***endo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions (kinetic control).\n*   ***exo* product:** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7 bridge. This is usually the minor product.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given in the question.\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of Products for NOESY Spectroscopy\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two proton signals indicates their spatial proximity. The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This must correspond to a spatial relationship that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n\n*   **In the major (*endo*) product:** The protons from the maleic anhydride part (located at the C2 and C3 positions of the bicyclic system) are on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings them very close to the protons of the CH₂ group at the C7 position. Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak is expected between the C2/C3 protons and the C7 protons.\n\n*   **In the minor (*exo*) product:** The C2/C3 protons are on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The distance between these protons is much larger, so the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\nThis confirms that the differential cross-peak connects the resonances of the **C2/C3 anhydride protons** and the **C7 bridge protons**.\n\n### 4. Assignment of ¹H NMR Signals\n\nNow, we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the specific protons in the major product.\n\n*   **Protons from the Anhydride (C2-H, C3-H):** These are two equivalent protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift is typically downfield, around 3-4 ppm. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment for these protons. They appear as a singlet due to the plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n\n*   **Protons on the C7 Bridge:** This is a CH₂ group. In the rigid bicyclic system, these two protons are diastereotopic (not chemically equivalent). They couple to each other (geminal coupling), typically resulting in a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). One of these protons, the *syn* proton, points towards the C2/C3 positions in the *endo* adduct. This proton is the one that will show the NOE. The question describes one of these signals as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This is a plausible chemical shift for a bridge proton in a bicyclo[2.2.1] system and correctly identifies it as one of the two non-equivalent C7 protons.\n\n*   **Other Signals:**\n    *   **Alkene Methyls (on C5=C6):** These two equivalent methyl groups (6H total) are on a double bond, typically resonating around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (on C1, C4):** These two equivalent methyl groups (6H total) are on saturated carbons. They are more shielded and resonate further upfield, corresponding to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe key cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product, which is absent in the minor (*exo*) product, connects the anhydride protons (C2-H, C3-H) with the C7 bridge protons. Based on the signal assignments:\n\n*   Anhydride protons = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C7 bridge proton = **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The description is of a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride shows a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high symmetry points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups at all four sp² positions (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the sp³ position (C5).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct with a molecular formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene: C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride: C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the information given.\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n        *   The bridgeheads are the original C1 and C4 of the diene.\n        *   One bridge is the original C2 and C3 of the diene, now a -C(Me)=C(Me)- group.\n        *   The other bridge is the original C5 of the diene, now a -CH₂- group.\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused to the remaining two carbons of the newly formed six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Products**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. A major and minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature for bicyclo[2.2.1] systems, the smaller bridge is the one-carbon (-CH₂-) bridge.\n        *   The **exo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the small (-CH₂-) bridge.\n        *   The **endo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the small bridge, meaning it is *syn* to the larger -C(Me)=C(Me)- bridge.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major kinetic product, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   However, the presence of four bulky methyl groups on the diene creates significant steric hindrance. The *endo* transition state involves a clash between the anhydride's carbonyl groups and the methyl groups on C2 and C3 of the diene. The *exo* transition state is less hindered. In such highly substituted systems, it's possible for sterics to override the electronic preference, making the *exo* product the major one.\n    *   **Key Clue from NMR Data:** The problem provides spectroscopic details that help determine the major product's identity without ambiguity. The protons on the carbons bearing the anhydride functionality are described as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. In bicyclo[2.2.1] systems, *exo* protons often exhibit \"W-coupling\" (a 4-bond coupling) with other protons on the rigid framework, which would split the signal from a singlet. *Endo* protons are typically too far from other protons to show this coupling. The fact that the signal is a **singlet** is strong evidence that these are *endo* protons.\n    *   Therefore, the major product is the **endo adduct**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum of the Major (Endo) Product**\n    *   NOESY cross-peaks indicate protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). We need to find protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n    *   In the **endo adduct** (the major product), the anhydride ring is on the same side as the -C(Me)=C(Me)- bridge.\n    *   This means the two protons on the anhydride-bearing carbons (the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**) are spatially close to the methyl groups on that bridge (the vinyl methyls).\n    *   Let's assign the chemical shifts given in the options:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on the carbons adjacent to the anhydride.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinyl methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Their chemical shift is in the typical range for vinylic methyls.\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Bridgehead methyl groups. Their chemical shift is typical for methyls on saturated carbons.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two diastereotopic protons of the -CH₂- bridge.\n\n    *   The key spatial proximity in the major (*endo*) product is between the protons at ~3.5 ppm and the vinyl methyl groups at ~1.7 ppm. This interaction would be absent in the minor (*exo*) product, where the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the molecule.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The major product is the *endo* adduct, as evidenced by the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   In the *endo* adduct, the protons corresponding to the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm are close to the vinyl methyl groups, which correspond to the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects these two resonances.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Anhydride**: A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   The single ¹H NMR peak indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are part of a conjugated and electron-deficient system.\n    *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest two different types of carbon atoms. The peak at ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   These spectral data are perfectly consistent with **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). Due to symmetry, its two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving a single ¹H NMR signal. It has two equivalent carbonyl carbons and two equivalent alkene carbons, giving two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction**: The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition where the cyclopentadiene derivative acts as the diene and maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**: The Diels-Alder reaction typically yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. The reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3, which is the sum of the reactants (Maleic anhydride: C4H2O3; Diene: C9H14). This confirms it is an addition reaction.\n    *   ***Endo* product**: This is generally the major product under kinetic control because of favorable secondary orbital interactions during the transition state. In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the double bond of the bicyclic system.\n    *   ***Exo* product**: This is typically the minor product but is thermodynamically more stable due to less steric hindrance. In this isomer, the anhydride ring points away from the double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Signals and NOESY Correlation**: The question describes a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum of the major product that is absent in the minor product. NOESY cross-peaks indicate that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major product) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor product).\n\n    *   **Proton Assignments in the Product**:\n        *   `H_anhydride`: The two protons originating from maleic anhydride. They are equivalent and appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. They are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyls.\n        *   `Me_bridge`: The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Expected as a **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   `Me_vinyl`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. Expected as a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   `H_bridge`: The two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). They would appear as two separate signals, each a doublet due to geminal coupling. The *anti*-proton (pointing away from the double bond, towards the anhydride in the *endo* case) is typically more shielded (upfield shift) than the *syn*-proton. The signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to the shielded `H_bridge_anti`.\n\n    *   **NOE Analysis in the *Endo* (Major) Isomer**: In the *endo* structure, the anhydride ring is on the *endo* face, \"under\" the rest of the molecule. This brings the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the `H_bridge_anti` proton (~1.5 ppm), which points down from the C7 bridge. Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n    *   **NOE Analysis in the *Exo* (Minor) Isomer**: In the *exo* structure, the anhydride ring is on the *exo* face, pointing away. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far from the `H_bridge_anti` proton. Thus, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: The observation of a strong cross-peak in the major product and its absence in the minor product uniquely corresponds to the spatial interaction between the anhydride protons and the anti-bridge proton.\n\n*   **Matching with Options**: The cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`H_anhydride`) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (`H_bridge_anti`). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The simplest example is maleic acid, which dehydrates to form maleic anhydride. The provided NMR data for the anhydride confirms this structure:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride is a symmetrical molecule (C₄H₂O₃). The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single peak. The given shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons. This results in two peaks. The shifts at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) are consistent with this structure.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   **Product Formula:** The formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction typically yields two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n*   The **endo product** is usually the major product due to kinetic control arising from favorable secondary orbital interactions. In this isomer, the anhydride group is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the bicyclic system. In this specific case, it's *syn* to the C7-methylene bridge.\n*   The **exo product** is the minor product. Here, the anhydride group is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-methylene bridge.\n\nThe problem states a NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n\n### **Step 3: Assign Proton NMR Signals**\nLet's assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the product structure (1,4,5,6-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride).\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them **Hₐ**). They are adjacent to the bridgehead carbons and the carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (**vinylic methyls**). Vinylic methyl protons typically resonate in this region.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (**bridgehead methyls**). These alkyl protons are relatively shielded.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. In norbornene systems, the bridge proton that is *anti* to the double bond is typically found around this chemical shift.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze NOESY Correlations in Endo vs. Exo Isomers**\nNOESY spectroscopy shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In this structure, the **Hₐ** protons are on the same face of the molecule as the C7-bridge. Specifically, they are very close to the *anti* proton of the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between **Hₐ** and this bridge proton.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In this structure, the **Hₐ** protons are on the opposite face of the molecule from the C7-bridge. They are now far away from the C7-bridge protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, the *exo* protons become close to the bridgehead methyl groups (~1.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*endo*) product connects the **Hₐ** protons with the *anti*-C7 bridge proton. Based on our signal assignments, this is a correlation between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the provided chemistry problem about a Diels-Alder reaction and NMR spectroscopy.\n\n    The steps are:\n    1.

This results in a cyclic anhydride.\n    *   ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in a highly deshielded environment, characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only one peak for each type of carbon indicates high symmetry.\n    *   The only structure that fits all these criteria is **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data. Its formula is C₄H₂O₃.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The other reactant is specified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's verify its molecular formula. A cyclopentadiene ring has 5 carbons. Four methyl groups (4 x CH₃) are attached. So, the total number of carbons is 5 + 4 = 9.\n    *   The base cyclopentadiene (C₅H₆) has two hydrogens on the CH₂ carbon and one hydrogen on each of the four sp² carbons. In the tetramethyl derivative, the four hydrogens on the sp² carbons are replaced by methyl groups. The CH₂ group remains.\n    *   So, the hydrogens are: 2 (from the CH₂ group) + 4 * 3 (from the methyl groups) = 14 hydrogens.\n    *   The formula for the diene is **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n*   **Product Formula:** The product is formed by combining the two reactants. C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. In kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the **endo product is typically the major product**, and the **exo product is the minor product**.\n\n    *   **Endo Product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (\"syn\") of the newly formed bicyclic system as the double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Exo Product:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (\"anti\") of the bicyclic system from the double bond (C=C).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** A NOESY experiment detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction), even if they are not bonded or coupled. A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are spatially close (typically < 5 Å).\n*   **The Key Information:** A cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   In the **endo isomer (major product)**, the anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the bicyclic framework, placing its two protons (H_anhydride) close to the methyl groups attached to the double bond (Me_vinyl).\n    *   In the **exo isomer (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the double bond. Its two protons (H_anhydride) are far from the vinylic methyl groups (Me_vinyl). Instead, they are close to the CH₂ bridge of the bicyclic system.\n*   **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major (endo) product and weak/absent in the minor (exo) product must be between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **Me_vinyl protons**.\n\n**Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nWe need to match the proton groups to the chemical shifts given in the options.\n\n*   **Protons on the anhydride moiety (H_anhydride):** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups, which is a deshielding environment. They are equivalent by symmetry. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinyl):** These are vinylic methyl groups. A typical chemical shift for such groups is in the range of 1.6-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead):** These are methyl groups on saturated, tertiary carbons in a strained ring system. A shift around 1 ppm is reasonable. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n*   **Protons on the CH₂ bridge (H_bridge):** These are protons on a saturated carbon in a strained ring. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these two protons (they are non-equivalent).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Cross-Peak**\n\nBased on our analysis, the unique cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the H_anhydride protons with the Me_vinyl protons.\n\n*   Signal for H_anhydride: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Signal for Me_vinyl: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonances at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\n**Step 6: Match with the Options**\n\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_bridge and H_anhydride). This interaction would be strong in the *exo* product, not the *endo*.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Me_bridgehead and H_bridge). This interaction is not the primary differentiator between *endo* and *exo*.\n*   C) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (Me_vinyl and H_anhydride). This matches our conclusion perfectly. This interaction is strong in the *endo* (major) product and weak/absent in the *exo* (minor) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_bridgehead and Me_vinyl). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum (all protons are equivalent) at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (two types of carbons) at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The simplest cis-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check if the NMR data matches maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n            *   ¹H NMR: It has two chemically equivalent protons on the double bond. They would appear as a singlet. A shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons flanked by electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n            *   ¹³C NMR: It has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). This leads to two signals. A carbonyl carbon resonance around 165 ppm and a vinyl carbon resonance around 137 ppm are very typical.\n        *   Thus, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is between a diene and a dienophile, which is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n        *   The molecular formula of the product would be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclopentadiene derivative and a cyclic dienophile produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   This reaction can lead to two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n        *   The *endo* product is formed when the dienophile approaches the diene such that its electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride part) are tucked underneath the diene's π-system. This orientation is favored by secondary orbital overlap and is typically the **kinetically controlled major product**.\n        *   The *exo* product has the anhydride part oriented away from the diene's π-system. It is sterically less hindered and is typically the **thermodynamically controlled product**, often the minor product under standard conditions.\n    *   Since the problem mentions a major and a minor product, it's safe to assume we have formed both the *endo* and *exo* adducts, with the **major product being the *endo* isomer**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   First, let's identify the different types of protons in the product and assign the signals given in the options. The product has a plane of symmetry in both isomers.\n        *   **Vinyl methyls (Me_v):** Two CH₃ groups on the C=C bond. Equivalent by symmetry. (6H total). Vinyl methyl protons typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyls (Me_b):** Two CH₃ groups on the bridgehead carbons. Equivalent by symmetry. (6H total). These are on saturated carbons and should be more shielded than the vinyl methyls. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_a):** Two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. Equivalent by symmetry. (2H total). These protons are alpha to two carbonyl groups, making them highly deshielded. Let's assign this to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge protons (CH₂):** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7) are diastereotopic and not equivalent. They would appear as two distinct 1H signals (likely complex multiplets or doublets of doublets). One of these could correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** mentioned in some options.\n\n4.  **Compare Interproton Distances in *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers**\n\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** In the *endo* isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* to the CH₂ bridge, meaning it is tucked \"underneath\" the newly formed six-membered ring, towards the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Spatial Proximity:** The anhydride protons (**H_a**) are spatially close to the protons on the double bond, which are the **vinyl methyl groups (Me_v)**. A strong NOE cross-peak between H_a and Me_v is expected.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_a) are far from the CH₂ bridge protons. An NOE cross-peak is not expected.\n\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** In the *exo* isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* to the CH₂ bridge, pointing \"away\" from the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Spatial Proximity:** The anhydride protons (**H_a**) are now far from the **vinyl methyl groups (Me_v)**. The NOE cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_a) are now spatially close to the **CH₂ bridge protons**. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n\n5.  **Identify the Differentiating Cross-Peak**\n    *   The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** (*endo*) but **absent in the minor product** (*exo*).\n    *   Based on our analysis, this is the cross-peak between the **anhydride protons (H_a)** and the **vinyl methyl protons (Me_v)**.\n\n6.  **Match the Protons to the NMR Signals in the Options**\n    *   Vinyl methyl protons (Me_v) = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   Anhydride protons (H_a) = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects these two signals.\n\n    This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n    *   Let's review the other options:\n        *   A) Me_b and a bridge proton: This NOE should be present in both isomers.\n        *   B) A bridge proton and H_a: This NOE is characteristic of the *minor* (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n        *   C) Me_b and Me_v: This NOE should be present in both isomers as they are on adjacent carbons.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes a cross-peak unique to the major product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem that involves identifying reactants from spectral data, predicting the outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction, and using 2D NMR spectroscopy to determine the stereochemistry of the products.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Dienophile (Anhydride):**\n    *   The problem describes an anhydride formed from the dehydration of a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid.\n    *   This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent. This is characteristic of the two vinylic protons in maleic anhydride.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) and 137 ppm (alkene carbons), which is also consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Diene:**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n3.  **The Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomeric products are possible: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts. According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* is the minor, thermodynamically favored product.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Product Structures and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **Products:** Both the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products will have the same molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n    *   **¹H NMR Signals:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, we expect:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons on the part of the molecule derived from maleic anhydride.\n        *   Two 1H signals (likely doublets due to geminal coupling) for the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Chemical Shift Assignments (Approximate):**\n        *   Anhydride protons (2H singlet): These protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system. A shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable.\n        *   Vinylic methyls (6H singlet): Methyl groups on a double bond typically appear around 1.7-2.0 ppm.\n        *   Bridgehead methyls (6H singlet): Methyl groups on saturated carbons appear further upfield, ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n        *   Bridge protons (CH₂): These are on a saturated carbon in a bicyclic system, often appearing between 1.0-2.0 ppm. A shift of ~1.5 ppm is plausible for one of them.\n\n5.  **Interpreting the 2D NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This is the key to distinguishing the isomers and answering the question. We must find protons that are close in the *endo* (major) isomer but far apart in the *exo* (minor) isomer.\n    *   ***Endo* isomer:** The anhydride part of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the main ring system. This brings the two anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and also close to the *syn* proton of the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* isomer:** The anhydride part points \"away\" from the main ring system. This moves the anhydride protons far from the vinylic methyls and the *syn* bridge proton.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present (or much stronger) in the *endo* isomer will be between the anhydride protons and the groups on the same face of the molecule. Both the vinylic methyls and one of the bridge protons are potential candidates.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be a correlation between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. Their relative distance is similar in both isomers.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This describes an interaction between one of the CH₂ bridge protons and the anhydride protons. This is a very strong diagnostic correlation for the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** An interaction between the bridgehead methyls and a CH₂ bridge proton. Their distance is similar in both isomers.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This describes an interaction between the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This correlation would also be present in the *endo* isomer and absent in the *exo*.\n\n7.  **Final Decision (B vs. D):**\n    Both options B and D describe valid NOE correlations that would be present in the *endo* product and absent in the *exo*. However, in many Diels-Alder adducts of this type, the most commonly cited and diagnostically reliable NOE for identifying the *endo* isomer is the one between the anhydride protons and the protons on the bicyclic framework that are held in close proximity, such as the vinylic substituents or the bridge protons. In this specific case, with four methyl groups substituting the diene, the interaction between the anhydride protons and the nearby vinylic methyl groups is a very clear and expected NOE. The chemical shifts provided in option D align perfectly with the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm). This interaction represents a clear spatial proximity between 6 protons and 2 protons, which would result in a significant cross-peak.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the vinylic methyl singlet and the anhydride proton singlet.\n\nFinal check of assignments:\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Vinylic methyl groups.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Anhydride protons.\n\nThese two groups are close in the major (*endo*) product and far apart in the minor (*exo*) product, giving rise to the described NOESY cross-peak.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe reaction described is a classic Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak for its protons (¹H NMR at 7 ppm) and only two peaks for its carbons (¹³C NMR at 137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons). This high degree of symmetry confirms the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the four carbons of the diene system and a CH₂ group at the 5th position.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride yields a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   Due to the \"endo rule\" in Diels-Alder reactions, two stereoisomers are typically formed: the *endo* product (major) and the *exo* product (minor). The endo-isomer is favored because of stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the newly forming double bond of the diene in the transition state.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Analysis and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is observed in the 2D NOESY spectrum of the major product but is absent in the minor product. NOESY shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds. This technique is ideal for distinguishing between *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n    *   Let's analyze the expected proton signals and their spatial relationships in both isomers:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methine protons (CH) on the part of the molecule that came from maleic anhydride. They are alpha to the carbonyl groups, hence their downfield shift.\n        *   **Two 6H singlets at ~1.7 ppm and ~1.0 ppm:** These correspond to the four methyl groups. The two methyl groups on the double bond of the product are vinylic and appear at a lower field (~1.7 ppm). The other two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons and appear at a higher field (~1.0 ppm).\n        *   **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge (the CH₂ group from the original diene). These two protons are non-equivalent. The key to distinguishing the isomers is their proximity to other protons.\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the larger bridge, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 methylene bridge. This geometry brings the methine protons from the anhydride (~3.5 ppm) close to the C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring points away from the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the methine protons from the anhydride are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the methine protons from the anhydride and a C7 bridge proton is expected to be present and strong for the *endo* (major) product and absent or very weak for the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the two sets of protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* configuration. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride methine protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that connects the resonances for the anhydride methine protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and a C7 bridge proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Reaction Analysis\n\nThe reaction described is a classic Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n1.  **Dienophile Identification**: A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid was dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride shows a single proton peak at 7 ppm and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃). The two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two vinylic carbons and the two carbonyl carbons, consistent with the observed NMR spectra.\n\n2.  **Diene Identification**: The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Reaction and Products**: The Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene yields an adduct with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄). Due to the stereochemistry of the cycloaddition, two diastereomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The Diels-Alder reaction is under kinetic control, and secondary orbital overlap stabilizes the *endo* transition state, making the **endo adduct the major product** and the **exo adduct the minor product**.\n\n### NMR and NOESY Analysis\n\nThe question hinges on identifying a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum that is present for the major product but absent for the minor product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5Å).\n\n*   **Major (Endo) Product**: In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride portion of the molecule is situated \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring. This geometry brings the two protons from the original maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_alkane**) very close to the two methyl groups on the double bond (the \"inner\" methyls, **Me_inner**).\n*   **Minor (Exo) Product**: In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride portion is flipped away from the cyclohexene ring. In this arrangement, the **H_alkane** protons are far from the **Me_inner** groups.\n\nTherefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the **H_alkane** protons and the **Me_inner** protons will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent or very weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This is the key distinguishing feature.\n\n### Chemical Shift Predictions\n\nTo match this interaction with the given options, we must predict the signals for these protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n\n1.  **H_alkane protons**: These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups within a strained bicyclic system. They have no adjacent protons to couple with (the bridgehead carbons are quaternary, each bearing a methyl group). Thus, they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their position alpha to two carbonyls places their chemical shift significantly downfield, reasonably at **~3.5 ppm**.\n\n2.  **Me_inner protons**: These are the two methyl groups attached directly to the C=C double bond in the product. They are equivalent by symmetry. Vinylic methyl groups typically resonate in the range of 1.6-2.2 ppm. They would appear as a **6H singlet**. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** is appropriate.\n\n3.  **Other Protons**:\n    *   **Me_outer protons**: The two methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons are on saturated, quaternary centers. They would be a **6H singlet** at a more shielded (upfield) position, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **H_bridge protons**: The two protons on the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic and would likely appear as two distinct **1H doublets** (due to geminal coupling).\n\n### Matching Predictions to Options\n\nWe are looking for the NOESY cross-peak connecting **H_alkane** and **Me_inner**. Based on our predictions:\n\n*   **H_alkane**: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   **Me_inner**: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nThis corresponds directly to option C.\n\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_bridge and H_alkane)\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_outer and Me_inner)\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Me_inner and H_alkane)**\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Me_outer and H_bridge)\n\nThe interaction described in option C is the most characteristic NOE for assigning the *endo* stereochemistry in this type of Diels-Alder adduct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A \"dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride.\" This describes the conversion of maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) to maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n        *   Let's verify its NMR data. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, so the two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum (given as 7 ppm). The four carbons are of two types: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, leading to two peaks in the ¹³C spectrum (given as 137 ppm for C=C and 165 ppm for C=O). This confirms the dienophile is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of these four carbons has a methyl group. Position 5 is a CH₂ group. The chemical formula for this diene is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) reacts with the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of the product. Adding the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ gives C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the molecular formula given in the problem, confirming our reactant structures.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The *endo* product is usually the major product because it is formed faster (kinetically favored due to secondary orbital overlap). The *exo* product is usually the minor product because it is more stable (thermodynamically favored due to less steric hindrance). The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. We can confidently assign the major product as the *endo* adduct and the minor product as the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the Major (*endo*) and Minor (*exo*) Products**\n    *   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. Due to the symmetry of both the diene and the dienophile, the resulting adducts also possess a plane of symmetry. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n    *   There will be four distinct sets of protons in the product, and due to symmetry, all of them should appear as singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        1.  **Alkene Methyl Protons (H_Me_a):** Two methyl groups attached to the newly formed double bond. Total of 6H.\n        2.  **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (H_Me_b):** Two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (where the new C-C bonds formed). Total of 6H.\n        3.  **Anhydride Protons (H_anhydride):** Two protons on the fused anhydride ring. Total of 2H.\n        4.  **Bridge Methylene Protons (H_bridge):** Two protons of the CH₂ bridge from the original cyclopentadiene. Total of 2H.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the bicyclic system, on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge. This places the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) in close proximity to the protons of the alkene methyl groups (H_Me_a).\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride ring is on the same side as the CH₂ bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons (H_anhydride) are far from the alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a) but are close to the bridge methylene protons (H_bridge).\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of J-coupling.\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis in step 3, the pair of protons that fits this description is the **anhydride protons (H_anhydride)** and the **alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a)**. This interaction will be strong in the *endo* product and very weak or absent in the *exo* product.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals and Select the Correct Answer**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options to the proton groups we identified.\n        *   A **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: This corresponds to the bridgehead methyl protons (H_Me_b). These are on saturated carbons and are expected to be the most shielded (lowest chemical shift).\n        *   A **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: This corresponds to the alkene methyl protons (H_Me_a). Methyl groups on a double bond are deshielded relative to those on saturated carbons, so their shift is higher.\n        *   A **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: This corresponds to the anhydride protons (H_anhydride). These protons are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in a strained ring, which significantly deshields them, resulting in a high chemical shift.\n        *   (The descriptions in options B and C mention a \"1H doublet\", which is inconsistent with the highly symmetric structure of the product where all signals should be singlets. We can disregard these options as likely containing typos or being deliberately incorrect.)\n\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n    *   Using our assignments, this corresponds to the signals at **~3.5 ppm (2H, singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H, singlet)**.\n\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\n    *   Option D perfectly matches the two signals we identified as being spatially close in the major product: the alkene methyl protons (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n**1. Deconstruction of the problem:**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   ¹H NMR: single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift is in the vinylic region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C=C) and 165 ppm (anhydride carbonyl C=O). The presence of only two signals indicates high molecular symmetry.\n    *   These spectral data and the formation from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid uniquely identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons (hence one ¹H signal) and, by symmetry, two equivalent vinylic carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (hence two ¹³C signals). The chemical shifts are characteristic for this compound.\n\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   Formula: C₉H₁₄.\n\n*   **Reaction:** A Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product matches the one given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored (major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   The *exo* product is usually the thermodynamically more stable (minor) product as it is sterically less hindered.\n\n*   **Products & Spectroscopy:**\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   A 2D NOESY experiment shows a cross-peak (indicating spatial proximity, < 5Å) in the major product that is absent or very weak in the minor product. We need to identify the protons responsible for this cross-peak.\n\n**2. Structural Analysis of Products:**\n\nThe reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. Let's analyze the proton signals we expect from the product's structure, which possesses a plane of symmetry:\n*   **H_α protons (2H singlet):** These are the two protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. Due to the plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will appear as a singlet. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3-4 ppm) as they are adjacent to carbonyl groups. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Vinylic methyl protons (Me_vinyl, 6H singlet):** These are the methyl groups on the C=C double bond of the product. They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a singlet. Their chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyl groups (~1.5-2.0 ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead, 6H singlet):** These are the methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a singlet. Their shift will be further upfield (~1.0-1.5 ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n*   **Methylene bridge protons (CH₂, two 1H signals):** The two protons on the C7 bridge are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are not equivalent and should appear as two distinct signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. One of these corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**3. NOESY Analysis (Spatial Proximity):**\n\nWe are looking for protons that are close in space in the *endo* (major) product but far apart in the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (\"syn\" or \"under\") the C=C double bond.\n    *   In this conformation, the **H_α protons** are spatially close to the **Me_vinyl groups**. This will generate a strong NOESY cross-peak.\n    *   The **H_α protons** are also close to the *anti* proton of the CH₂ bridge. This will also generate an NOESY cross-peak.\n\n*   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (\"anti\" or \"above\") of the C=C double bond.\n    *   In this conformation, the **H_α protons** are far from the **Me_vinyl groups**. The NOESY cross-peak will be absent.\n    *   The **H_α protons** are also far from the *anti* proton of the CH₂ bridge. This NOESY cross-peak will also be absent.\n\n**4. Matching Analysis to Options:**\n\nThe question describes a cross-peak present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product. Based on our analysis, two such interactions exist:\n1.  Between **H_α** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet).\n2.  Between **H_α** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and the ***anti*-bridge proton** (~1.5 ppm, 1H doublet).\n\nThese correspond to options B and A, respectively.\n*   **Option B:** A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_α).\n*   **Option A:** A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one of the bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_α).\n\nWhile both cross-peaks are valid markers for the *endo* isomer, the interaction between the H_α protons of the dienophile and the vinylic methyl groups of the diene is the most direct and classic evidence of the *endo* stereochemistry. Furthermore, the NOE signal intensity depends on the number of interacting protons. The interaction in Option B involves a group of 6 protons and a group of 2 protons, which would typically result in a stronger, more prominent cross-peak than the interaction in Option A (1 proton and 2 protons). Therefore, it is the most likely candidate for \"the\" characteristic cross-peak mentioned in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid which, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is provided:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        This data is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. Due to its symmetry, it has only one type of proton and two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**. We can verify the product's molecular formula:\n        *   Maleic anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n        *   Diene: C₉H₁₄\n        *   Product: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the information given.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Products**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** for Diels-Alder reactions predicts that the major product will be the *endo* adduct, as it is formed through a more stable transition state with secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **Major product = *endo* adduct**\n    *   **Minor product = *exo* adduct**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY Spectroscopy**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is *present* in the major product but *absent* (or very weak) in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n4.  **Compare Spatial Proximity in *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers**\n    *   Let's identify the key symmetrical proton groups in the product:\n        1.  **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n        2.  **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** The six protons of the two methyl groups attached to the double bond (at C2 and C3). They are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   Now, let's visualize the structures:\n        *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond. This geometry brings the **anhydride protons** very close to the **vinyl methyl protons**. Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **anhydride protons** are far from the **vinyl methyl protons**. No significant NOESY cross-peak would be observed between them.\n    *   This structural difference explains why the cross-peak is present in the major product and absent in the minor one. The distinguishing cross-peak must be between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n5.  **Assign Chemical Shifts and Identify the Correct Option**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts provided in the options to the identified proton groups:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the **anhydride protons**. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them to a higher chemical shift.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the **vinyl methyl protons**. This chemical shift is typical for methyl groups attached to a double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the signals at ~1.7 ppm and ~3.5 ppm.\n\n    *   Evaluating the given options:\n        *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our analysis. It describes the NOE between the vinyl methyl groups and the anhydride protons, which is characteristic of the *endo* adduct.\n        *   B), C), and D) describe other proton interactions that are either not the key distinguishing feature or would be present in both isomers (like the interaction between the two sets of methyl groups in option D).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **The Dienophile:** We start with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Dehydration of this acid gives an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   A single ¹H peak implies the protons are equivalent due to symmetry. A chemical shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons that are highly deshielded by electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride. The peak at 137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C). The presence of only two peaks indicates high symmetry.\n        *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, matching the NMR data perfectly. So, the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene, locked in the *s-cis* conformation necessary for a Diels-Alder reaction. The reacting carbons are C1 and C4, and the CH₂ group at C5 will become the one-carbon bridge in the product.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   Because the dienophile can approach the cyclic diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products are formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the **Alder endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* adduct, where the substituents on the dienophile (in this case, the anhydride ring) are tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring. The minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major Product (*endo* Adduct):**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n    *   There are methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) and on the alkene carbons (C5, C6).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the C2 and C3 positions.\n    *   In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7 methylene bridge (*syn* orientation).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the anhydride group. This simplifies the NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   Based on the structure and symmetry of the *endo* product, we can predict the ¹H NMR signals and assign the chemical shifts given in the options.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methine protons on the anhydride part of the molecule. They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** These are the protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are in a shielded environment. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two diastereotopic protons of the C7 methylene bridge. The other C7 proton would give a separate signal. They are split into doublets by geminal coupling. Let's call this one **H_bridge**.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The question asks for a cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* geometry but far apart in the *exo* geometry.\n    *   Let's compare the key distances in both isomers:\n        *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major):** The anhydride ring and the C7 bridge are on the same side of the molecule (*syn*). Therefore, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride ring and the C7 bridge are on opposite sides of the molecule (*anti*). Therefore, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. No significant NOE is expected. Conversely, in the *exo* adduct, the H_anhydride protons would be closer to the Me_alkene groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The differentiating cross-peak, which is present only in the major (*endo*) product, must connect the **H_anhydride** protons and one of the **H_bridge** protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene): These groups are too far apart for a significant NOE.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride): This NOE would be characteristic of the minor (*exo*) product, not the major one.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge): This interaction would likely be present in both isomers, so it's not the differentiating peak.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride): This interaction is uniquely strong in the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This high degree of symmetry and the spectral data are characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two equivalent protons on the double bond account for the single ¹H NMR peak, while the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons account for the two ¹³C NMR peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. This structure has methyl groups on the four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a methylene (CH₂) group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   This [4+2] cycloaddition typically produces two diastereomeric products: a major *endo* product and a minor *exo* product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structures:**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The carbons C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons of the product. They each have a methyl group attached.\n    *   The carbons C2 and C3 of the diene form the new double bond in the product. They each have a methyl group attached.\n    *   The maleic anhydride adds across the diene to form the rest of the bicyclic framework.\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in the product, we expect the following ¹H NMR signals:\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups.\n        *   A 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   A 2H singlet for the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (they are next to quaternary bridgehead carbons, so no coupling).\n        *   Two 1H signals for the two non-equivalent protons of the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   A cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   ***Endo* isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the newly formed C=C double bond. This places the anhydride protons (a 2H singlet) in close proximity to the vinylic methyl groups (a 6H singlet).\n    *   ***Exo* isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C double bond. In this orientation, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are closer to the C7 methylene bridge protons.\n\n5.  **Assign Resonances and Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The distinctive NOESY correlation in the major (*endo*) product will be between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Let's assign the chemical shifts given in the options based on typical values:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (2H singlet):** These protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons (6H singlet):** Methyl groups attached to a double bond typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. **~1.7 ppm** is a good fit.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (6H singlet):** These are on saturated, quaternary carbons and are expected to be more shielded. **~1.0 ppm** is a likely value.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (1H doublets):** The methylene bridge protons in norbornane systems appear around 1.2-1.8 ppm. **~1.5 ppm** fits this range.\n    *   The cross-peak unique to the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our shift assignments, this corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n\nTherefore, the two resonances connected by the cross-peak in the spectrum of the major product are the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle that requires identifying the reactants and products, understanding the reaction mechanism and its stereochemical outcome, and interpreting NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene containing dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This spectroscopic data is a classic fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent protons on the double bond give a single ¹H peak (in the typical range for vinylic protons), while the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) account for the two peaks in the ¹³C spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction and Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a quintessential **Diels-Alder reaction**, where the cyclopentadiene derivative acts as the diene and maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile. This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction typically forms two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. The formation of major and minor products aligns with this expectation.\n\n3.  **Molecular Formula Discrepancy:** There is a discrepancy between the stated molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) and the formula calculated from the reactants (Maleic Anhydride C₄H₂O₃ + Diene C₉H₁₂ = C₁₃H₁₄O₃). This is likely a typo in the problem statement. The core of the problem relies on the structure of the reactants and the principles of stereochemistry and NMR, so we proceed by assuming the named reactants are correct and the product is C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry and the \"Endo Rule\":** The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a cyclic dienophile usually favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions (the \"endo rule\"). This product forms faster and is known as the kinetic product. However, the *exo* product is often more sterically stable (the thermodynamic product). In this specific case, the diene has two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These methyl groups cause significant steric hindrance with the approaching maleic anhydride in the *endo* transition state. This steric clash can override the electronic preference for the *endo* product, leading to the *exo* product being formed faster and thus becoming the major product.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the NOESY Spectra:** A Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) cross-peak indicates that two protons (or sets of protons) are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. We must therefore identify a proton interaction that is unique to the *exo* adduct (the major product).\n\n    *   In the **exo adduct**, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicyclic system. This geometry brings the protons of the anhydride portion (let's call them **H-c**, a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) close to the vinylic methyl groups (the two methyl groups attached to the double bond).\n    *   In the **endo adduct** (the minor product), the anhydride ring is tucked under the bicyclic system, far from the vinylic methyls. Instead, the anhydride protons would be close to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Assigning the NMR Signals and Identifying the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   The two equivalent protons from the maleic anhydride moiety (**H-c**) are expected to appear as a **2H singlet around 3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The product has two sets of methyl groups: two equivalent *vinylic* methyls and two equivalent *bridgehead* methyls. Vinylic methyl groups are typically shifted further downfield (higher ppm) than aliphatic methyls. Therefore, the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is assigned to the vinylic methyls, while another 6H singlet for the bridgehead methyls would be expected at a higher field (e.g., ~1 ppm).\n    *   Since the major product is the *exo* adduct, the distinctive NOESY cross-peak connects the protons that are spatially close in this isomer: the anhydride protons (H-c) and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nThis corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice connects the resonances for the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR (indicating two equivalent vinyl protons) and two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C NMR. This spectroscopic data uniquely identifies the anhydride as maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is known to produce a bicyclic adduct. The total proton count in the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) is 16: 12 from the four methyl groups, 2 from the anhydride moiety, and 2 from the C5 position of the cyclopentadiene, which becomes the C7 bridge in the product.\n\n4.  **Consider Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** The Diels-Alder reaction can lead to two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The \"endo rule\" states that the kinetically favored product, which is typically the major product, is the *endo* isomer. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state.\n\n5.  **Predict Product Structures:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the one-carbon bridge (C7) and underneath the C-C double bond of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. This geometry places the two protons of the anhydride moiety (let's call them H_A) in close spatial proximity to the *syn* methyl groups (the two methyl groups on the same side as the anhydride ring).\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (C7). This moves the anhydride protons (H_A) far away from the methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectra:** A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of through-bond coupling.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present** in the spectrum of the major product but **absent or weak** in the minor product.\n    *   This observation is the key to identifying the interacting protons. The defining stereochemical difference between the *endo* and *exo* products is the distance between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product must be due to the spatial proximity of the anhydride protons (H_A) and the nearby methyl groups.\n\n7.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options:**\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_A):** These two protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They are located on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained bicyclic system, so a chemical shift around 3.5 ppm is expected. They should appear as a 2H singlet.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups, totaling 12 protons. In the *endo* product, they are not all equivalent. The two *syn* methyls are in a different chemical environment than the two *anti* methyls. This leads to two distinct 6H singlets. Typical shifts for methyl groups on a double bond are in the 1-2 ppm range. The options suggest ~1.0 ppm and ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product will connect the signal for the **2H anhydride protons** with the signal for the **6H *syn* methyl protons**.\n    *   Let's examine the choices:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Connects the two different methyl group signals.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Connects a bridge proton with the anhydride protons.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Connects one set of methyl groups with the anhydride protons.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Connects a methyl group with a bridge proton.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Option C is the only one that correctly identifies the interaction between the two equivalent anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and one of the sets of equivalent methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). This interaction is strong in the major *endo* isomer and weak or absent in the minor *exo* isomer, perfectly matching the experimental description.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile (the Anhydride)**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   This anhydride shows a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm is in the alkene region. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR shows one signal in the alkene region (137 ppm, C=C) and one in the carbonyl region (165 ppm, C=O). This means the two alkene carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   This high degree of symmetry, combined with the starting material being a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, points to **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride:\n            ```\n              O         O\n             //        \\\\\n            C           C\n            |           |\n            HC === CH   O\n            ```\n        *   It has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent (a singlet at ~7.0 ppm) and the two alkene carbons equivalent (~135 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (~165 ppm). This matches the provided spectral data perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n             C₅H₂\n            /    \\\n         C₄(Me) = C₃(Me)\n           |        |\n         C₁(Me) = C₂(Me)\n        ```\n    *   This is a cyclic diene and will participate in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically yield two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** product and the ***exo*** product.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product will be the *endo* isomer, formed through a transition state that maximizes secondary orbital overlap. This is the kinetic product. The *exo* isomer is typically the minor product.\n    *   Let's determine the spatial relationships in the *endo* and *exo* products. The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. It has a one-carbon bridge (the -CH₂- group from the diene) and a two-carbon bridge containing a double bond (the -C(Me)=C(Me)- part from the diene).\n    *   ***Endo* product (Major):** In the endo-adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the smaller CH₂ bridge. Consequently, the two protons from the maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_A**) point *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge protons (let's call them **H_B**). Therefore, **in the major product, H_A and H_B are close in space.**\n    *   ***Exo* product (Minor):** In the exo-adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. The anhydride protons (**H_A**) are therefore *anti* to the CH₂ bridge protons (**H_B**). **In the minor product, H_A and H_B are far apart.**\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our analysis in step 3, the pair of protons that are close in the major (*endo*) product and far in the minor (*exo*) product are **H_A** (the anhydride protons) and **H_B** (the methylene bridge protons).\n    *   Therefore, the observed NOESY cross-peak must be between the NMR signals for H_A and H_B.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals**\n    *   We need to match the proton types (H_A and H_B) to the signals described in the options. The major product possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **H_A (Anhydride protons):** These two protons are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They are attached to carbons adjacent to bridgehead carbons and carbonyl groups, so they will be deshielded. A chemical shift of ~3.5 ppm is reasonable. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, they will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **H_B (Methylene bridge protons):** These two protons are on a saturated carbon in a strained bicyclic system. A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is typical. Although they are on the same carbon, they are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C=C bond, one is *anti*) and thus not chemically equivalent. They will couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as a pair of doublets. A signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these two protons.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons (H_A) and the methylene bridge protons (H_B).\n    *   The signal for H_A is a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The signal for one of the H_B protons is a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: These are the two sets of methyl groups. They are not the pair of protons that uniquely defines the *endo* product vs. the *exo* product.\nB) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This corresponds to a methylene bridge proton (H_B) and the anhydride protons (H_A). Their proximity is characteristic of the major (*endo*) product. This is the correct answer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This would be an interaction between a vinyl methyl group and the anhydride protons (H_A). This interaction would be stronger in the minor (*exo*) product.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: This would be an interaction between a bridgehead methyl group and a methylene bridge proton. The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride\n\n1.  **Dicarboxylic Acid:** The problem states that a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene was dehydrated to its corresponding anhydride.\n2.  **Anhydride NMR Data:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at ~7 ppm. This chemical shift is typical for protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons). A single peak indicates that all the protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, while a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C). The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry, with all carbonyl carbons being equivalent and all alkene carbons being equivalent.\n3.  **Deduction:** The simplest molecule that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid, which has a *cis*-alkene. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as its two alkene carbons equivalent. Searches confirm the NMR data for maleic anhydride show a single proton resonance around 7 ppm and two carbon resonances around 136.5 ppm and 167.7 ppm.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The identified maleic anhydride (the dienophile) is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n3.  **Product Stoichiometry:** The molecular formula of maleic anhydride is C₄H₂O₃. The molecular formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is C₉H₁₄. The cycloaddition product would have a formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given in the problem.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is usually the major product due to kinetic control, while the *exo* product is the minor, more thermodynamically stable isomer.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the *endo* and *exo* Products\n\nThe reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring system with the anhydride fused to it. The key structural features are:\n*   Two **anhydride protons** on the fused five-membered ring.\n*   Two **vinylic methyl groups** on the double bond of the newly formed six-membered ring.\n*   Two **bridgehead methyl groups**.\n*   Two protons on the **methylene bridge** (the CH₂ group).\n\nThe spatial arrangement of these groups differs between the *endo* and *exo* isomers:\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the bicyclic system, placing its two protons in close proximity to the two *vinylic* methyl groups.\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned away from the bicyclic system, making its protons distant from the *vinylic* methyl groups but closer to the *bridgehead* methyl groups.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectra\n\n1.  **NOESY Principle:** 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å), irrespective of whether they are connected by chemical bonds.\n2.  **Differentiating Isomers:** A cross-peak that is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*) must correspond to a spatial proximity that exists only, or primarily, in the *endo* isomer.\n3.  **Prediction:** Based on the structures, a strong Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is expected between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons** in the *endo* isomer. This interaction would be absent in the *exo* isomer due to the large distance between these groups. Therefore, the cross-peak in question connects these specific proton resonances.\n\n### Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option\n\n1.  **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** These are protons on carbons attached to two carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift is expected to be relatively downfield, around **3.5 ppm**. As they are equivalent, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** Methyl groups attached to a C=C double bond typically resonate around **1.5-2.5 ppm**. Given the options, the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment for the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** Aliphatic methyl groups resonate further upfield, typically around **~1 ppm**. The 6H singlet at ~1 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:** The cross-peak observed in the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. Based on the assignments above, this corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n\n3.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (unclear assignment). Incorrect.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (unclear assignment) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). Incorrect.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). **This matches our deduction.**\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are far apart. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and its products using NMR spectroscopy data.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**:\n    *   **Dienophile**: The description of the anhydride (dehydrated dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene) perfectly matches maleic anhydride. It is symmetrical, so its two alkene protons are equivalent, giving a single ¹H NMR peak (~7 ppm). It has two types of carbons (two alkene C=C and two carbonyl C=O), giving two ¹³C NMR peaks (~137 ppm and ~165 ppm).\n    *   **Diene**: This is explicitly given as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**:\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are tucked under the newly formed ring, is typically the major product due to kinetic favorability (secondary orbital overlap).\n    *   The *exo* product is typically the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Signals**:\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core structure. Let's identify the protons and assign the signals given in the options:\n        *   **Methine Protons (from anhydride)**: These are the two protons on the carbons that were part of the dienophile's double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent. They are in a bicyclic environment and adjacent to carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift would be around 3-4 ppm. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` is the best match.\n        *   **Bridge Protons**: These two protons are on the CH₂ group (C7) that bridges the bicyclic system. They are not equivalent (diastereotopic). One is *syn* (on the same side as the double bond) and one is *anti* (on the opposite side). They would appear as two separate signals, likely coupled to each other (geminal coupling), resulting in doublets. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n        *   **Methyl Protons**: There are two types of methyl groups. Two are attached to the double bond (~1.7 ppm) and two are at the bridgehead carbons (~1.0 ppm). The `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` and `6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm` correspond to these sets of methyl groups.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data**:\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride part is tucked under the ring. This brings the **methine protons** (from the anhydride, ~3.5 ppm) very close to the ***syn*-bridge proton** (on the C7 bridge, ~1.5 ppm).\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride part is pointing away from the ring. The methine protons are now far from the bridge protons.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak unique to the major product will be between the **methine protons** and the ***syn*-bridge proton**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The cross-peak connects the signal for the methine protons (`2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`) with the signal for one of the bridge protons (`1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`).\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical reaction and NMR data to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and options\n    problem_description = \"\"\"\n    A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride (maleic anhydride).\n    This anhydride was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    This reaction yields a major (endo) and minor (exo) product.\n    A NOESY cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product.\n    The task is to identify which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\",\n        \"B\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\",\n        \"C\": \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\",\n        \"D\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Assign signals to protons in the product structure\n    # The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    ProtonAssignment = collections.namedtuple('ProtonAssignment', ['signal_description', 'proton_identity'])\n    assignments = [\n        ProtonAssignment(\"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\", \"Methine protons from the anhydride part\"),\n        ProtonAssignment(\"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", \"One of the C7 bridge protons\"),\n        ProtonAssignment(\"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\", \"Methyl groups on the C=C double bond\"),\n        ProtonAssignment(\"6H singlet at ~1 ppm\", \"Methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons\")\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry and NOESY data\n    analysis = \"\"\"\n    1.

This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of 7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. The singlet nature for two protons suggests a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks. The peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride. The peak at 137 ppm is in the alkene region. The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest structure fitting this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent alkene protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O carbons and two C=C carbons), matching the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: The diene.**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at positions 1-4, a methyl group on each of these four carbons, and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction type and the structure of the products.**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the dienophile is conserved. Since maleic anhydride is a *cis* dienophile, the anhydride ring will be fused in a *cis* manner to the newly formed six-membered ring.\n*   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The Alder Endo Rule predicts that for kinetic control (the usual condition for Diels-Alder), the **endo adduct is the major product**, and the **exo adduct is the minor product**.\n*   Let's check the molecular formula of the product.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products.**\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C=C double bond of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. In other words, the anhydride ring is on the same side (syn) as the C7 bridge, but more importantly for NOE, the two methine protons at the ring junction are pointing towards the C=C bond.\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C=C double bond. The methine protons at the ring junction are pointing away from the C=C bond.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the key difference in the NOESY spectra.**\n\n*   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's examine the proton environments in the product structure (which has C₂ symmetry):\n    1.  **Vinylic Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond are equivalent.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons are equivalent.\n    3.  **Anhydride Junction Protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm):** The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused are equivalent. Their high chemical shift is due to being alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n*   Now, let's consider the spatial proximities:\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride junction protons (3) are pointing towards the C=C bond and are therefore spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (1). This proximity will result in a clear NOE cross-peak.\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride junction protons (3) are pointing away from the C=C bond and are far from the vinylic methyl groups (1). The NOE interaction will be very weak or absent.\n\n**Step 5: Match the interacting protons with the given options.**\n\n*   The unique cross-peak in the major product connects the **anhydride junction protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n*   Let's evaluate the options:\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This exactly matches our analysis. It describes the interaction between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride junction protons.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The \"1H doublet\" signal is inconsistent with the C₂ symmetric structure of the product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent. Also, the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) are not close to the anhydride junction protons.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This describes an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. These groups are on opposite sides of the bicyclic system and are too far apart for a significant NOE.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: The Anhydride**\n    *   It is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. For a simple alkene, this means the two protons on the double bond are equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (characteristic of an alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, C=O). The presence of only two peaks implies high symmetry.\n    *   The simplest molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is derived from maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a C=C double bond. It has a plane of symmetry that makes the two alkene protons equivalent (¹H NMR peak at ~7.1 ppm) and also makes the two alkene carbons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent (two ¹³C NMR peaks at ~136 ppm and ~166 ppm). This perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: The Diene**\n    *   The problem explicitly names it as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds and four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the Alder-Woodward rule (or endo rule), the major product under kinetic control (which is usually the case unless the reaction is run at high temperatures for a long time) is the ***endo* adduct**. The ***exo* adduct** is the minor product.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This confirms the reaction stoichiometry.\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that bisects the methylene bridge (C7), the C2=C3 double bond, and the anhydride ring.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon methylene bridge (C7).\n\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon methylene bridge (C7).\n\n### **4. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectra and Analyze the NOESY Data**\n\nNOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY) shows correlations between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak is observed in the major product but not the minor product, meaning we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's identify the different types of protons and their approximate chemical shifts based on the common structure of the products:\n\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on saturated, quaternary carbons (C1, C4). **Signal: ~1.0 ppm, 6H singlet.**\n*   **Vinylic Methyls:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3). **Signal: ~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet.**\n*   **Anhydride Protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. **Signal: ~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet.**\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons:** Two diastereotopic protons at the C7 position. They couple to each other, forming a pair of doublets (an AX system). One proton is *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond and the other is *anti*. Due to the anisotropic effect of the double bond, their chemical shifts differ. A reasonable shift for one of these would be **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**.\n\nNow, let's analyze the spatial relationships for each option in the *endo* vs. *exo* isomers:\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**:\n    *   *Endo (Major)*: The anhydride protons are \"under\" the C=C bond, relatively far from the vinylic methyls. NOE would be weak or absent.\n    *   *Exo (Minor)*: The anhydride protons are on the same face as the vinylic methyls. They would be close, giving a strong NOE.\n    *   This is the opposite of the experimental observation.\n\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`)**:\n    *   The distance between the bridgehead methyls and the methylene bridge protons is fixed by the rigid bicyclic skeleton and is the same in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. A NOE, if present, would be seen in both spectra.\n\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`)**:\n    *   Similar to B, the distance between these two sets of methyl groups is the same in both isomers. A NOE would be present in both.\n\n*   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`)**:\n    *   ***Endo (Major)***: The anhydride ring and its protons are on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge. The anhydride protons are very close in space to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge. A strong NOE is expected.\n    *   ***Exo (Minor)***: The anhydride ring and its protons are on the opposite side of the C7 methylene bridge. They are far from the bridge protons. No NOE is expected.\n    *   This pattern perfectly matches the problem's description: a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product is due to the through-space interaction between the anhydride protons and one of the methylene bridge protons. This corresponds to the signals of a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm and 165 ppm).\n    *   A single ¹H NMR peak indicates that all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of alkene protons.\n    *   Maleic acid is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has two equivalent alkene protons, which explains the single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum. A typical chemical shift for these protons is around 7 ppm. The ¹³C NMR would show two peaks: one for the two equivalent alkene carbons (~135-137 ppm) and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~160-165 ppm). This perfectly matches the provided data.\n*   **Diene:** The dienophile, maleic anhydride, reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This diene has four methyl groups on the conjugated double bonds and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n*   The reaction between a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) and a cyclic dienophile (maleic anhydride) results in a bicyclic product. Specifically, it forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Two diastereomeric products, *endo* and *exo*, can be formed. Typically, the *endo* product is the major product because it is formed faster (kinetic control), while the *exo* product is more stable but forms more slowly (thermodynamic control). The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to the *endo* and *exo* adducts, respectively.\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Products and their NMR Spectra**\n\nLet's break down the structure of the resulting bicyclic adduct and predict its ¹H NMR signals:\n\n*   **Protons from the Anhydride (H_anhydride):** These are two methine (C-H) protons on the anhydride portion of the new bicyclic system. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring, typically resonating around 3.2-3.5 ppm. Since they have no adjacent proton neighbors, they appear as a **2H singlet**. This signal is described in options A and D as a \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\"\n*   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of methyl groups from the diene:\n    *   Two methyl groups on the newly formed double bond (Me_alkene). These 6 protons would appear as a singlet around 1.7 ppm.\n    *   Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead). These 6 protons would appear as a singlet at a more upfield position, around 1.0 ppm.\n*   **Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** These are the two protons from the CH₂ group of the original diene, which now form the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system. These two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments). One is *syn* (on the same side) to the C=C double bond, and the other is *anti* (on the opposite side).\n    *   They couple to each other, forming two separate signals, each a **doublet**. This is often called an AB quartet.\n    *   The *syn* proton is shielded by the π-electron cloud of the double bond and appears more upfield.\n    *   The *anti* proton is not shielded and appears more downfield. Its chemical shift is typically around 1.5 ppm.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The key difference between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products is the spatial arrangement of the anhydride ring.\n    *   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings the **H_anhydride protons** close to the **anti-proton of the C7 bridge (H_anti)**. Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented away from the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak will be absent or very weak.\n\n### **Step 5: Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the distinguishing cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the **H_anhydride** protons with the **H_anti** proton of the bridge.\n\n*   **H_anhydride Signal:** A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n*   **H_anti Signal:** A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\nThis combination precisely matches option A.\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This correctly identifies the correlation between the C7-bridge *anti*-proton and the *endo*-anhydride protons.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be a correlation between the two different sets of methyl groups, which is unlikely to be the primary distinguishing feature between *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This suggests a correlation between a bridgehead methyl group and a bridge proton. While possible, the H_anhydride-H_anti correlation is the classic and most definitive NOE for distinguishing these isomers.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This suggests a correlation between an alkene methyl group and the anhydride protons, which are spatially distant in the *endo* isomer.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the resonance for the *anti*-proton on the C7 bridge with the resonance for the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThe reaction described is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative and can result in two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Its high symmetry results in a single proton signal (~7 ppm) and two carbon signals (~137 ppm for the alkene carbons and ~165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons), which matches the problem description.\n    *   **Diene:** 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n    *   **Product:** The molecular formula of the adduct is C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n2.  **Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction typically favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions (Alder's Endo Rule).\n    *   However, when significant steric hindrance is present, the *exo* product, which is thermodynamically more stable, can become the major product. The diene used here has four methyl groups, two of which are at the reacting bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). These methyl groups create substantial steric repulsion in the more compact *endo* transition state.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Proton NMR Signals and Structure:**\n    *   The problem describes four key sets of protons in the products:\n        *   A 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm): These are the four methyl groups attached to the double bond (Me(alkene)). Their chemical shift is in the typical range for vinylic methyls.\n        *   A 6H singlet (~1 ppm): These are the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me(BH)). They are more shielded and thus appear at a higher field (lower ppm).\n        *   A 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm): These are the two equivalent protons on the succinic anhydride part of the molecule (H(anhydride)). They are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   A 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm): This corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). Bridge protons typically appear in this region, and the coupling arises from geminal interaction with the other bridge proton.\n\n4.  **NOESY Analysis:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5Å). We need to find a proton-proton interaction that exists in the major (*exo*) product but not in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   **In the major (*exo*) adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented *exo* (away from the C7 bridge). This places the anhydride protons (H(anhydride)) in an *endo* position, pointing \"under\" the main ring system and towards the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the *endo*-oriented H(anhydride) protons are very close in space to the *anti*-proton of the C7 bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak between these two groups is expected.\n    *   **In the minor (*endo*) adduct:** The anhydride ring is oriented *endo* (towards the C7 bridge). This places the anhydride protons (H(anhydride)) in an *exo* position, pointing away from the C7 bridge. The distance between the H(anhydride) and the bridge protons is large, so the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) and absent in the minor product (*endo*) connects the anhydride protons with one of the bridge protons.\n    *   Based on the chemical shifts provided in the options, this corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H(anhydride)) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H_bridge).\n\nTherefore, the two resonances connected by the differentiating cross-peak are the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high symmetry (two equivalent alkene protons, two equivalent alkene carbons, two equivalent carbonyl carbons) and the spectral data are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. In this molecule, the four carbons of the diene system (C1-C4) each bear a methyl group, and C5 is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   Since the dienophile can approach the diene from two different faces, two diastereomeric products are formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the **major product**, while the *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored and often the **minor product**.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Products and Proton Assignments:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core with the following substituents:\n        *   Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Being on saturated carbons, they will be upfield, around **~1 ppm**.\n        *   Two methyl groups on the double bond (C5 and C6). These are also equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Vinyl methyl groups are deshielded compared to alkyl methyls, so their shift will be around **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   Two protons on the fused anhydride ring (at C2 and C3). These protons are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and located on the rigid bicyclic system, placing their chemical shift downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   Two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. These are diastereotopic and will give rise to two separate signals, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled only to each other (geminal coupling), so they would appear as two doublets (or an AB quartet). The chemical shift for these is typically around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are coupled through bonds.\n    *   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C5=C6 double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the vinyl methyl groups (the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C5=C6 double bond. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is now much larger, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak will be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The specific NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major (*endo*) from the minor (*exo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n    *   Matching this with the given options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton).\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n        *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls).\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile (the Anhydride)**\n\n1.  The problem starts with a \"dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene\" which is dehydrated to an anhydride. This suggests a cyclic anhydride is formed from a starting material like maleic acid or a substituted maleic acid.\n2.  The spectral data for the anhydride is key:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Two peaks imply only two types of carbon atoms are present due to symmetry. 137 ppm is in the alkene (C=C) region, and 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride.\n3.  Let's evaluate potential structures:\n    *   **Maleic anhydride:** Formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). It's a cyclic five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and two C=O groups. It has two equivalent vinyl protons and possesses a plane of symmetry, resulting in one signal in the ¹H NMR. It also has two equivalent vinyl carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, giving two signals in the ¹³C NMR. The chemical shifts match the provided data perfectly.\n    *   **Substituted maleic anhydrides:** For example, citraconic anhydride (from methylmaleic acid) would have a methyl signal and a vinyl proton signal, not a single peak. Dimethylmaleic anhydride would have a methyl signal but no signal at 7 ppm.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The anhydride is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene and the Reaction Type**\n\n1.  The anhydride reacts with \"1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\".\n2.  The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n3.  Let's check the molecular formula balance:\n    *   Maleic anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n    *   Product: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n    *   Diene = Product - Anhydride = (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) - (C₄H₂O₃) = C₉H₁₄.\n4.  The formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (a C₅ ring with four CH₃ groups and a CH₂ group) is C₅H₂(CH₃)₄ = C₉H₁₄. This confirms the identity of the reactants.\n5.  The reaction between a conjugated diene (the cyclopentadiene derivative) and an alkene (the dienophile, maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct.\n6.  Diels-Alder reactions typically yield two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers. The *endo* product is usually the major kinetic product.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product and its Symmetry**\n\n1.  The Diels-Alder reaction occurs between the C1=C2-C3=C4 system of the diene and the C=C bond of the maleic anhydride. This forms a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative.\n2.  There's a contradiction: the named diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene, is chiral. A reaction between a chiral diene and an achiral dienophile would produce a chiral product, which would have an asymmetric ¹H NMR spectrum (e.g., four distinct methyl signals).\n3.  However, the options provided in the question strongly imply a high degree of symmetry in the product. For example, the presence of \"6H singlet\" signals means two methyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n4.  This implies that the product molecule must have a plane of symmetry. This can only happen if the diene that reacted was symmetric. It's a known issue that tetramethylcyclopentadiene isomers can interconvert, and the problem may contain a simplification or error in the diene's name. We must deduce the structure from the product's implied symmetry.\n5.  A symmetric product structure consistent with the reactants and reaction type would be a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene system with:\n    *   A C=C double bond at positions 2 and 3, each bearing a methyl group (**vinylic methyls**).\n    *   Bridgehead carbons at positions 1 and 4, each bearing a methyl group (**bridgehead methyls**).\n    *   A methylene (CH₂) bridge at position 7.\n    *   The anhydride ring fused at positions 5 and 6, with the two protons from maleic anhydride now attached here (**Ha**).\n6.  This structure possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. Due to this symmetry:\n    *   The two vinylic methyl groups are equivalent (one 6H signal).\n    *   The two bridgehead methyl groups are equivalent (one 6H signal).\n    *   The two anhydride-protons (Ha) are equivalent (one 2H signal).\n    *   The two protons on the C7 bridge are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic: one *syn* and one *anti* to the double bond).\n\n**Step 4: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n1.  Let's assign the signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the protons (Ha) on the anhydride moiety (C5/C6), deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups and the strained ring system.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This shift is typical for vinylic methyl groups. These are the methyls on the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This shift is typical for shielded alkyl methyl groups on a bicyclic frame. These are the bridgehead methyls.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This represents one of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n2.  NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product.\n    *   Major product = *endo* isomer.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* isomer.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n3.  Let's analyze the spatial proximities in the *endo* vs. *exo* isomers:\n    *   **Endo isomer:** The anhydride ring (with protons Ha) is tucked \"under\" the main bicyclic framework, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo isomer:** The anhydride ring points \"away\" from the framework, on the opposite side (*anti*) to the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  Consider the key distances:\n    *   **Ha ↔ Vinylic Methyls:** In the *endo* isomer, the Ha protons are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. In the *exo* isomer, they are far apart. **This is a potential distinguishing NOE.**\n    *   **Ha ↔ C7 bridge protons:** In the *endo* isomer, the Ha protons are close to the *syn*-C7 proton. In the *exo* isomer, they are far from both C7 protons. **This is also a potential distinguishing NOE.**\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls ↔ other protons:** The distances from the bridgehead methyls to most other protons are similar in both isomers. These NOEs would not be distinguishing.\n\n5.  We are left with two possibilities for the distinguishing cross-peak:\n    *   Between Ha (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm) and the Vinylic Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   Between Ha (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm) and a C7 proton (1H doublet, ~1.5 ppm).\n\n6.  Matching these possibilities with the options:\n    *   Option A matches the Ha ↔ Vinylic Methyls interaction.\n    *   Option B matches the Ha ↔ C7 proton interaction.\n\n7.  To choose between A and B: The NOE effect that distinguishes the *endo* isomer is a direct consequence of the secondary orbital interactions that stabilize its transition state, which involves the dienophile's activating groups (the anhydride) and the diene's π-system. This points to the proximity between the anhydride part and the newly forming double bond part of the structure. The NOE between the anhydride protons (Ha) and the vinylic methyls is a direct reporter of this proximity. Furthermore, an interaction between a 2H group and a 6H group is likely to be a very prominent and defining feature of the NOESY spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and the 6H singlet of the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR (one for the vinylic carbons, one for the carbonyl carbons). This information points unambiguously to **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   ¹H NMR: The two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's C₂v symmetry, resulting in a single peak. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a double bond conjugated to two carbonyl groups.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: The two vinylic carbons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, leading to just two signals.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes typically form bicyclic products and can result in two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which corresponds to these two isomers.\n\n3.  **Predict the Major and Minor Products (Stereoselectivity):**\n    *   The \"endo rule\" for Diels-Alder reactions predicts that the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile will be oriented \"under\" the newly forming ring system in the transition state, leading to the *endo* product as the major kinetic product. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this specific case, the diene has methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. In an *endo* approach, these methyl groups would sterically clash with the incoming maleic anhydride. In an *exo* approach, the anhydride approaches from the opposite side, avoiding this clash.\n    *   Therefore, due to severe steric hindrance, the *exo* pathway is favored. The **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. This is a well-known exception to the endo rule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NOESY Data:**\n    *   The NOESY technique in NMR spectroscopy reveals protons that are close in space (through-space interaction), regardless of their bonding connectivity. A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially near each other (< ~5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or very weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major product) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor product).\n\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This brings the protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) very close to the protons of the C7 bridge (H_bridge).\n\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) to the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the H_anhydride protons are far from the H_bridge protons. Instead, they are relatively close to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n    *   Conclusion: The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product must be the one connecting **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n\n5.  **Assign the NMR Signals from the Options:**\n    *   We need to assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These are two equivalent protons (due to a plane of symmetry in the product) on carbons attached to carbonyl groups. They are methine protons (CH) in a bicyclic system. They will be a **2H singlet** and should appear at a relatively downfield (deshielded) position. The value **~3.5 ppm** is a very reasonable chemical shift for these protons.\n    *   **H_bridge:** These are the two protons on the C7-CH₂ group. They are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments) and will have different chemical shifts. They are coupled to each other (geminal coupling), so each should appear as a **doublet** (assuming no other significant long-range couplings). A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm** is typical for protons on a saturated bicyclic bridge. The option refers to a **1H doublet**, which correctly describes the signal for one of these two protons.\n    *   **Methyl groups:** There are two types of methyl groups: two on the vinylic carbons (C2, C3) and two on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). We would expect two 6H singlets, one around ~1.7 ppm (vinylic) and one around ~1.0 ppm (alkyl/bridgehead).\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis to the Given Options:**\n    *   We are looking for a cross-peak connecting H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and one of the H_bridge protons (~1.5 ppm, 1H doublet).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This perfectly matches our deduction. It describes the NOE between a C7 bridge proton and the anhydride protons, which is characteristic of the major *exo* product.\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This would be an NOE between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which are far apart in the *exo* structure.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This is an NOE between the two different types of methyl groups. This is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique distinguishing feature.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This is an NOE between the bridgehead methyls and a C7 bridge proton. This proximity exists in both isomers and is not the unique distinguishing feature.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that describes the unique spatial proximity in the major (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile (Anhydride):** The starting material is a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid that forms an anhydride upon dehydration. The resulting anhydride exhibits high symmetry, as indicated by its NMR spectra:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at 7 ppm. The downfield shift is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond). A single peak means these protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Only two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This means all alkene carbons are equivalent, and all carbonyl carbons are equivalent.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is a five-membered ring formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). The molecule's symmetry makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two pairs of carbons equivalent.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition (a Diels-Alder reaction) between the diene and the dienophile. This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   When a cyclic diene reacts, two stereoisomeric products can form: an *endo* product and an *exo* product.\n*   The **Alder Endo Rule** predicts that the major product, formed under kinetic control, will be the ***endo* adduct**. The minor product will be the thermodynamically more stable ***exo* adduct**.\n*   The problem confirms this by stating that a major and a minor product are formed.\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of the Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   We must determine the spatial arrangement of the protons in both the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products to understand the NOESY spectrum.\n*   Let's label the protons from the maleic anhydride part of the molecule as **H_A**. These are the protons responsible for the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** in the product's spectrum (they are deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups). The protons on the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclic system correspond to signals around **1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same face) to the longer bridge of the bicyclic system (the C5=C6 double bond bridge). This geometry forces the two **H_A** protons into the ***exo*** position. In this *exo* position, the H_A protons are pointing towards the C7 methylene bridge. This results in a short spatial distance between the H_A protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite face) to the C5=C6 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_A** protons into the ***endo*** position. In this *endo* position, the H_A protons point away from the C7 bridge and towards the C5=C6 double bond. The spatial distance between the H_A protons and the C7 bridge protons is now large.\n\n**4. Interpretation of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A NOESY spectrum shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**.\n*   From our structural analysis, we concluded that the short distance between the **H_A protons (~3.5 ppm)** and the **C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm)** exists *only* in the major (*endo*) product. In the minor (*exo*) product, these protons are far apart.\n*   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that appears for the major product but not the minor is the one that connects the resonances for the H_A protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe resonances connected by this distinguishing cross-peak are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (from the H_A protons) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (from a C7 bridge proton). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Dienophile Formation:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is provided: ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** This anhydride (the dienophile) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) to form two products (major and minor).\n    *   **Product Information:** Both products have the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃.\n    *   **Spectroscopy:** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows a key difference: a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product.\n    *   **Question:** Identify the two resonances connected by this cross-peak in the major product, given a list of signals and their integrals.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Identify the Dienophile**\n    *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid that dehydrates to an anhydride is maleic acid. The resulting anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data against the structure of maleic anhydride:\n        *   **Structure:** It's a five-membered ring with two carbonyls and a C=C double bond. It has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** The two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They are deshielded by the double bond and the adjacent carbonyl groups. A single peak around 7 ppm is expected. This matches the data.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent alkene carbons (C=C). This means two signals are expected. Carbonyl carbons typically appear around 160-180 ppm, and alkene carbons around 100-150 ppm. The given signals (165 ppm and 137 ppm) perfectly match this expectation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The dienophile is maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder, which is a cycloaddition. We can determine the molecular formula of the diene by subtracting the dienophile's formula from the product's formula.\n    *   Product: C₁₃H₁₆O₃\n    *   Dienophile: - C₄H₂O₃\n    *   Diene: = C₉H₁₄O₀ -> **C₉H₁₄**\n    *   The Python code query confirmed this calculation.\n    *   The diene is named \"1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\". However, the product NMR data suggests a highly symmetrical structure (two different 6H singlets). For the product to be symmetrical, the starting diene must also be symmetrical.\n    *   A standard 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is not symmetrical. A more plausible and symmetrical isomer that fits the C₉H₁₄ formula is **2,3,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This diene possesses a plane of symmetry. Let's assume this is the actual diene used, as it's the only one that logically leads to the product's simple NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Products and Assign NMR Signals**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between the symmetrical diene (2,3,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and symmetrical maleic anhydride will produce a symmetrical bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** adduct and the ***exo*** adduct. According to the \"endo rule,\" the *endo* product is usually the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   Let's analyze the protons in the symmetrical product structure:\n        *   **Bridge Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the C7 bridge (originating from C5 of the diene) are equivalent due to symmetry. They are on a saturated, strained bridge and are expected to be shielded (low ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinyl Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond of the newly formed six-membered ring (originating from C2 and C3 of the diene) are also equivalent. They are vinylic and less shielded. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons that came from the maleic anhydride are equivalent. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and on the bicyclic framework, making them deshielded. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Cross-Peak**\n    *   The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is a through-space interaction. A cross-peak in a NOESY spectrum connects protons that are physically close to each other (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The presence of a cross-peak in the major product but not the minor one is the key to identifying the stereochemistry and answering the question.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the cyclohexene ring system. This geometry places the anhydride protons (2H at ~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the vinyl methyl groups (6H at ~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between these two sets of protons is expected.\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the double bond. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl groups is large. Therefore, no significant NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n    *   This observation confirms that the major product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The cross-peak observed in the spectrum of the major product must connect the two resonances that are brought into close spatial proximity in the *endo* configuration. These are:\n    *   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (from the vinyl methyl groups).\n    *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (from the anhydride protons).\n    This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere's a breakdown of the chemical problem to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Anhydride:** The dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) perfectly matches that of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent alkene protons give a single peak, and the two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons) give two peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system. Methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group is at carbon 5.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic product.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: an *endo* product and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically formed faster and is therefore the major (kinetic) product. In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the bridge containing the newly formed double bond.\n    *   The *exo* product is typically more stable but forms slower, making it the minor (thermodynamic) product. Here, the anhydride ring points away from the bridge.\n    *   The problem states a major and minor product are formed, which corresponds to the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Product Structure and NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **Structure:** The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Both the *endo* and *exo* products have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **¹H NMR Signals:**\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (H-A):** The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused (carbons 2 and 3) are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They are described as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. The lack of splitting is common in such bicyclic systems.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (H-Me):** The four methyl groups are in two different chemical environments. The methyl groups at the bridgehead (carbons 1 and 4) are equivalent to each other, and the methyl groups on the double bond (carbons 5 and 6) are equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct **6H singlets**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (H-B):** The methylene bridge (carbon 7) has two protons that are not equivalent and would likely appear as doublets. The problem mentions a \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\", which corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The key structural difference between the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products is the spatial relationship between the anhydride protons (H-A) and the methyl groups.\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond bridge. This brings the anhydride protons (H-A, at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the *syn* methyl groups on the double bond (one of the 6H singlets).\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride ring points away, making the distance between the anhydride protons and all methyl groups much larger.\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor one. This specific cross-peak must be due to the proximity of protons unique to the *endo* geometry.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the anhydride protons (the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and one set of methyl protons (a 6H singlet).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the differentiating NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product is between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 6H singlet from the nearby methyl groups.\n    *   Option A matches this prediction perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid Anhydride:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid was dehydrated to form an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the alkene region.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n    *   This data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃). Due to its C₂v symmetry, it has only one type of proton and two types of carbons, matching the spectral data.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring where the four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) are replaced by methyl groups. The C5 position remains a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n### **Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. It can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo product is typically the major product** due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the transition state.\n    *   The **exo product is the minor product**.\n\n### **Step 3: Structure and ¹H NMR Signal Assignment of the Products**\n\nLet's analyze the expected proton signals for the product:\n*   **Vinylic Methyls (6H):** The double bond in the product is between the original C2 and C3 of the diene. The two methyl groups on these carbons become vinylic. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry and should appear as a 6H singlet around 1.7–2.0 ppm.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls (6H):** The methyl groups on the original C1 and C4 of the diene are now on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent and should appear as a 6H singlet at a higher field, around 1.0–1.5 ppm.\n*   **Anhydride Protons (2H):** The two protons on the carbons from the maleic anhydride (let's call them H-anhydride) are equivalent. They should appear as a 2H singlet, likely deshielded by the anhydride group, around 3.5 ppm.\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons (2H):** The two protons of the CH₂ group (C7 bridge) are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are expected to be non-equivalent and appear as two separate signals, likely doublets due to coupling with each other. A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is reasonable for one of these protons.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Spectra to Distinguish *Endo* and *Exo* Products**\n\nNOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons. The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor one.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the **H-anhydride protons** (on C5/C6) are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are relatively close to the *syn* proton of the C7-CH₂ bridge and also relatively close to the bridgehead methyl groups. However, a defining feature often used to distinguish endo/exo isomers is the interaction between protons on the dienophile part and protons on the diene part. Specifically, in the *endo* adduct, the **H-anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This moves the H-anhydride protons away from the vinylic methyl groups, making their NOE interaction absent or very weak. Instead, in the exo-adduct, the H-anhydride protons become closer to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n### **Step 5: Correlate NOESY Data with the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a NOESY cross-peak present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This corresponds to an interaction unique or much stronger in the *endo* isomer. The key spatial proximity in the *endo* adduct that is lost in the *exo* adduct is between the anhydride protons and the substituents on the newly formed double bond.\n\nLet's re-examine the options based on our assignments:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Bridgehead Methyls**) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Vinylic Methyls**). These two sets of methyl groups are relatively far apart in both isomers.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Bridgehead Methyls**) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**C7 Bridge Proton**). This interaction might exist but is not the most distinctive difference between the isomers.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Vinylic Methyls**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**H-anhydride**). As determined above, the H-anhydride protons are close to the vinylic methyl groups in the major *endo* product, but far from them in the minor *exo* product. This matches the problem description perfectly.\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**C7 Bridge Proton**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**H-anhydride**). These protons would be closer in the *exo* adduct, which is the minor product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major product's spectrum and absent in the minor product's spectrum connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction sequence and the interpretation of NMR spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the products.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reactants\n\n1.  **The Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm, indicating two distinct types of carbon atoms.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**.\n    *   Let's check if the NMR data match maleic anhydride:\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride has two protons on the double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these protons are equivalent and appear as a single peak. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** The molecule has two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=C). This leads to two signals. The signal at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbons, and the signal at ~137 ppm corresponds to the vinylic carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is indeed maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **The Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene.\n\n### Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), which matches the information given.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo adduct** is typically the major product formed under kinetic control, which is common for Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   The **exo adduct** is the more stable thermodynamic product and is typically the minor product.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n\n*   A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (typically less than 5 Å apart).\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n\n### Step 4: Structural Analysis of the *Endo* and *Exo* Adducts\n\nLet's assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the product structure:\n*   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. They are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal, along with its coupling partner (not explicitly described as a distinct option), corresponds to the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge. Let's call them **H_bridge**.\n\nNow, let's examine the 3D structures:\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the C=C bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons (at ~3.5 ppm) point towards the CH₂ bridge. This brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the CH₂ bridge (one of the protons resonating around ~1.5 ppm).\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons point toward the C=C double bond, bringing them close to the **Me_vinyl** groups (at ~1.7 ppm). They are far from the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cross-peak that is unique to the **major (*endo*) product** must be due to the spatial proximity between the **H_anhydride** protons and one of the **H_bridge** protons. Based on the provided chemical shifts, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\nThis matches option C. The interaction described in option D (between the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) would be expected in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n\nThe correct choice is therefore the one that describes the NOE correlation between the protons on the anhydride part of the molecule and the protons on the CH₂ bridge.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
