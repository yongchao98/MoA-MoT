The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone carbonyl group (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n    *   This reaction creates a new chiral center at the C3 position.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face. This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at the new chiral center (C3): (R) and (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the two products will be:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers. They have the same connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms. They are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is different), so they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three stereoisomers**: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with HPLC**\n\nThe combined product mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different structures and polarities and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I (compounds 1 and 2) are diastereomers. They will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II:\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **one peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all types of isomers that are not identical: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   All five compounds in the mixture are chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound 1 and 2 are diastereomers.\n    *   Compound 3 and 4 are enantiomers.\n    *   Compound 5 is a diastereomer of 3 and 4.\n    *   Compounds 1 & 2 are constitutional isomers of 3, 4, & 5.\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all these different species.\n*   Therefore, each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3.\n3.  **Products:** Since the original molecule is chiral, the hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different stereoisomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. For a molecule with two stereocenters, there are up to 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers. However, due to the symmetry of pentane-2,4-diol, the possibilities are:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are identical and represent a single achiral *meso* compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) along with the meso compound. Therefore, three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound from Reaction II)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated, eluting as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the racemic pair will elute as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak, resulting in **two peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct and have different polarities compared to the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so they will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment, which allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   The column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The column will separate the three stereoisomers from Reaction II. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks, and the meso compound will give a third distinct peak. This results in **three peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** I will determine the structure of the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and predict the products formed when it is reduced with LAH. This involves identifying any new chiral centers created and determining the stereochemical relationship between the products (e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers).\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** I will analyze the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4. I will determine the stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, identifying any enantiomeric pairs or meso compounds.\n3.  **Count the Products:** I will count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced from both reactions combined.\n4.  **Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column. This type of chromatography separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers but does not resolve enantiomers.\n5.  **Predict Chiral HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a chiral HPLC column. This technique can separate all different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n6.  **Select the Answer:** Finally, I will match the predicted number of peaks for both HPLC methods to the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and provides the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of two chemical reactions\n    and predicts the number of peaks observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\")\n    print(\"Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material is a ketone with an existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has an (S) configuration.\")\n    print(\"LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center at C3.\")\n    print(\"Because a new chiral center is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two products are diastereomers.\")\n    print(\"The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction I: 2 products (a pair of diastereomers).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\")\n    print(\"Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule.\")\n    print(\"NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, creating the product pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers (C2 and C4).\")\n    print(\"The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4S) is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction II: 3 products (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine products\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the products from both reactions.\")\n    print(\"The final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Normal-Phase HPLC results\n    print(\"Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\")\n    print(\"Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC separates compounds with different physical properties (like polarity).

This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule. It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, these enantiomers will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity). It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, we have a racemic mixture of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different polarity and elute separately, giving another **1 peak**. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (different molecular weight, different functional groups), so their peaks will not overlap.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The combined product mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). Since it's a single stereoisomer, it is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (`C=O`) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (`-CH(OH)-`).\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction produces a mixture of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central `CH2` group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH₄ is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This product has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH₄) are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze them:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 4R) isomer). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains 5 total stereoisomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. Since they have different physical properties, they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives another peak.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times. Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other two products. It will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, there will be no overlap between the peaks from Reaction I and Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of the two reactions and the resulting HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S)-configuration at C5), the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the newly formed C3 alcohol center.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols. Since it is in excess, it will reduce both ketone groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This leads to the formation of three possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated as a distinct **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all five compounds, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (only the S-isomer), the hydride can attack the carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, these are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### **Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.

It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, are physically identical in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate, second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will not overlap.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It will also separate diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral and does not have an enantiomer, so it will appear as a **single peak**.\n*   The total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule has a stereocenter at C5, the reduction can form two different stereoisomers depending on the direction of the hydride attack. These two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This results in three possible stereoisomers.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatogram Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The enantiomers themselves will not be separated and will elute as one peak. This results in **two peaks** from Reaction II.\n\nSince the products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols), it is highly unlikely they will have the same retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction.\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the five stereoisomers produced in the reactions is chemically unique and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, all five compounds will be resolved into separate peaks.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new chiral center (C3).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.

This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** Because the molecule is symmetric, we need to consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of this enantiomeric pair.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the CH₂ group), making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the separation on a normal-phase HPLC column.**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is **achiral**. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated** on a normal-phase column.

They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated and give a second peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will have different retention times. Thus, there will be no accidental overlap of peaks.\n*   **Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column.**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a **chiral stationary phase**.

The ketone group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting material already has a chiral center at C5, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two different stereochemical outcomes at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5, (S)-5-methoxy, is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R).\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are a pair of enantiomers.

(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties, including polarity.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to this pair and will have a different polarity, so it will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each group of products: 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all molecules that are not identical.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the diastereomers from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)- vs. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers from Reaction II: (2R, 4R)- vs. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The chiral column will also separate the meso compound from its diastereomers.\n    *   Since all five compounds in the mixture are structurally distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column is designed to resolve such differences, each compound will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total number of peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at carbon 3 (C3) is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations, (R) and (S), at the new chiral center (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.

(meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of both the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the number of peaks on a Normal-Phase HPLC Column**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Rule:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n*   **Analysis of the combined mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from the products of Reaction II, so they will all be separated from each other.\n    Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   **Rule:** Chiral HPLC can separate diastereomers and also resolve enantiomers into separate peaks.\n*   **Analysis of the combined mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.

This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other products, so it will elute as a distinct, single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:**\n    Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (2 + 1) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 (C3) to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the front face or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This creates a new stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The reduction results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The starting material is achiral, and the molecule is symmetric about C3. This leads to the formation of a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Products:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (which is (2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R) - they are the same achiral compound).\n*   **Relationship:** (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different physical properties, such as polarity. Therefore, it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-ol and (3S, 5S)-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)-diol and (2S, 4S)-diol) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so they are structurally very different and will be well-separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 peak (from Reaction II meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for differential interaction with chiral molecules. It can separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are structurally distinct (either as diastereomers or enantiomers), a chiral column is capable of separating all of them. The meso compound is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer that will have its own retention time, distinct from the chiral isomers.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in each reaction and how they would be observed in the different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers at C3 (R or S). Since the stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S), the products are:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (S at C5) and the other being different (R/S at C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric and achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible combinations of these stereocenters lead to three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting together as a single peak.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two products. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n\nAssuming the products of Reaction I do not co-elute with the products of Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption for different molecular structures), the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram will be 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be separated by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all separable compounds, which is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (S configuration at C5), the hydride attack on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso, from Reaction II)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, cannot be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, can be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, resulting in another, separate **peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 mono-ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different molecules with different polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Each unique stereoisomer will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will, therefore, be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound. This results in **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The chirality is at the C5 carbon, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new C3 stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Since the starting material and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them enantiomers. They are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe combined mixture is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate peak**.\n    *   This results in **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Overall:** The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with each stereoisomer, including enantiomers. This allows for the separation of all different stereoisomers in a mixture.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The final mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five stereoisomers can be separated, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at C5, and it is a pure enantiomer.\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n    CH3-CH-CH2-C-CH2-CH3\n        |\n        OCH3\n    (Stereocenter at C5)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the planar ketone group (C=O) at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   Attack from one face will produce the (3S) alcohol.\n    *   Attack from the other face will produce the (3R) alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the two products formed will have the configurations (3S, 5S) and (3R, 5S). These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5). They are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n      O       O\n     //      //\n    CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the two ketone groups creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and the reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's examine the structure of pentane-2,4-diol. It has a potential plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group. The (2R, 4S) isomer has such a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound (just flipped over). So, these configurations result in only one product.\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) and a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined products on a Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase.

They will be separated. **(2 peaks)**\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will be separated from them. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together. **(1 peak)**\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 1 (racemate from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined products on a Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral phase. It can also separate diastereomers and structurally different compounds. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Compound 1, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, is a single chiral compound. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compound 2, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, is its diastereomer and will have a different retention time. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compound 3, meso-pentane-2,4-diol, is achiral but is diastereomeric to the other diols and will have its own retention time. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5, the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair, will be separated by the chiral column. **(2 peaks)**\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon C5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to two possible stereoisomers. Since the starting material already possesses a stereocenter at C5 that is unaffected by the reaction, the two products formed will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomers are produced.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This pair of molecules are non-superimposable mirror images, making them enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) one.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are produced: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) pair from Reaction II, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, which have different physical properties, are separable.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will produce **two separate peaks**.\n    *   In Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the racemic mixture will produce one peak, and the meso compound will produce a second, separate peak, for a total of **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The two separable compounds from Reaction I and the two separable sets of compounds from Reaction II are all structurally different and will have unique retention times. Thus, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\nChiral HPLC is designed to separate enantiomers by using a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer. It can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   The five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into five separate peaks.\n    *   **Reaction I:** The two diastereomers ((3S, 5S) and (3R, 5S)) will be separated, resulting in **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) from each other, and the achiral meso compound will elute as its own distinct peak. This results in **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the resolved stereoisomers from both reactions, which is 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option stating 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to determine the number of distinct chemical compounds produced by two separate reactions and then figure out how many peaks these combined products will show on two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): normal-phase and chiral.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone. The \"(S)\" indicates it has a specific 3D arrangement at carbon number 5, making it a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will convert the ketone group (C=O) at carbon 3 into a secondary alcohol group (CH-OH).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original chiral center at carbon 5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged. The reduction of the ketone at carbon 3 creates a *new* chiral center. The hydride from LAH can attack the flat carbonyl group from two different faces (top or bottom). This lack of selectivity at the new center means two different stereoisomers will be formed.\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:** The products will have configurations at both carbon 3 and carbon 5. Since C5 is fixed as (S), the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This gives two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have more than one chiral center, and they are not mirror images of each other.\n    *   **Count:** Reaction I produces **2** stereoisomeric products.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule has two ketone groups and is **achiral** (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is also a reducing agent. \"Excess\" means it will reduce *both* ketone groups to secondary alcohol groups.\n    *   **Product Structure:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the two ketones creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4. Let's analyze the possible combinations of R/S configurations:\n        *   (2R, 4R)\n        *   (2S, 4S)\n        *   (2R, 4S)\n        *   (2S, 4R)\n    *   Now, let's check the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it an achiral, **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound, just flipped over.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction starts with an achiral molecule, so it must produce either achiral products or a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of enantiomers. Here, we get both. We get the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Count:** Reaction II produces **3** distinct stereoisomeric products: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n4.  **Combine the Products:**\n    *   From Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.\n    *   From Reaction II: 2 enantiomers + 1 meso compound.\n    *   Total unique compounds in the final mixture = 2 + 3 = **5 stereoisomers**.\n\n5.  **Analyze HPLC Separations:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, mainly polarity.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they **cannot be separated** by normal-phase HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** (and constitutional isomers) have different physical properties, so they **can be separated**.\n        *   Let's count the peaks:\n            1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will separate. That's **2 peaks**.\n            2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will *not* separate. That's **1 peak**.\n            3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the other products from Reaction II, so it will separate. That's **1 peak**.\n        *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with enantiomers.\n        *   It can separate **all stereoisomers**, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n        *   Therefore, the number of peaks will be equal to the total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n        *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Matching:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nNow I will write the Python code to formalize this step-by-step reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC for the combined products.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    # Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one (chiral ketone)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\n    # The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n    # This results in two products that are diastereomers of each other.\n    products_I = [\"(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\", \"(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\"]\n    num_products_I = len(products_I)\n    print(f\"Reaction I produces {num_products_I} products (diastereomers).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    # Starting material: Pentane-2,4-dione (achiral diketone)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of both ketones creates two new chiral centers (C2, C4).\n    # The possible stereoisomers are (2R,4R), (2S,4S), and a meso compound (2R,4S).\n    # (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers.\n    products_II = [\"(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\", \"(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\", \"meso-pentane-2,4-diol\"]\n    num_products_II = len(products_II)\n    print(f\"Reaction II produces {num_products_II} products (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound).\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine all products\n    all_products = products_I + products_II\n    total_unique_stereoisomers = len(all_products)\n    print(f\"\\nTotal unique stereoisomers in the combined mixture: {total_unique_stereoisomers}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate peaks in Chiral HPLC\n    # Chiral HPLC separates all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    chiral_hplc_peaks = total_unique_stereoisomers\n    print(f\"Chiral HPLC can separate all {total_unique_stereoisomers} stereoisomers.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of peaks in chiral HPLC is: {chiral_hplc_peaks}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC\n    # Normal-phase HPLC separates diastereomers but NOT enantiomers.\n    # Peaks from Reaction I: The two products are diastereomers, so they separate.

This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon 5. The ketone at carbon 3 is prochiral.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting molecule already has a chiral center at C5, the hydride attack on the carbonyl can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the existing chiral center can influence the reaction, these two diastereomers will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is symmetric, we must analyze the stereoisomers formed.\n    *   Possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). Thus, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers in total: the (2R,4R) enantiomer, the (2S,4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture with HPLC**\n\nWe have a total of five different stereoisomers in the mixture:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   The products of Reaction I are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C7 ether-alcohol vs. C5 diol), so they will be separated from each other.\n*   Within the products of Reaction II, the racemic pair ((2R,4R) + (2S,4S)) and the meso compound are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on a normal-phase column. The two enantiomers within the racemic pair will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. Thus, the products of Reaction II will give **2 peaks**.\n*   This problem can be interpreted in a way common for academic questions, where the complex Reaction I is treated as a distractor, and the question is focused on the classic outcome of Reaction II. If we only consider the products of Reaction II, we observe **2 peaks** in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n*   A chiral HPLC column is designed to interact differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   Following the interpretation that the question focuses on the products of Reaction II:\n    *   The two enantiomers, (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the other two and will elute as a third distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the products of Reaction II will show **3 peaks** on a chiral HPLC column.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the interpretation that the question is designed to test the analysis of the products from the classic reduction of a symmetric β-diketone (Reaction II), we find:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks (one for each of the two enantiomers and one for the meso compound).\n\nThis matches option A. If we were to consider all 5 products from both reactions assuming ideal separation, we would get 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in chiral HPLC (Option B). However, the structure of the provided options makes the \"distractor\" interpretation the most likely intended solution path.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  Identify all products and their stereochemical relationships (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso).\n2.  Understand the separation principles of normal-phase (achiral) HPLC: separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but not enantiomers.\n3.  Understand the separation principles of chiral HPLC: separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n4.  Recognize that in multiple-choice questions, sometimes a simpler or more classic part of the problem is the intended focus, and other information may be a distractor. The clean match between the analysis of Reaction II alone and Option A is a strong indicator of this intent.\n\nFinal Answer is determined by analyzing the products of Reaction II.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing one stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration. The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH, LiAlH4) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong, achiral reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either the front or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S). The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Two products are formed, which are diastereomers of each other.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    Since they are diastereomers, they are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). NaBH4 is an achiral reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohol groups.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the two prochiral ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC.**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Principle:** Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different physical properties (including polarity) and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated; they will co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will have different polarities and will resolve into **2 separate peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of a racemic pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute, giving **1 peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will have a different polarity, giving another **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have very different retention times.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from the enantiomeric pair in Rxn II) + 1 (from the meso compound in Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column can separate all stereochemically distinct molecules: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** We have a total of five unique stereoisomers in our mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of them, each compound will produce a distinct peak.\n*   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction I:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position. Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH) creates a new stereocenter. Because a new stereocenter is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two possible products are diastereomers. The starting (S) configuration at C5 remains unchanged, while the new alcohol at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two distinct diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. Treatment with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound, (2R, 4S). The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral and is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, containing the products from both reactions, consists of a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can distinguish between constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute as a **single peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different molecules and will have different retention times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC utilizes a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. The different stereoisomers interact differently with the CSP, leading to different retention times.\n\n*   Each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved by the chiral column.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (Peak 5)\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC will be **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone. It has one existing chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at carbon 3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using lithium aluminum hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new chiral center at carbon 3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl group are not equivalent. The hydride can attack from either face, leading to the formation of two different products. These products, (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n**Outcome of Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can result in three possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (which is a meso compound and identical to the 2S,4R form).\n*   The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses an achiral reagent, this pair is formed as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture). The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Outcome of Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a racemic mixture of two enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and polarities, so they will be separated.\n*   **Meso compounds** are diastereomers of chiral isomers and will also be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks from our mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer to the other products from Reaction II and will form a **separate peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules with different polarities and will not co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from the enantiomeric pair in Reaction II) + 1 (from the meso compound in Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   The column will interact differently with each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture, allowing for their separation.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be resolved.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from the other isomers.\n\nAssuming the chiral column is effective, it will resolve all five stereoisomers present in the final mixture.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting products to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3, which is a prochiral center, creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because one stereocenter (C5) is the same in both molecules, while the other stereocenter (C3) is different.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, which has two stereocenters (at C2 and C4). This reaction produces three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (this is a meso compound, as it has a plane of symmetry, and is identical to the (2S, 4R) form).\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. The meso isomer is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are indistinguishable in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties, so it will be separated, resulting in a **second peak** from Reaction II's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally different molecules and will not co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other:\n    *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the other two, will elute separately, giving a **third peak**.\n*   Again, it is assumed that none of the five distinct compounds accidentally co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone. It has one existing stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone functional group (C=O) at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between Products:** Since the products have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both ketones are fully reduced.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they form a **pair of enantiomers**.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the C3 methylene group). A molecule with stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products:** Reaction II produces three stereoisomers in total: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **3. Combine Products and Analyze with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, which are five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol    (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol    (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol        (from Rxn II)\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each type of HPLC.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Separates:** Constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Does NOT Separate:** Enantiomers, because they have identical physical properties (polarity, boiling point, etc.) in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Counting:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will be separated**, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II are the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute and appear as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n        *   So, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are constitutional isomers with significantly different polarities (diols are much more polar). They will be well-separated from each other.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n*   **Separates:** All different stereoisomers, including enantiomers, diastereomers, and meso compounds.\n*   **Peak Counting:**\n    *   The five products are all unique stereoisomers. The chiral column will interact differently with each one, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The parent chain is hexane. A ketone is at C-3, and a methoxy group is at C-5. The numbering starts from the end that gives the ketone the lowest number:\n        CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n        1   2   3     4    5        6\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at C-5, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH reduces the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C-5 is unaffected by the reaction. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either face, leading to both possible configurations (R and S) at the newly formed chiral center (C-3).\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Since the products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C-5) but opposite configurations at the other (C-3), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C-2 and C-4 creates two new chiral centers.\n    *   CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction is not stereoselective, so it will produce a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of these two enantiomers.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the central CH₂ group). A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound). The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture on HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol         (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol      (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol      (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will have different properties and will give a **separate peak**.\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together, giving a **single peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will certainly elute at different times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** We will have one peak for each of the following: (Compound 1), (Compound 2), (Compound 3), and (Compounds 4+5).\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The chiral column can distinguish between all different stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1) -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 3: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, but a diastereomer of all others) -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are an enantiomeric pair. The chiral column will separate them.\n        *   Compound 4: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n        *   Compound 5: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃`\n    *   Key feature: It possesses a single chiral center at Carbon-5 (C5) with a defined (S) configuration. This makes the entire molecule chiral.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a powerful reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The starting molecule is chiral, but the reagent (LAH) is achiral. The reduction of the prochiral carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces. This results in the formation of two products with different configurations at the newly formed C3 stereocenter.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement at one (but not all) of their stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct stereoisomeric products (diastereomers).\n\n#### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting compound is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    *   Key feature: This molecule is symmetric and **achiral**.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. Since the molecule is symmetric and two chiral centers are created, we must look for meso compounds and enantiomeric pairs.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral reactants, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomeric products: one meso compound and a racemic pair of two enantiomers.\n\n#### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions, for a total of **five** unique stereoisomers.\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will not be separated from each other and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair).\n    *   The products of Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (C₇ ether-alcohol vs. C₅ diol) and will not co-elute.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all stereoisomers (both enantiomers and diastereomers).\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all five of these compounds into distinct peaks (assuming ideal separation).\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   The chromatogram from the **chiral HPLC** will show **5 peaks**.\n*   The chromatogram from the **normal-phase HPLC** will show **4 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, provided as a single enantiomer. The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃, with the stereocenter at carbon 5 having the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the carbonyl group at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3. Since the starting material is chiral, the environment of the reaction is chiral. The hydride (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are generally formed in unequal amounts in such a reaction.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of two ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ will reduce both carbonyls to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. Since the starting material is achiral, the overall product mixture must be optically inactive.\n*   **Products:** Three stereoisomers are possible:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry (and is identical to the (2S, 4R) structure). This makes it an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of both the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds in total: two diastereomers from Reaction I and three stereoisomers (a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers) from Reaction II.\n\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   **Enantiomers**, like the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, such as the two products from Reaction I, have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **two peaks**.\n    *   The meso diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair from the same reaction. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives one peak for the meso compound and one peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair. This is **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so they will be well-separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** We sum the separable groups:\n    *   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 3: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n    *   Peak 4: (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (co-eluting enantiomers)\n\nThus, we observe **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:** A chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks:** We count each unique stereoisomer in the 5-component mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1 from Rxn I) -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2 from Rxn I) -> **1 peak**\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 1 from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 2 from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n\nSince all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and a chiral column can resolve both diastereomers and enantiomers, we expect to see **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC (assuming ideal separation with no accidental co-elution).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave during the chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to an alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure and a new stereocenter is formed, the two resulting products will be diastereomers: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Summary for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to alcohols by sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two stereocenters in the product, pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound.\n*   **Summary for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, the mixture contains a total of **five** different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer A)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer B)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer C)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer D)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso E)\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Diastereomers A and B have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   Enantiomers C and D are indistinguishable on an achiral column and will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   Meso compound E is a diastereomer of C and D, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **one peak**.\nThe products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally distinct molecules with different polarities and will be well separated from each other.\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Diastereomers A and B will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   Enantiomers C and D will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   Meso compound E, being a distinct achiral molecule, will produce **one peak**.\nAs a result, all five compounds in the mixture will be separated from one another.\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from the resolved enantiomers) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe user's question can be broken down by analyzing the products of each reaction and then determining how they will behave in two different types of liquid chromatography.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position in the S configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a powerful reducing agent. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, resulting in two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter (C3). Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S configuration), the products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can lead to three different stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images and are therefore a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined and analyzed.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. It is capable of separating diastereomers but cannot resolve enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of Products:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products consist of a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will behave as a single substance on an achiral column and elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers and will elute separately, giving a second peak. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 compounds) and will have different retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to differentiate between enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of Products:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) into **2 distinct peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated, yielding a third peak. This results in **3 peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Since the products of the two reactions are structurally distinct, they will all be resolved. The total number of peaks is the sum of all unique stereoisomers produced: 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction I:** The reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) targets the ketone functional group at the C-3 position. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C-3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. Since the original stereocenter at C-5 remains in the (S) configuration, the products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Reaction II:** The reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups at C-2 and C-4, creating two new stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are (2R,4R), (2S,4S), and (2R,4S). The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R,4S) isomer is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Thus, this reaction yields three distinct stereoisomers: the (2R,4R)-diol, the (2S,4S)-diol, and the meso-diol.\n\n### Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (from Reaction II)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Constitutional Isomers:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) have different molecular formulas and structures, so they will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers:** These have different physical properties, including polarity, and are separable by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will result in **two separate peaks**.\n    *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers, yielding **one peak for the meso compound** and **one peak for the enantiomeric pair**.\n*   **Enantiomers:** These have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a normal-phase column. The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) enantiomers from Reaction II will elute together as a single peak.\n\nCombining these points, the separable entities are: the two distinct diastereomers from Reaction I, the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, and the meso compound from Reaction II. This results in a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. It achieves this because the enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct from one another.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from Reaction II from each other.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is also chemically distinct and will be separated from all other isomers.\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all five stereoisomers, resulting in **5 peaks** in the chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to the conclusion that there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products of two separate reactions and then determining how those products will behave in two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products:** The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at the newly formed alcohol center (C3).\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Products 1A and 1B have one identical chiral center (5S) and one opposite chiral center (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (`CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`).\n    *   This molecule is achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the products must be either achiral or a racemic mixture of chiral molecules. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are **enantiomers**. The reaction produces them in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's predict the number of peaks for each HPLC type.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Constitutional isomers and diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is one distinct compound. (Peak 1)\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is a diastereomer of the above compound, so it will have different properties and will separate. (Peak 2)\n    3.  **Racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These are enantiomers and will co-elute as one peak. (Peak 3)\n    4.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) diols. It will have different properties and will separate from their peak. (Peak 4)\n*   Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral stationary phase can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all compounds that are not identical.\n*   It separates constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n*   Let's count the separable compounds:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (Peak 1)\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (diastereomer of 1, will separate) (Peak 2)\n    3.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** (Peak 3)\n    4.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (enantiomer of 3, will separate on a chiral column) (Peak 4)\n    5.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol** (diastereomer of 3 and 4, will separate) (Peak 5)\n*   All five stereoisomers are unique and will be resolved by a chiral column.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave in the different chromatography systems.\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This ketone has one existing chiral center at the C5 position with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers. Since the starting material already has a chiral center at C5 that is unaffected by the reaction, the two products will be diastereomers:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral β-diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of both ketones produces pentane-2,4-diol, which has two chiral centers at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R), which are identical due to a plane of symmetry)\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral and is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Product Analysis for HPLC\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, however, have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nAnalyzing the peaks for the combined mixture on a normal-phase column:\n1.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is one of the diastereomers from Reaction I.\n2.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is the second diastereomer from Reaction I and will have a different retention time from the first.\n3.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** This compound is a diastereomer of the other pentane-2,4-diol products and will be separated.\n4.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This pair of enantiomers will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n\nAssuming the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different enough to have unique retention times, we would observe a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n#### Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC\n\nA chiral stationary phase provides a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\nAnalyzing the peaks for the combined mixture on a chiral column:\n1.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n2.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n3.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n4.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n5.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol**\n\nEach of these five compounds will be resolved, resulting in **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of HPLC peaks.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. The acidic workup protonates the intermediate.\n    *   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C5. However, the reduction of the planar ketone at C3 creates a *new* chiral center. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two stereoisomeric products (a pair of diastereomers) are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols. The acidic workup provides the protons.\n    *   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers (a racemic mixture will be formed).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze Combined Products on HPLC:**\n    *   We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in the final mixture:\n        *   From Reaction I (2 compounds): (3R, 5S)-alcohol, (3S, 5S)-alcohol.\n        *   From Reaction II (3 compounds): (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and the (2R, 4S)-meso-diol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and will *not* be separated; they elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Let's count the peaks:\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different polarities and will produce **2 separate peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has a different polarity, so it will produce its own, separate peak (**1 peak**). This gives 2 peaks from Reaction II's products.\n    *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, a chiral column can resolve all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n    *   Let's count the peaks:\n        *   The 2 diastereomers from Reaction I are distinct and will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n        *   The 3 stereoisomers from Reaction II (the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound) are all distinct from each other and will be resolved, giving **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Chiral HPLC Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC, which matches option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC experiments.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction I ---\n    # Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\n    # The starting material has one chiral center (C5, S-config).\n    # LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center.\n    # The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n    # This reaction produces two diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    products_rxn1_count = 2\n    products_rxn1_desc = \"Two diastereomers\"\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reaction II ---\n    # Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\n    # The starting material is achiral.\n    # NaBH4 reduces both ketones (at C2 and C4) to alcohols, creating two new chiral centers.\n    # This produces three stereoisomers:\n    # 1.

This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   The stereocenter at C5 is already defined.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration will be retained.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl. Since the molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the two faces are diastereotopic. This means the attack is not equally likely from both sides, but it will still produce a mixture of two products. These products will have different configurations at the newly formed stereocenter (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** A mixture of two diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both groups are reduced. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Since the starting material is achiral, we need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   Possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's examine the (2R, 4S) structure. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable), so there is only one meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers.\n    *   Product 2A: A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Product 2B: The meso compound, (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the HPLC Chromatograms**\nThe products from both reactions are combined. The final mixture contains five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II.** The products from Reaction I are C₇ alcohols with an ether group (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols), while the products from Reaction II are C₅ diols (pentane-2,4-diols). These are structurally very different and will have different retention times on any HPLC column. Thus, no peak from Reaction I will overlap with a peak from Reaction II.\n\n*   **Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. This will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   Total from Reaction II: 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers).\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are different compounds and will be separated. This will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be separated by the chiral column. This will give **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is a distinct stereoisomer and will elute separately from the two enantiomers. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   Total from Reaction II: 2 + 1 = **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The \"hexan-3-one\" part tells us it's a 6-carbon chain with a ketone (C=O) at carbon 3.\n    *   The \"5-methoxy\" part indicates a methoxy group (-OCH3) on carbon 5.\n    *   The \"(S)\" designation indicates that the stereocenter at carbon 5 has the S configuration.\n    *   The structure is: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3. This is a chiral molecule, and we start with a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH reduces ketones to alcohols. The carbonyl group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) from LAH (an achiral reagent) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of two stereocenters (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since they are formed from a chiral starting material by an achiral reagent, they will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** (it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group).\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" reagent ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso form.\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers** and are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a **meso compound**. It has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. It is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single, achiral molecule.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Combined Mixture Analysis with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of 5 different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow we analyze the separation of this mixture on the two types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable components:\n    *   Compounds **1** and **2** are diastereomers. They will be separated. -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compounds **3** and **4** are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together. -> **1 peak**.\n    *   Compound **5** (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It will be separated from their combined peak. -> **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (compounds 1 and 2) are structurally different from the products from Reaction II (compounds 3, 4, 5), so they will be separated from them.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase.\n*   It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   Let's count the separable components:\n    *   The mixture contains 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound **1** ((3R, 5S)-...)\n    *   Compound **2** ((3S, 5S)-...) - Diastereomer of 1, separated.\n    *   Compound **3** ((2R, 4R)-...)\n    *   Compound **4** ((2S, 4S)-...) - Enantiomer of 3, separated by the chiral column.\n    *   Compound **5** (meso) - Diastereomer of 3 and 4, separated.\n*   Assuming the column is effective, it will resolve all 5 distinct compounds.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at the C5 position. The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, creates a new stereocenter. This reaction results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers, meaning they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. Reduction with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) converts both ketone groups into hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This process creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are:\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (a meso compound)\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses an achiral reagent, this pair of enantiomers is produced as a racemic mixture (an equal mixture of both). The (2R, 4S) isomer is a meso compound, which is achiral and is a diastereomer of the other two isomers. In total, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\nThe combined products from both reactions are analyzed using two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different polarities and will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The product mixture contains a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable under these conditions and will elute together as a **single peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different retention time, appearing as a **separate peak**. This gives a total of **two peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption given their different molecular structures), the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\nTotal peaks = 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis method uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, yielding **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) from each other, resulting in **two distinct peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the others, will also be separated, eluting as a **third peak**. Therefore, the products of Reaction II will show **three peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all separated compounds.\nTotal peaks = 2 (from I) + 3 (from II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone. It is treated with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter.\n*   Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S) at C5) and the reducing agent (LAH) is achiral, the reaction produces a mixture of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one chiral center (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral dione. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups, followed by an acidic workup. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   Three stereoisomers are formed from this reaction:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\nIn total, five different compounds are produced from the two reactions.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined products from both reactions are analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, meaning it has different physical properties and will be separated, appearing as a distinct peak.\n    *   This will result in a total of **two peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The two diastereomers from Reaction I and the two groups of stereoisomers (the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound) from Reaction II are all structurally distinct molecules with different polarities. Therefore, they will all be separated from each other.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers in addition to other isomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, just as they were on the normal-phase column. This gives **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    *   The chiral column will now resolve the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will elute as its own **one peak**.\n    *   This results in a total of **three peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of unique compounds is five, and a chiral column has the ability to separate all of them.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and chromatographic separations:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a ketone and possesses a single chiral center at the C5 position with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is optically pure (only the S isomer is present), the hydride from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces. This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers, as one stereocenter is the same (5S) while the other is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral dione.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This can result in three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer).\n*   Therefore, this reaction produces a total of three distinct stereoisomers: the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, on the other hand, have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute and produce **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus producing a **separate peak**.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from enantiomeric pair) + 1 (from meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   **Enantiomers can be separated** by a chiral column.\n*   **Diastereomers**, being distinct compounds, will also be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The two enantiomers from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column and produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a distinct achiral molecule, will produce its own **separate peak**.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 (from Reaction II meso compound) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **5 peaks** in the chromatogram from the chiral HPLC and **4 peaks** in the chromatogram from the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-*CH(OCH3)-CH3 (the asterisk indicates the chiral center).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting material has one chiral center (C5), and a new one is formed at C3, the products will be diastereomers. The attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new C3 center. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** We need to determine the possible stereoisomers. With two chiral centers, there is a maximum of 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the substituents on C2 and C4 are identical), we must check for meso compounds. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The (2R, 4S) configuration is achiral because of a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound). The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and thus constitute a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reduction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the separation of the combined mixture on a normal-phase HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The combined mixture contains five compounds in total (two from Reaction I, three from Reaction II).\n    *   From Reaction I: We have two diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are generally separable by achiral chromatography. This would produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: We have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), are inseparable in an achiral environment and will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving another **1 peak**.\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II would produce a total of **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times. Thus, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n    *   **Textbook/Ideal Case:** Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n    *   **Practical/Simplified Case:** Often, diastereomers with very similar structures can be difficult to separate on a standard column. A common simplifying assumption in such problems is that only compounds with significant structural differences are resolved. The C7 ether-alcohols from Rxn I are structurally different from the C5 diols from Rxn II. Within each group, the diastereomers are very similar. Under this assumption, the two diastereomers from Rxn I would elute as one unresolved peak, and the diastereomeric products from Rxn II (racemic pair and meso form) would elute as another unresolved peak. This leads to **2 peaks**.\n    *   Looking at the options, both 4-peak and 2-peak scenarios for normal phase are presented. This suggests we need to consider the chiral separation to decide.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the separation of the combined mixture on a chiral HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   From Reaction I: The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S), will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: We have three stereoisomers.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will be separated by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral, but it is a diastereomer of the other two compounds and will have a different retention time from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II give a total of **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Textbook/Ideal Case:** Assuming the chiral column works perfectly and there are no accidental co-elutions, the total number of peaks would be the sum of all unique stereoisomers. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the analysis with the given options.**\n*   **Scenario 1 (Ideal \"Textbook\" Separation):** 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in chiral HPLC. This matches **Option B**.\n*   **Scenario 2 (Plausible \"Practical\" Limitations):** Let's re-evaluate based on the options. Option C suggests 2 normal-phase peaks and 4 chiral peaks.\n    *   **2 Normal-phase peaks:** This corresponds to the simplified case where diastereomers from the same reaction are not resolved, but the products from Rxn I are separated from the products of Rxn II. This is a plausible interpretation.\n    *   **4 Chiral peaks:** This implies that out of the 5 unique stereoisomers, two are co-eluting. A chiral column is designed to separate enantiomers, but it might fail for a specific pair. A more plausible scenario for a 4-peak outcome is the column successfully separates the enantiomers from Rxn II, but fails to resolve the diastereomers from Rxn I. Or vice versa. Let's assume the column resolves the diastereomers from Rxn I (2 peaks) and the meso diol from Rxn II (1 peak), but fails to resolve the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II (1 peak). Total = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 peaks. This is a consistent line of reasoning based on plausible instrumental limitations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are two main lines of reasoning:\n1.  The \"textbook\" approach assumes ideal separation for any compounds that are theoretically separable. This leads to 4 peaks (normal) and 5 peaks (chiral) -> **Option B**.\n2.  The \"practical\" approach assumes plausible limitations. A simple normal-phase column might only separate the two main classes of compounds (2 peaks). A chiral column might resolve most things but fail on one pair, for instance, the enantiomers from Reaction II, leading to 4 peaks. This logic leads to 4 chiral peaks and 2 normal peaks -> **Option C**.\n\nIn chemistry problems of this type, it is common to test the nuanced understanding of practical chromatography. The scenario where the normal-phase column gives poor resolution (separating only the two distinct families of products) and the chiral column resolves diastereomers but fails to resolve one enantiomeric pair is a consistent and plausible \"real-world\" scenario that leads directly to option C. The assumption that the normal-phase separation is not perfect (2 peaks) is quite reasonable. The assumption that a chiral column resolves diastereomers but might not resolve a specific enantiomeric pair (leading to 4 peaks) is also a reasonable consideration of practical limitations.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning for Option C is as follows:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC (2 peaks):** The two diastereomers from Reaction I are structurally similar and co-elute. The racemic and meso diols from Reaction II are also structurally similar and co-elute. However, the C7 ether-alcohols (Rxn I) are different enough from the C5 diols (Rxn II) to be separated from each other.\n*   **Chiral HPLC (4 peaks):** A chiral column can separate diastereomers. Let's assume the two diastereomers from Reaction I are separated (2 peaks). The meso diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and is also separated (1 peak). However, let's assume this specific chiral column is unable to resolve the enantiomeric pair of pentane-2,4-diol, so they co-elute (1 peak). Total peaks = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 peaks.\n\nThis provides a consistent explanation for Option C.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one pre-existing stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3. The hydride anion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter in common (S at C5) and one that is different (R vs. S at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, as it is used in excess. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   The pentane-2,4-diol molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through C3. If the configurations at C2 and C4 are opposite (one R, one S), the molecule is achiral due to this internal symmetry. This is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single meso compound.\n*   Thus, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: the (2R,4R)/(2S,4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the separation on a normal-phase HPLC column**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC, eluting as separate peaks.\n*   Let's count the peaks from the combined product mixture:\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different retention time. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** It is reasonable to assume that the products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally and chemically different enough to have distinct retention times and not co-elute by accident.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column**\n\n*   An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all distinct stereoisomers.\n*   Let's count the peaks from the combined product mixture, which contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. -> **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)). The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions, the total number of peaks will be the total number of unique stereoisomers present.\n*   Total number of peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis on the **normal-phase HPLC** predicts **4 peaks**.\n*   The analysis on the **chiral HPLC** predicts **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon C-5 with an (S) configuration. The ketone group at C-3 is prochiral, meaning the two faces of the carbonyl group are not equivalent.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is reduced by lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C-3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the *Re* face or the *Si* face, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers at the new center C-3: one with an (R) configuration and one with an (S) configuration. The original chiral center at C-5 is not part of the reaction and retains its (S) configuration.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since these two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C-5) and opposite configurations at the other (C-3), they are **diastereomers**.\n\nConclusion for Reaction I: **Two distinct compounds (a pair of diastereomers) are formed.**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomeric products.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses achiral reagents, this pair will be produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C-3 methylene group. It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the exact same meso molecule.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.

Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. Let's identify its structure and stereochemistry.\n    *   The IUPAC name indicates a 6-carbon chain (hexane) with a ketone group at position 3, a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   There is a chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. It remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion from LAH on the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces. This leads to the formation of two stereoisomers.\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   The two products have two stereocenters. One center is the same ((S) at C5) while the other is different ((R) vs (S) at C3).\n    *   Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is a symmetrical molecule and is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   For a molecule with two chiral centers, there is a maximum of 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   Now consider (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R). Because the molecule is symmetrical (the groups attached to C2 are the same as the groups attached to C4), the (2R, 4S) isomer possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. It is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces three stereoisomeric products: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    *   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II:\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will not be separated from each other and will elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties. It will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are constitutionally different molecules and will have different retention times. There will be no accidental overlap.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC Column**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column can separate enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   Let's count the number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a chiral molecule)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (a chiral molecule)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (an achiral molecule, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   All five of these compounds are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all five compounds.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to the option stating \"5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\".\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), an achiral reagent, creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack the carbonyl group from either face.\n*   **Products:** This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral dione.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Products:** Three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are formed:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them an enantiomeric pair.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound. It is a diastereomer of the other two isomers.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers, but it can separate diastereomers and structurally different molecules.\n\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The mixture contains an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. Enantiomers are not separated on an achiral column and will elute together as **one peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, appearing as a **second peak**.\n3.  **Combined Mixture:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be the sum of the separable groups: 2 peaks from Reaction I products + 2 peaks from Reaction II products = **4 peaks**.\n\n### Chiral HPLC\n\nA chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   The chiral column can distinguish between all five stereoisomers in the mixture because each one is structurally unique.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a diastereomer of the others, will also have a unique retention time and appear as a separate peak.\n\nSince all five stereoisomers are different, the chiral HPLC will resolve the mixture into **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that is enantiomerically pure, with a single stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is reduced using Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction converts the ketone group at C3 into a hydroxyl group, creating a new stereocenter at this position.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is chiral, the two faces of the planar ketone are not equivalent. The hydride can attack from either the front or the back, leading to the formation of two different products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography techniques.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), which will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reduction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can result in three different stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Products Analysis by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer A)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer B)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different properties, so it will be separated. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally distinct and will have different retention times.\nThus, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of these separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   The column will separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: **1 peak**\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: **1 peak**\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak**\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak**\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak** (as it is chemically different from the others).\nTherefore, a total of **5 peaks** will be observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe final analysis is as follows:\n\n### Reaction I Analysis\n*   **Reactant**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction converts the carbonyl group into a hydroxyl group, creating a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products**: The hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group is not stereospecific and can occur from either face. This leads to the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they differ at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n\n### Reaction II Analysis\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of both ketone groups using excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This reaction creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products**: The reduction results in three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they are formed as a 50:50 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is a meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n### Chromatogram Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the racemic pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will elute together as a **single peak** because enantiomers are not separated.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the racemic pair and will have a different retention time, resulting in a separate, **second peak** from Reaction II's products.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) have different molecular formulas and structures, they will elute at different times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   This will result in a total of **5 peaks** in the chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH₄) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral (at C5), the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the prochiral carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means the two faces of the carbonyl are not equivalent, and the hydride will attack preferentially from one side, but both possible products will be formed. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol. These two molecules are **diastereomers**. They will be produced in unequal amounts, but since the reaction goes to completion, both will be present in the final mixture.\n    *   Let's call them **Product A** and **Product B**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This is a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that there is enough reagent to reduce both ketone groups. The reaction goes to 100% completion.\n*   **Product Formation:** Both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and the reagent are achiral, the product mixture must be achiral overall (i.e., any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and meso-(2R, 4S).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are **enantiomers**. They are produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   Let's call them **Product C** and **Product D**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a **meso compound**. It is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry. It is a **diastereomer** of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n        *   Let's call this **Product E**.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds:\n*   From Rxn I: Product A and Product B (diastereomers).\n*   From Rxn II: Product C and Product D (enantiomers), and Product E (their diastereomer).\n*   Note: The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers (or more accurately, just different compounds) and will be easily separated by chromatography.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks on a Normal-Phase HPLC Column**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like C and D) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they will **not** be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like A and B; and like the pair (C+D) vs E) have different physical properties, including polarity. Therefore, they **will** be separated and elute as different peaks.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (or different compounds like the C7 products vs the C5 products) have different structures and polarities and **will** be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  Peak 1: Product A ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol)\n2.  Peak 2: Product B ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol) - Separated from A because they are diastereomers.\n3.  Peak 3: Product C + Product D ((R,R)/(S,S)-pentane-2,4-diol) - Co-elute because they are enantiomers.\n4.  Peak 4: Product E (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separated from (C+D) because they are diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, we expect to see **4 peaks** on the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It also separates molecules that are already separable on a normal-phase column (diastereomers and constitutional isomers). Essentially, a chiral column can separate all non-identical chemical species.\n\nLet's count the peaks for our five distinct compounds:\n1.  Peak 1: Product A ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol)\n2.  Peak 2: Product B ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol) - Separates from A (diastereomer).\n3.  Peak 3: Product C ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n4.  Peak 4: Product D ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separates from C because they are enantiomers and the column is chiral.\n5.  Peak 5: Product E (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separates from C and D (diastereomer).\n\nTherefore, we expect to see **5 peaks** on the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n### Analysis of Reactions and Products\n\n#### Reaction I\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone with the stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Because the starting material is chiral, the hydride attack on the carbonyl group is diastereoselective, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n**Products from Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.**\n\n#### Reaction II\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to alcohols, creating two new stereocenters in the product, pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture. The (2S, 4R) isomer has a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound.\n\n**Products from Reaction II: 3 stereoisomers (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).**\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined, resulting in a mixture of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\nA normal-phase HPLC column is an achiral stationary phase that separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Constitutional Isomers:** The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) have different chemical formulas and structures, so they will be separated from each other.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso compound ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will give one peak, and the unseparated pair of enantiomers will give another peak, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II, all these groups will be resolved.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. The CSP interacts differently with each stereoisomer, allowing for their separation.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is diastereomeric to all other compounds and will be separated.\n*   The pair of enantiomers from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks by the chiral column.\n*   Therefore, all five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** Determine the products formed from the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Pay close attention to the stereochemistry.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** Determine the products formed from the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione. Identify all stereoisomers (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds).\n3.  **Count Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on polarity. Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different polarities and will separate, but enantiomers have identical polarities in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak.\n4.  **Count Peaks in Chiral-Phase HPLC:** A chiral stationary phase can differentiate between enantiomers. Therefore, all unique stereoisomers will be resolved and appear as separate peaks.\n5.  **Match the Result:** Compare the calculated number of peaks to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n*   **Reaction I Products:**\n    *   The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It has one chiral center at the C5 position.\n    *   LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   Since LAH is an achiral reagent, it attacks the planar carbonyl group from both faces, producing both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 chiral center.\n    *   The original C5 stereocenter remains unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed: **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** and **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. These two molecules are **diastereomers**.\n\n*   **Reaction II Products:**\n    *   The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    *   Excess NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, creating two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)** and **(2S, 4S)** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)** has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration).\n    *   Therefore, three distinct stereoisomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC Analysis (Achiral):**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)) have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)) is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will separate, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols), so they will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral-Phase HPLC Analysis:**\n    *   A chiral column separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the total mixture, the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n    *   Total peaks in chiral-phase HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\n# The reactant (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is chiral.\n# The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\n# This results in two diastereomeric products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\nproducts_reaction1 = 2 # Diastereomers\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\n# The reactant pentane-2,4-dione is achiral.\n# The reduction creates two new chiral centers (C2 and C4).\n# This results in a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound ((2R, 4S)).\nenantiomers_reaction2 = 2\nmeso_compounds_reaction2 = 1\nproducts_reaction2 = enantiomers_reaction2 + meso_compounds_reaction2 # Total unique stereoisomers from Reaction II\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique compounds in the mixture.\ntotal_unique_compounds = products_reaction1 + products_reaction2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of peaks in Chiral-Phase HPLC.\n# A chiral column separates all unique stereoisomers.\nchiral_hplc_peaks = total_unique_compounds\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the number of peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC.\n# A normal (achiral) column separates diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but not enantiomers.\n# Peaks from Reaction I: The 2 products are diastereomers, so they separate.\npeaks_from_rxn1_normal = 2\n# Peaks from Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair co-elutes (1 peak), and the meso compound gives a separate peak.\npeaks_from_rxn2_normal = 1 + meso_compounds_reaction2\n# Total peaks are the sum, as products from Rxn I and II are structurally different and won't overlap.\nnormal_phase_hplc_peaks = peaks_from_rxn1_normal + peaks_from_rxn2_normal\n\n# Step 6: Present the results and determine the correct option.\nprint(f\"Number of products from Reaction I: {products_reaction1}\")\nprint(f\"Number of products from Reaction II: {products_reaction2}\")\nprint(f\"Total unique compounds in the mixture: {total_unique_compounds}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC: {normal_phase_hplc_peaks}\")\nprint(f\"Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: {chiral_hplc_peaks}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"The result is:\")\nprint(f\"{chiral_hplc_peaks} Peaks in chiral HPLC and {normal_phase_hplc_peaks} peaks in normal-phase HPLC\")\n\n# Match with options\n# A) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n# B) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n# C) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n# D) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\ncorrect_option = 'B'\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Number of products from Reaction I: 2\nNumber of products from Reaction II: 3\nTotal unique compounds in the mixture: 5\n--------------------\nNumber of peaks in normal-phase HPLC: 4\nNumber of peaks in chiral HPLC: 5\n--------------------\nThe result is:\n5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the prochiral carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter (C3). Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, the products will be a pair of diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The reaction produces a mixture of two diastereomeric alcohols.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of the two).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions. In total, we have **five** distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n*   **Structurally different compounds** (like those from Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different properties and will be separated.\n\nLet's group the products based on how they will behave:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II are the meso-diol and the racemic pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-diols. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Therefore, the meso compound will separate from the racemic pair. The two enantiomers in the racemic pair will co-elute. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   Let's count the number of unique stereoisomers in our mixture: five.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Peak 2 - diastereomer of 1, so it separates)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3 - achiral, but chemically different from all others, so it separates)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5 - enantiomer of 4, separates on a chiral column)\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct (even the meso compound is distinct from the chiral ones), a chiral HPLC column should resolve them all, assuming ideal conditions.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nAn organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed when the combined products are analyzed by normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. To solve this, we must first determine the products of each reaction and then apply the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5. The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   The chiral center is C5, and its configuration is fixed as (S). The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction converts the ketone group (C=O) at C3 into a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n\n*   **Product(s):** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, leading to two possible stereoisomers at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The starting material already has an (S) configuration at C5. Therefore, the reaction produces a mixture of two products:\n        1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n        2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have different configurations at one chiral center (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This converts both ketone groups into secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Product(s):** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, the mixture of products must be optically inactive overall.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a **meso compound**. It has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry in one of its conformations. It is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct compounds: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different retention times and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II are (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and the meso (2R, 4S)-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time.\n        *   Therefore, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks** (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂, ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂, diols) have different molecular formulas and structures. They are significantly different in polarity and will be well separated from each other.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   Since all five compounds in the mixture are structurally distinct stereoisomers (or constitutional isomers), they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and have unique retention times.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. As diastereomers, they are separated. **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and meso-(2R, 4S)-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are separated by the chiral column.\n        *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the other two, is also separated.\n        *   This gives **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different and will be separated.\n    *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n**Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The \"(S)\" designation indicates its specific stereoconfiguration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH, LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The incoming hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible stereoisomers for the newly formed alcohol group (R or S).\n    *   Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged ((S) configuration), the two products will be (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have one identical stereocenter (C5) and one different stereocenter (C3). Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is also a reducing agent capable of reducing ketones to alcohols. The problem specifies excess NaBH₄, ensuring both ketone groups are reduced. The reaction produces pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1 from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2 from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 1 from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 2 from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound from Rxn II)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate **diastereomers** because they have different physical properties, including polarity.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers** because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Analyzing the mixture:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate from each other, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, so it will appear as a separate, single peak (**1 peak**).\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak (**1 peak**).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different and have a different molecular weight than the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), ensuring they will all separate from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 1 (enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to separate enantiomers. It achieves this by creating a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently, leading to different retention times.\n*   It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Analyzing the mixture:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from all other compounds (**1 peak**).\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II, which co-eluted on the normal-phase column, will now be resolved into two separate peaks (**2 peaks**).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 2 (enantiomers from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and how they would appear in the different types of HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position (S-configuration).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. LAH is a powerful, nonselective hydride-transfer reagent.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from either face, two stereoisomers will be formed. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (5S) while the other is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, prochiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a milder reducing agent that effectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. It will reduce both ketone groups in pentane-2,4-dione.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. Three possible stereoisomers can be formed:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral and is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture in HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n\n*   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore co-elute (appear as a single peak).\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will separate, giving **one peak**.\n*   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will not separate from each other and will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers) are structurally distinct and have different polarities compared to the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so it is expected that they will all elute at different times.\n\nThus, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n\n*   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers from each other: diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **one peak**.\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give a separate **peak** (as it's a diastereomer to the first).\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give **one peak**.\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be resolved from its enantiomer, giving a separate **peak**.\n5.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is structurally different from the other isomers and will have its own distinct **peak**.\n\nTherefore, all five stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated, resulting in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nTo determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and the principles of the separation techniques is necessary.\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The attack of the hydride ion can occur from either face of the planar ketone, resulting in two possible stereoisomers. Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged, the products are diastereomers:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a *meso* compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R) due to an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, Reaction II yields three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S))\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers and are produced as a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the combined mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their polarity.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and can therefore be separated on a normal-phase column. This will result in **two peaks**.\n*   For the products of Reaction II, the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). As diastereomers, they have different polarities and will be separated, giving **two peaks**. The enantiomers within the pair, however, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules (C7H16O2 vs. C5H12O2) and will have sufficiently different polarities to be resolved from each other.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be the sum of the separable components: 2 peaks from Reaction I + 2 peaks from Reaction II = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to separate stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   The mixture contains five chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n*   A chiral column can resolve all of these isomers because each one will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the meso compound and the two enantiomers) will also be separated from each other.\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions, all five stereoisomers will be resolved.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis predicts **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which is given as the (S) configuration.\n    *   The ketone group is at C3.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. Its reduction will create a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The existing stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It now has two stereocenters, at C3 and C5. Since the starting material was purely (5S), the products will be a mixture of (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers. To determine their relationship, we compare one to the mirror image of the other. The mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R). Since the second product is (3S, 5S), they are not mirror images.\n    *   Therefore, the two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral. It has no stereocenters.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃), has two stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are mirror images of each other, but they are superimposable due to an internal plane of symmetry. They are the same achiral compound, known as a **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore **cannot** be separated. They elute together as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different compounds (different molecular weights, formulas, and functionalities) and will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated. The two enantiomers will elute together. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   Enantiomers **can** be separated.\n*   Diastereomers **can** be separated.\n*   Again, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other and also separate the meso compound from both enantiomers. This gives **3 peaks** (one for each unique stereoisomer).\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH(OCH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's number the carbon chain to identify the positions: C6-C5(OCH₃)-C4-C3(=O)-C2-C1.\n    *   There is a pre-existing chiral center at C5 with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center, meaning its reduction will create a new chiral center.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form the final alcohol product.\n*   **Product(s):** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the two possible products will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced. The acidic workup provides the protons for the final alcohol groups.\n*   **Product(s):** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** For a molecule with two chiral centers (n=2), the maximum number of stereoisomers is 2ⁿ = 4. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses achiral reagents, this pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's examine the (2R, 4S) structure. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group. A molecule with chiral centers and a plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. It is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Summary of Products from Reaction II:** Reaction II produces three stereoisomers:\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of Product 3)\n    *   Product 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of Products 3 and 4)\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   It **separates** constitutional isomers (different connectivity).\n    *   It **separates** diastereomers (different physical properties, including polarity).\n    *   It **does NOT separate** enantiomers (identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** The final mixture contains five compounds in total before separation. Let's see how they behave on a normal-phase column.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and will have different polarities. Thus, they will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers have identical polarity and will co-elute, appearing as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity. It will appear as a separate, **1 peak**.\n        *   In total, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Combining Both Reactions:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, none of the peaks from Reaction I will overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to separate stereoisomers.\n    *   It **separates** constitutional isomers.\n    *   It **separates** diastereomers.\n    *   It **separates** enantiomers (by forming transient diastereomeric complexes with the CSP).\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** A chiral column has the ability to resolve all five unique stereoisomers produced, assuming no accidental overlap (which is a standard assumption in such problems).\n    *   **Compound 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Compound 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer of 1, will separate)\n    *   **Compound 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Compound 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer of 3, will separate on a chiral column)\n    *   **Compound 5:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Diastereomer of 3 & 4, will separate)\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutional isomers and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five stereoisomers are unique and can be distinguished by a chiral column, we expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks are observed.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere's the thinking process to solve this problem, broken down step-by-step.\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single, pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5, which is locked in the (S) configuration.\n    *   Reagents: Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to an alcohol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction converts the planar C=O group at carbon 3 into a new chiral center with a -OH group.\n    *   The original chiral center at carbon 5 is unaffected by this reaction; it remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the C3 carbonyl can occur from two different faces, creating both possible configurations (R and S) at the new chiral center.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Reagents: Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Because the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. We analyze the possible configurations: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        *   **(2R, 4R)** and **(2S, 4S)** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)** has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the 2S, 4R configuration describes the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total mixture contains **five** unique stereoisomeric compounds. Let's analyze how they behave in the two different HPLC setups.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).

The stereocenter at C5 is not part of the reaction site and its configuration will remain (S).\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two molecules:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same (S), the other is different (R vs S)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. We can expect two distinct compounds to be formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n        *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n        *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   **Transformation:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced.\n    *   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We need to determine the possible stereoisomers.\n        *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n        *   Let's consider the (2R, 4S) structure. Because the molecule is symmetric around the central CH2 group, the (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (just flipped over).\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and the meso compound are diastereomers of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n    *   The final mixture contains all five stereoisomers produced: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n4.  **Analysis by Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral)**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will elute at a different time, giving a **second peak**.\n        *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from Reaction II products.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds with an ether and an alcohol) are structurally very different from the products from Reaction II (C5 compounds with two alcohols). Therefore, it is safe to assume there will be no accidental co-elution between the two sets of products.\n    *   Total number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Analysis by Chiral HPLC**\n    *   An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column will interact differently with each of these five distinct molecules. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be resolved. The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be resolved. The meso compound from Reaction II is a unique stereoisomer and will also have its own retention time, different from the others.\n    *   Therefore, we expect to see **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4.\n    *   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reactions and chromatographic analysis to determine the number of peaks.\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since there is a pre-existing stereocenter at C5, the hydride can attack the carbonyl from two different faces, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible products are (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) molecules are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R, 4S) compound has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral. Therefore, this reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Combined Products:**\nThe final mixture to be analyzed contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n**Analysis by HPLC:**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   The two products of Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) have identical polarities in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has a different polarity and will be separated, giving another **single peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally different with distinct polarities and will be separated from each other.\n*   In total, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **four peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase to separate chiral molecules, including both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I are both chiral and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other products from this reaction. It will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and elute as a **single, distinct peak**.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will separate all five stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   In total, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **five peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the products of each reaction and how they will behave in the different HPLC systems.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at the C5 position (S-configuration).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The incoming hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, leading to two possible stereoisomers at C3 (R or S). Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the products are diastereomers.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Result of Reaction I:** A mixture of two compounds that are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a standard reagent for reducing ketones to alcohols. Since it is used in excess, both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. There are three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (This is a *meso* compound, as it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral).\n*   **Result of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, which have different physical properties.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are **diastereomers**. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The **enantiomers** ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on a normal-phase column and will elute as a **single peak**.\n    *   The ***meso*** **compound** is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules with different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to separate enantiomers. It creates a chiral environment where enantiomers form temporary diastereomeric complexes with the CSP, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nAll five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct and will have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the others, will also elute as a distinct peak. Since all five compounds in the mixture are different stereoisomers, the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

They are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is different), so they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three stereoisomers**: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with HPLC**\n\nThe combined product mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different structures and polarities and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I (compounds 1 and 2) are diastereomers. They will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II:\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **one peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all types of isomers that are not identical: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   All five compounds in the mixture are chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound 1 and 2 are diastereomers.\n    *   Compound 3 and 4 are enantiomers.\n    *   Compound 5 is a diastereomer of 3 and 4.\n    *   Compounds 1 & 2 are constitutional isomers of 3, 4, & 5.\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all these different species.\n*   Therefore, each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3.\n3.  **Products:** Since the original molecule is chiral, the hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different stereoisomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. For a molecule with two stereocenters, there are up to 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers. However, due to the symmetry of pentane-2,4-diol, the possibilities are:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are identical and represent a single achiral *meso* compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) along with the meso compound. Therefore, three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound from Reaction II)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated, eluting as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the racemic pair will elute as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak, resulting in **two peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct and have different polarities compared to the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so they will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment, which allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   The column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The column will separate the three stereoisomers from Reaction II. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks, and the meso compound will give a third distinct peak. This results in **three peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** I will determine the structure of the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and predict the products formed when it is reduced with LAH. This involves identifying any new chiral centers created and determining the stereochemical relationship between the products (e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers).\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** I will analyze the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4. I will determine the stereoisomers of the product, pentane-2,4-diol, identifying any enantiomeric pairs or meso compounds.\n3.  **Count the Products:** I will count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced from both reactions combined.\n4.  **Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column. This type of chromatography separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers but does not resolve enantiomers.\n5.  **Predict Chiral HPLC Results:** I will determine the number of peaks expected on a chiral HPLC column. This technique can separate all different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n6.  **Select the Answer:** Finally, I will match the predicted number of peaks for both HPLC methods to the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and provides the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of two chemical reactions\n    and predicts the number of peaks observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step analysis of the problem:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\")\n    print(\"Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material is a ketone with an existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has an (S) configuration.\")\n    print(\"LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center at C3.\")\n    print(\"Because a new chiral center is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two products are diastereomers.\")\n    print(\"The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction I: 2 products (a pair of diastereomers).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\")\n    print(\"Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\")\n    print(\"The starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule.\")\n    print(\"NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, creating the product pentane-2,4-diol, which has two new chiral centers (C2 and C4).\")\n    print(\"The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\")\n    print(\"- (2R, 4S) is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction II: 3 products (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine products\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the products from both reactions.\")\n    print(\"The final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Normal-Phase HPLC results\n    print(\"Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\")\n    print(\"Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC separates compounds with different physical properties (like polarity).

This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule. It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, these enantiomers will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity). It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, we have a racemic mixture of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different polarity and elute separately, giving another **1 peak**. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (different molecular weight, different functional groups), so their peaks will not overlap.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Key Point:** It can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The combined product mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). Since it's a single stereoisomer, it is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (`C=O`) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (`-CH(OH)-`).\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction produces a mixture of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central `CH2` group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH₄ is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This product has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH₄) are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze them:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 4R) isomer). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains 5 total stereoisomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. Since they have different physical properties, they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives another peak.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times. Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other two products. It will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, there will be no overlap between the peaks from Reaction I and Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of the two reactions and the resulting HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S)-configuration at C5), the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the newly formed C3 alcohol center.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols. Since it is in excess, it will reduce both ketone groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This leads to the formation of three possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated as a distinct **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n*   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all five compounds, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (only the S-isomer), the hydride can attack the carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, these are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### **Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.

It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, are physically identical in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate, second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will not overlap.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It will also separate diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral and does not have an enantiomer, so it will appear as a **single peak**.\n*   The total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule has a stereocenter at C5, the reduction can form two different stereoisomers depending on the direction of the hydride attack. These two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This results in three possible stereoisomers.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatogram Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The enantiomers themselves will not be separated and will elute as one peak. This results in **two peaks** from Reaction II.\n\nSince the products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols), it is highly unlikely they will have the same retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction.\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the five stereoisomers produced in the reactions is chemically unique and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, all five compounds will be resolved into separate peaks.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new chiral center (C3).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.

This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** Because the molecule is symmetric, we need to consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of this enantiomeric pair.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the CH₂ group), making it a **meso compound**.

They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated and give a second peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will have different retention times. Thus, there will be no accidental overlap of peaks.\n*   **Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column.**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a **chiral stationary phase**.

The meso compound will also be separated from the enantiomers. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = 5 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The ketone group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting material already has a chiral center at C5, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two different stereochemical outcomes at C3.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5, (S)-5-methoxy, is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R).\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are a pair of enantiomers.

It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties, including polarity.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers.

The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to this pair and will have a different polarity, so it will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each group of products: 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.

Essentially, it can separate all molecules that are not identical.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the diastereomers from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)- vs. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers from Reaction II: (2R, 4R)- vs. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The chiral column will also separate the meso compound from its diastereomers.\n    *   Since all five compounds in the mixture are structurally distinct stereoisomers, and a chiral column is designed to resolve such differences, each compound will produce a separate peak.\n    *   Total number of peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at carbon 3 (C3) is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations, (R) and (S), at the new chiral center (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol } A pair of enantiomers\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol }\n    3.  (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of both the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the number of peaks on a Normal-Phase HPLC Column**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Rule:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n*   **Analysis of the combined mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from the products of Reaction II, so they will all be separated from each other.\n    Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   **Rule:** Chiral HPLC can separate diastereomers and also resolve enantiomers into separate peaks.\n*   **Analysis of the combined mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II will be fully separated.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other products, so it will elute as a distinct, single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:**\n    Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (2 + 1) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 (C3) to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the front face or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This creates a new stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The reduction results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The starting material is achiral, and the molecule is symmetric about C3. This leads to the formation of a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Products:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (which is (2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R) - they are the same achiral compound).\n*   **Relationship:** (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different physical properties, such as polarity. Therefore, it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-ol and (3S, 5S)-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)-diol and (2S, 4S)-diol) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so they are structurally very different and will be well-separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 peak (from Reaction II meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for differential interaction with chiral molecules. It can separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are structurally distinct (either as diastereomers or enantiomers), a chiral column is capable of separating all of them. The meso compound is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer that will have its own retention time, distinct from the chiral isomers.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in each reaction and how they would be observed in the different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers at C3 (R or S). Since the stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S), the products are:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (S at C5) and the other being different (R/S at C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric and achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible combinations of these stereocenters lead to three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting together as a single peak.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two products. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n\nAssuming the products of Reaction I do not co-elute with the products of Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption for different molecular structures), the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram will be 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be separated by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all separable compounds, which is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (S configuration at C5), the hydride attack on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso, from Reaction II)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, cannot be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, can be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, resulting in another, separate **peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 mono-ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different molecules with different polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Each unique stereoisomer will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will, therefore, be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound. This results in **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The chirality is at the C5 carbon, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products with either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new C3 stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Process:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Since the starting material and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them enantiomers. They are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe combined mixture is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus eluting as a **separate peak**.\n    *   This results in **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Overall:** The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with each stereoisomer, including enantiomers. This allows for the separation of all different stereoisomers in a mixture.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The final mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five stereoisomers can be separated, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at C5, and it is a pure enantiomer.\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n    CH3-CH-CH2-C-CH2-CH3\n        |\n        OCH3\n    (Stereocenter at C5)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the planar ketone group (C=O) at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   Attack from one face will produce the (3S) alcohol.\n    *   Attack from the other face will produce the (3R) alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the two products formed will have the configurations (3S, 5S) and (3R, 5S). These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5). They are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n      O       O\n     //      //\n    CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, producing pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the two ketone groups creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and the reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's examine the structure of pentane-2,4-diol. It has a potential plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group. The (2R, 4S) isomer has such a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound (just flipped over). So, these configurations result in only one product.\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) and a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined products on a Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different structures and it can separate diastereomers (which have different physical properties). However, it cannot separate enantiomers (which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n*   **Mixture Composition:** The total mixture contains 5 stereoisomers:\n    1.

This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral phase. It can also separate diastereomers and structurally different compounds. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Compound 1, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, is a single chiral compound. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compound 2, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, is its diastereomer and will have a different retention time. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compound 3, meso-pentane-2,4-diol, is achiral but is diastereomeric to the other diols and will have its own retention time. **(1 peak)**\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5, the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair, will be separated by the chiral column. **(2 peaks)**\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon C5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to two possible stereoisomers. Since the starting material already possesses a stereocenter at C5 that is unaffected by the reaction, the two products formed will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomers are produced.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This pair of molecules are non-superimposable mirror images, making them enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) one.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are produced: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.

(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) pair from Reaction II, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, which have different physical properties, are separable.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will produce **two separate peaks**.\n    *   In Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the racemic mixture will produce one peak, and the meso compound will produce a second, separate peak, for a total of **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The two separable compounds from Reaction I and the two separable sets of compounds from Reaction II are all structurally different and will have unique retention times. Thus, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\nChiral HPLC is designed to separate enantiomers by using a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer. It can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   The five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into five separate peaks.\n    *   **Reaction I:** The two diastereomers ((3S, 5S) and (3R, 5S)) will be separated, resulting in **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) from each other, and the achiral meso compound will elute as its own distinct peak. This results in **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the resolved stereoisomers from both reactions, which is 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option stating 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to determine the number of distinct chemical compounds produced by two separate reactions and then figure out how many peaks these combined products will show on two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): normal-phase and chiral.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone. The \"(S)\" indicates it has a specific 3D arrangement at carbon number 5, making it a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will convert the ketone group (C=O) at carbon 3 into a secondary alcohol group (CH-OH).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original chiral center at carbon 5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged. The reduction of the ketone at carbon 3 creates a *new* chiral center. The hydride from LAH can attack the flat carbonyl group from two different faces (top or bottom). This lack of selectivity at the new center means two different stereoisomers will be formed.\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:** The products will have configurations at both carbon 3 and carbon 5. Since C5 is fixed as (S), the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This gives two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have more than one chiral center, and they are not mirror images of each other.\n    *   **Count:** Reaction I produces **2** stereoisomeric products.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule has two ketone groups and is **achiral** (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is also a reducing agent. \"Excess\" means it will reduce *both* ketone groups to secondary alcohol groups.\n    *   **Product Structure:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the two ketones creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4. Let's analyze the possible combinations of R/S configurations:\n        *   (2R, 4R)\n        *   (2S, 4S)\n        *   (2R, 4S)\n        *   (2S, 4R)\n    *   Now, let's check the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it an achiral, **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound, just flipped over.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction starts with an achiral molecule, so it must produce either achiral products or a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of enantiomers. Here, we get both. We get the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Count:** Reaction II produces **3** distinct stereoisomeric products: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n4.  **Combine the Products:**\n    *   From Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.\n    *   From Reaction II: 2 enantiomers + 1 meso compound.\n    *   Total unique compounds in the final mixture = 2 + 3 = **5 stereoisomers**.\n\n5.  **Analyze HPLC Separations:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, mainly polarity.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they **cannot be separated** by normal-phase HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   **Diastereomers** (and constitutional isomers) have different physical properties, so they **can be separated**.\n        *   Let's count the peaks:\n            1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will separate. That's **2 peaks**.\n            2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will *not* separate. That's **1 peak**.\n            3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the other products from Reaction II, so it will separate. That's **1 peak**.\n        *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with enantiomers.\n        *   It can separate **all stereoisomers**, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n        *   Therefore, the number of peaks will be equal to the total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n        *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Matching:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nNow I will write the Python code to formalize this step-by-step reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC for the combined products.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    # Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one (chiral ketone)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\n    # The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n    # This results in two products that are diastereomers of each other.\n    products_I = [\"(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\", \"(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\"]\n    num_products_I = len(products_I)\n    print(f\"Reaction I produces {num_products_I} products (diastereomers).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    # Starting material: Pentane-2,4-dione (achiral diketone)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of both ketones creates two new chiral centers (C2, C4).\n    # The possible stereoisomers are (2R,4R), (2S,4S), and a meso compound (2R,4S).\n    # (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) are a pair of enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers.\n    products_II = [\"(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\", \"(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\", \"meso-pentane-2,4-diol\"]\n    num_products_II = len(products_II)\n    print(f\"Reaction II produces {num_products_II} products (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound).\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine all products\n    all_products = products_I + products_II\n    total_unique_stereoisomers = len(all_products)\n    print(f\"\\nTotal unique stereoisomers in the combined mixture: {total_unique_stereoisomers}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate peaks in Chiral HPLC\n    # Chiral HPLC separates all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    chiral_hplc_peaks = total_unique_stereoisomers\n    print(f\"Chiral HPLC can separate all {total_unique_stereoisomers} stereoisomers.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of peaks in chiral HPLC is: {chiral_hplc_peaks}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC\n    # Normal-phase HPLC separates diastereomers but NOT enantiomers.\n    # Peaks from Reaction I: The two products are diastereomers, so they separate.

This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon 5. The ketone at carbon 3 is prochiral.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting molecule already has a chiral center at C5, the hydride attack on the carbonyl can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the existing chiral center can influence the reaction, these two diastereomers will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is symmetric, we must analyze the stereoisomers formed.\n    *   Possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). Thus, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers in total: the (2R,4R) enantiomer, the (2S,4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture with HPLC**\n\nWe have a total of five different stereoisomers in the mixture:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   The products of Reaction I are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C7 ether-alcohol vs. C5 diol), so they will be separated from each other.\n*   Within the products of Reaction II, the racemic pair ((2R,4R) + (2S,4S)) and the meso compound are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on a normal-phase column. The two enantiomers within the racemic pair will not be separated and will elute as a single peak. Thus, the products of Reaction II will give **2 peaks**.\n*   This problem can be interpreted in a way common for academic questions, where the complex Reaction I is treated as a distractor, and the question is focused on the classic outcome of Reaction II. If we only consider the products of Reaction II, we observe **2 peaks** in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n*   A chiral HPLC column is designed to interact differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   Following the interpretation that the question focuses on the products of Reaction II:\n    *   The two enantiomers, (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the other two and will elute as a third distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the products of Reaction II will show **3 peaks** on a chiral HPLC column.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the interpretation that the question is designed to test the analysis of the products from the classic reduction of a symmetric β-diketone (Reaction II), we find:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks (one for each of the two enantiomers and one for the meso compound).\n\nThis matches option A. If we were to consider all 5 products from both reactions assuming ideal separation, we would get 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in chiral HPLC (Option B). However, the structure of the provided options makes the \"distractor\" interpretation the most likely intended solution path.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  Identify all products and their stereochemical relationships (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso).\n2.  Understand the separation principles of normal-phase (achiral) HPLC: separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but not enantiomers.\n3.  Understand the separation principles of chiral HPLC: separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n4.  Recognize that in multiple-choice questions, sometimes a simpler or more classic part of the problem is the intended focus, and other information may be a distractor. The clean match between the analysis of Reaction II alone and Option A is a strong indicator of this intent.\n\nFinal Answer is determined by analyzing the products of Reaction II.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing one stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration. The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH, LiAlH4) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong, achiral reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either the front or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S). The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Two products are formed, which are diastereomers of each other.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    Since they are diastereomers, they are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). NaBH4 is an achiral reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohol groups.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the two prochiral ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC.**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Principle:** Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different physical properties (including polarity) and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated; they will co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will have different polarities and will resolve into **2 separate peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of a racemic pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute, giving **1 peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will have a different polarity, giving another **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have very different retention times.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from the enantiomeric pair in Rxn II) + 1 (from the meso compound in Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column can separate all stereochemically distinct molecules: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** We have a total of five unique stereoisomers in our mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of them, each compound will produce a distinct peak.\n*   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction I:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position. Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH) creates a new stereocenter. Because a new stereocenter is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two possible products are diastereomers. The starting (S) configuration at C5 remains unchanged, while the new alcohol at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two distinct diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. Treatment with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound, (2R, 4S). The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral and is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, containing the products from both reactions, consists of a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can distinguish between constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute as a **single peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different molecules and will have different retention times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC utilizes a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. The different stereoisomers interact differently with the CSP, leading to different retention times.\n\n*   Each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved by the chiral column.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (Peak 5)\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC will be **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone. It has one existing chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at carbon 3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using lithium aluminum hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new chiral center at carbon 3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl group are not equivalent. The hydride can attack from either face, leading to the formation of two different products. These products, (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n**Outcome of Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can result in three possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (which is a meso compound and identical to the 2S,4R form).\n*   The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses an achiral reagent, this pair is formed as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture). The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Outcome of Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a racemic mixture of two enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and polarities, so they will be separated.\n*   **Meso compounds** are diastereomers of chiral isomers and will also be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks from our mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer to the other products from Reaction II and will form a **separate peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules with different polarities and will not co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from the enantiomeric pair in Reaction II) + 1 (from the meso compound in Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   The column will interact differently with each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture, allowing for their separation.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be resolved.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from the other isomers.\n\nAssuming the chiral column is effective, it will resolve all five stereoisomers present in the final mixture.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting products to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3, which is a prochiral center, creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because one stereocenter (C5) is the same in both molecules, while the other stereocenter (C3) is different.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, which has two stereocenters (at C2 and C4). This reaction produces three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (this is a meso compound, as it has a plane of symmetry, and is identical to the (2S, 4R) form).\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. The meso isomer is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are indistinguishable in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties, so it will be separated, resulting in a **second peak** from Reaction II's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally different molecules and will not co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other:\n    *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the other two, will elute separately, giving a **third peak**.\n*   Again, it is assumed that none of the five distinct compounds accidentally co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone. It has one existing stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone functional group (C=O) at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between Products:** Since the products have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both ketones are fully reduced.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they form a **pair of enantiomers**.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the C3 methylene group). A molecule with stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products:** Reaction II produces three stereoisomers in total: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **3. Combine Products and Analyze with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, which are five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol    (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol    (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol        (from Rxn II)\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each type of HPLC.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Separates:** Constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Does NOT Separate:** Enantiomers, because they have identical physical properties (polarity, boiling point, etc.) in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Counting:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will be separated**, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II are the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute and appear as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n        *   So, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are constitutional isomers with significantly different polarities (diols are much more polar). They will be well-separated from each other.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n*   **Separates:** All different stereoisomers, including enantiomers, diastereomers, and meso compounds.\n*   **Peak Counting:**\n    *   The five products are all unique stereoisomers. The chiral column will interact differently with each one, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The parent chain is hexane. A ketone is at C-3, and a methoxy group is at C-5. The numbering starts from the end that gives the ketone the lowest number:\n        CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n        1   2   3     4    5        6\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at C-5, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH reduces the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C-5 is unaffected by the reaction. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either face, leading to both possible configurations (R and S) at the newly formed chiral center (C-3).\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Since the products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C-5) but opposite configurations at the other (C-3), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C-2 and C-4 creates two new chiral centers.\n    *   CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction is not stereoselective, so it will produce a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of these two enantiomers.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the central CH₂ group). A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound). The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture on HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol         (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol      (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol      (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will have different properties and will give a **separate peak**.\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together, giving a **single peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will certainly elute at different times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** We will have one peak for each of the following: (Compound 1), (Compound 2), (Compound 3), and (Compounds 4+5).\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The chiral column can distinguish between all different stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1) -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 3: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, but a diastereomer of all others) -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are an enantiomeric pair. The chiral column will separate them.\n        *   Compound 4: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n        *   Compound 5: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃`\n    *   Key feature: It possesses a single chiral center at Carbon-5 (C5) with a defined (S) configuration. This makes the entire molecule chiral.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a powerful reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The starting molecule is chiral, but the reagent (LAH) is achiral. The reduction of the prochiral carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces. This results in the formation of two products with different configurations at the newly formed C3 stereocenter.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement at one (but not all) of their stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct stereoisomeric products (diastereomers).\n\n#### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting compound is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    *   Key feature: This molecule is symmetric and **achiral**.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. Since the molecule is symmetric and two chiral centers are created, we must look for meso compounds and enantiomeric pairs.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral reactants, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomeric products: one meso compound and a racemic pair of two enantiomers.\n\n#### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions, for a total of **five** unique stereoisomers.\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will not be separated from each other and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair).\n    *   The products of Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (C₇ ether-alcohol vs. C₅ diol) and will not co-elute.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all stereoisomers (both enantiomers and diastereomers).\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column will resolve all five of these compounds into distinct peaks (assuming ideal separation).\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   The chromatogram from the **chiral HPLC** will show **5 peaks**.\n*   The chromatogram from the **normal-phase HPLC** will show **4 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, provided as a single enantiomer. The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃, with the stereocenter at carbon 5 having the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the carbonyl group at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3. Since the starting material is chiral, the environment of the reaction is chiral. The hydride (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are generally formed in unequal amounts in such a reaction.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of two ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ will reduce both carbonyls to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. Since the starting material is achiral, the overall product mixture must be optically inactive.\n*   **Products:** Three stereoisomers are possible:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry (and is identical to the (2S, 4R) structure). This makes it an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of both the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds in total: two diastereomers from Reaction I and three stereoisomers (a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers) from Reaction II.\n\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   **Enantiomers**, like the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, such as the two products from Reaction I, have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **two peaks**.\n    *   The meso diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair from the same reaction. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives one peak for the meso compound and one peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair. This is **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so they will be well-separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** We sum the separable groups:\n    *   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 3: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n    *   Peak 4: (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (co-eluting enantiomers)\n\nThus, we observe **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:** A chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks:** We count each unique stereoisomer in the 5-component mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1 from Rxn I) -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2 from Rxn I) -> **1 peak**\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 1 from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 2 from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n\nSince all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and a chiral column can resolve both diastereomers and enantiomers, we expect to see **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC (assuming ideal separation with no accidental co-elution).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave during the chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to an alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure and a new stereocenter is formed, the two resulting products will be diastereomers: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Summary for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to alcohols by sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two stereocenters in the product, pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound.\n*   **Summary for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, the mixture contains a total of **five** different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer A)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer B)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer C)\n4.

Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Diastereomers A and B have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   Enantiomers C and D are indistinguishable on an achiral column and will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   Meso compound E is a diastereomer of C and D, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **one peak**.\nThe products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally distinct molecules with different polarities and will be well separated from each other.\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Diastereomers A and B will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   Enantiomers C and D will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   Meso compound E, being a distinct achiral molecule, will produce **one peak**.\nAs a result, all five compounds in the mixture will be separated from one another.\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from the resolved enantiomers) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe user's question can be broken down by analyzing the products of each reaction and then determining how they will behave in two different types of liquid chromatography.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position in the S configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a powerful reducing agent. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, resulting in two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter (C3). Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (S configuration), the products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can lead to three different stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images and are therefore a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined and analyzed.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. It is capable of separating diastereomers but cannot resolve enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of Products:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products consist of a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will behave as a single substance on an achiral column and elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers and will elute separately, giving a second peak. This results in a total of **2 peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 compounds) and will have different retention times. Therefore, the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to differentiate between enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of Products:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) into **2 distinct peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated, yielding a third peak. This results in **3 peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Since the products of the two reactions are structurally distinct, they will all be resolved. The total number of peaks is the sum of all unique stereoisomers produced: 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction I:** The reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) targets the ketone functional group at the C-3 position. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C-3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. Since the original stereocenter at C-5 remains in the (S) configuration, the products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Reaction II:** The reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups at C-2 and C-4, creating two new stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are (2R,4R), (2S,4S), and (2R,4S). The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R,4S) isomer is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Thus, this reaction yields three distinct stereoisomers: the (2R,4R)-diol, the (2S,4S)-diol, and the meso-diol.\n\n### Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (from Reaction II)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Constitutional Isomers:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) have different molecular formulas and structures, so they will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers:** These have different physical properties, including polarity, and are separable by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will result in **two separate peaks**.\n    *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers, yielding **one peak for the meso compound** and **one peak for the enantiomeric pair**.\n*   **Enantiomers:** These have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a normal-phase column. The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) enantiomers from Reaction II will elute together as a single peak.\n\nCombining these points, the separable entities are: the two distinct diastereomers from Reaction I, the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, and the meso compound from Reaction II. This results in a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. It achieves this because the enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct from one another.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from Reaction II from each other.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is also chemically distinct and will be separated from all other isomers.\n\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all five stereoisomers, resulting in **5 peaks** in the chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to the conclusion that there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products of two separate reactions and then determining how those products will behave in two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products:** The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at the newly formed alcohol center (C3).\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Products 1A and 1B have one identical chiral center (5S) and one opposite chiral center (3R vs. 3S). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (`CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`).\n    *   This molecule is achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the products must be either achiral or a racemic mixture of chiral molecules. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are **enantiomers**. The reaction produces them in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's predict the number of peaks for each HPLC type.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Constitutional isomers and diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is one distinct compound. (Peak 1)\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is a diastereomer of the above compound, so it will have different properties and will separate. (Peak 2)\n    3.  **Racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These are enantiomers and will co-elute as one peak. (Peak 3)\n    4.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) diols. It will have different properties and will separate from their peak. (Peak 4)\n*   Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral stationary phase can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all compounds that are not identical.\n*   It separates constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n*   Let's count the separable compounds:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (Peak 1)\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (diastereomer of 1, will separate) (Peak 2)\n    3.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** (Peak 3)\n    4.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (enantiomer of 3, will separate on a chiral column) (Peak 4)\n    5.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol** (diastereomer of 3 and 4, will separate) (Peak 5)\n*   All five stereoisomers are unique and will be resolved by a chiral column.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave in the different chromatography systems.\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This ketone has one existing chiral center at the C5 position with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers. Since the starting material already has a chiral center at C5 that is unaffected by the reaction, the two products will be diastereomers:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral β-diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of both ketones produces pentane-2,4-diol, which has two chiral centers at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R), which are identical due to a plane of symmetry)\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral and is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Product Analysis for HPLC\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, however, have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nAnalyzing the peaks for the combined mixture on a normal-phase column:\n1.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is one of the diastereomers from Reaction I.\n2.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is the second diastereomer from Reaction I and will have a different retention time from the first.\n3.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** This compound is a diastereomer of the other pentane-2,4-diol products and will be separated.\n4.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This pair of enantiomers will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n\nAssuming the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different enough to have unique retention times, we would observe a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n#### Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC\n\nA chiral stationary phase provides a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\nAnalyzing the peaks for the combined mixture on a chiral column:\n1.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n2.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n3.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n4.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n5.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol**\n\nEach of these five compounds will be resolved, resulting in **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of HPLC peaks.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. The acidic workup protonates the intermediate.\n    *   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C5. However, the reduction of the planar ketone at C3 creates a *new* chiral center. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two stereoisomeric products (a pair of diastereomers) are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.

It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze Combined Products on HPLC:**\n    *   We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in the final mixture:\n        *   From Reaction I (2 compounds): (3R, 5S)-alcohol, (3S, 5S)-alcohol.\n        *   From Reaction II (3 compounds): (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and the (2R, 4S)-meso-diol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and will *not* be separated; they elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Let's count the peaks:\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different polarities and will produce **2 separate peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has a different polarity, so it will produce its own, separate peak (**1 peak**). This gives 2 peaks from Reaction II's products.\n    *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, a chiral column can resolve all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n    *   Let's count the peaks:\n        *   The 2 diastereomers from Reaction I are distinct and will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n        *   The 3 stereoisomers from Reaction II (the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound) are all distinct from each other and will be resolved, giving **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Chiral HPLC Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC, which matches option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC experiments.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction I ---\n    # Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\n    # The starting material has one chiral center (C5, S-config).\n    # LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center.\n    # The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n    # This reaction produces two diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    products_rxn1_count = 2\n    products_rxn1_desc = \"Two diastereomers\"\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reaction II ---\n    # Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\n    # The starting material is achiral.\n    # NaBH4 reduces both ketones (at C2 and C4) to alcohols, creating two new chiral centers.\n    # This produces three stereoisomers:\n    # 1.

This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   The stereocenter at C5 is already defined.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration will be retained.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl. Since the molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the two faces are diastereotopic. This means the attack is not equally likely from both sides, but it will still produce a mixture of two products. These products will have different configurations at the newly formed stereocenter (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** A mixture of two diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both groups are reduced. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the two ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Since the starting material is achiral, we need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   Possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's examine the (2R, 4S) structure. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable), so there is only one meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers.\n    *   Product 2A: A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Product 2B: The meso compound, (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the HPLC Chromatograms**\nThe products from both reactions are combined. The final mixture contains five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II.** The products from Reaction I are C₇ alcohols with an ether group (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols), while the products from Reaction II are C₅ diols (pentane-2,4-diols). These are structurally very different and will have different retention times on any HPLC column. Thus, no peak from Reaction I will overlap with a peak from Reaction II.\n\n*   **Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. This will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   Total from Reaction II: 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers).\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are different compounds and will be separated. This will give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be separated by the chiral column. This will give **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is a distinct stereoisomer and will elute separately from the two enantiomers. This will give **1 peak**.\n        *   Total from Reaction II: 2 + 1 = **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The \"hexan-3-one\" part tells us it's a 6-carbon chain with a ketone (C=O) at carbon 3.\n    *   The \"5-methoxy\" part indicates a methoxy group (-OCH3) on carbon 5.\n    *   The \"(S)\" designation indicates that the stereocenter at carbon 5 has the S configuration.\n    *   The structure is: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3. This is a chiral molecule, and we start with a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH reduces ketones to alcohols. The carbonyl group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) from LAH (an achiral reagent) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of two stereocenters (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since they are formed from a chiral starting material by an achiral reagent, they will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** (it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group).\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" reagent ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n\n3.  **Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso form.\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers** and are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a **meso compound**. It has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. It is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single, achiral molecule.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Combined Mixture Analysis with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of 5 different compounds:\n1.

It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable components:\n    *   Compounds **1** and **2** are diastereomers.

The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, creates a new stereocenter. This reaction results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers, meaning they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. Reduction with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) converts both ketone groups into hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This process creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are:\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (a meso compound)\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses an achiral reagent, this pair of enantiomers is produced as a racemic mixture (an equal mixture of both). The (2R, 4S) isomer is a meso compound, which is achiral and is a diastereomer of the other two isomers. In total, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\nThe combined products from both reactions are analyzed using two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which have identical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different polarities and will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The product mixture contains a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable under these conditions and will elute together as a **single peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different retention time, appearing as a **separate peak**. This gives a total of **two peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption given their different molecular structures), the total number of peaks in the normal-phase chromatogram is the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\nTotal peaks = 2 (from I) + 2 (from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis method uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, yielding **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) from each other, resulting in **two distinct peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the others, will also be separated, eluting as a **third peak**. Therefore, the products of Reaction II will show **three peaks**.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of all separated compounds.\nTotal peaks = 2 (from I) + 3 (from II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone. It is treated with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter.\n*   Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S) at C5) and the reducing agent (LAH) is achiral, the reaction produces a mixture of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one chiral center (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral dione. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups, followed by an acidic workup. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   Three stereoisomers are formed from this reaction:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\nIn total, five different compounds are produced from the two reactions.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined products from both reactions are analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, meaning it has different physical properties and will be separated, appearing as a distinct peak.\n    *   This will result in a total of **two peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The two diastereomers from Reaction I and the two groups of stereoisomers (the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound) from Reaction II are all structurally distinct molecules with different polarities. Therefore, they will all be separated from each other.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers in addition to other isomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, just as they were on the normal-phase column. This gives **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    *   The chiral column will now resolve the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will elute as its own **one peak**.\n    *   This results in a total of **three peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of unique compounds is five, and a chiral column has the ability to separate all of them.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and chromatographic separations:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a ketone and possesses a single chiral center at the C5 position with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is optically pure (only the S isomer is present), the hydride from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces. This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers, as one stereocenter is the same (5S) while the other is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral dione.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This can result in three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer).\n*   Therefore, this reaction produces a total of three distinct stereoisomers: the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.

They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, on the other hand, have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute and produce **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus producing a **separate peak**.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from enantiomeric pair) + 1 (from meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   **Enantiomers can be separated** by a chiral column.\n*   **Diastereomers**, being distinct compounds, will also be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The two enantiomers from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column and produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a distinct achiral molecule, will produce its own **separate peak**.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 (from Reaction II meso compound) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **5 peaks** in the chromatogram from the chiral HPLC and **4 peaks** in the chromatogram from the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-*CH(OCH3)-CH3 (the asterisk indicates the chiral center).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. Since the starting material has one chiral center (C5), and a new one is formed at C3, the products will be diastereomers. The attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new C3 center. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** We need to determine the possible stereoisomers. With two chiral centers, there is a maximum of 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the substituents on C2 and C4 are identical), we must check for meso compounds. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The (2R, 4S) configuration is achiral because of a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound). The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and thus constitute a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reduction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the separation of the combined mixture on a normal-phase HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The combined mixture contains five compounds in total (two from Reaction I, three from Reaction II).\n    *   From Reaction I: We have two diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are generally separable by achiral chromatography. This would produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: We have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), are inseparable in an achiral environment and will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving another **1 peak**.\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II would produce a total of **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times. Thus, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n    *   **Textbook/Ideal Case:** Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n    *   **Practical/Simplified Case:** Often, diastereomers with very similar structures can be difficult to separate on a standard column. A common simplifying assumption in such problems is that only compounds with significant structural differences are resolved. The C7 ether-alcohols from Rxn I are structurally different from the C5 diols from Rxn II. Within each group, the diastereomers are very similar. Under this assumption, the two diastereomers from Rxn I would elute as one unresolved peak, and the diastereomeric products from Rxn II (racemic pair and meso form) would elute as another unresolved peak. This leads to **2 peaks**.\n    *   Looking at the options, both 4-peak and 2-peak scenarios for normal phase are presented. This suggests we need to consider the chiral separation to decide.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the separation of the combined mixture on a chiral HPLC column.**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to separate enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   From Reaction I: The two diastereomers, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S), will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: We have three stereoisomers.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will be separated by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral, but it is a diastereomer of the other two compounds and will have a different retention time from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II give a total of **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Textbook/Ideal Case:** Assuming the chiral column works perfectly and there are no accidental co-elutions, the total number of peaks would be the sum of all unique stereoisomers. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the analysis with the given options.**\n*   **Scenario 1 (Ideal \"Textbook\" Separation):** 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in chiral HPLC. This matches **Option B**.\n*   **Scenario 2 (Plausible \"Practical\" Limitations):** Let's re-evaluate based on the options. Option C suggests 2 normal-phase peaks and 4 chiral peaks.\n    *   **2 Normal-phase peaks:** This corresponds to the simplified case where diastereomers from the same reaction are not resolved, but the products from Rxn I are separated from the products of Rxn II. This is a plausible interpretation.\n    *   **4 Chiral peaks:** This implies that out of the 5 unique stereoisomers, two are co-eluting. A chiral column is designed to separate enantiomers, but it might fail for a specific pair. A more plausible scenario for a 4-peak outcome is the column successfully separates the enantiomers from Rxn II, but fails to resolve the diastereomers from Rxn I. Or vice versa. Let's assume the column resolves the diastereomers from Rxn I (2 peaks) and the meso diol from Rxn II (1 peak), but fails to resolve the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II (1 peak). Total = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 peaks. This is a consistent line of reasoning based on plausible instrumental limitations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are two main lines of reasoning:\n1.  The \"textbook\" approach assumes ideal separation for any compounds that are theoretically separable. This leads to 4 peaks (normal) and 5 peaks (chiral) -> **Option B**.\n2.  The \"practical\" approach assumes plausible limitations. A simple normal-phase column might only separate the two main classes of compounds (2 peaks). A chiral column might resolve most things but fail on one pair, for instance, the enantiomers from Reaction II, leading to 4 peaks. This logic leads to 4 chiral peaks and 2 normal peaks -> **Option C**.\n\nIn chemistry problems of this type, it is common to test the nuanced understanding of practical chromatography. The scenario where the normal-phase column gives poor resolution (separating only the two distinct families of products) and the chiral column resolves diastereomers but fails to resolve one enantiomeric pair is a consistent and plausible \"real-world\" scenario that leads directly to option C. The assumption that the normal-phase separation is not perfect (2 peaks) is quite reasonable. The assumption that a chiral column resolves diastereomers but might not resolve a specific enantiomeric pair (leading to 4 peaks) is also a reasonable consideration of practical limitations.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning for Option C is as follows:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC (2 peaks):** The two diastereomers from Reaction I are structurally similar and co-elute. The racemic and meso diols from Reaction II are also structurally similar and co-elute. However, the C7 ether-alcohols (Rxn I) are different enough from the C5 diols (Rxn II) to be separated from each other.\n*   **Chiral HPLC (4 peaks):** A chiral column can separate diastereomers. Let's assume the two diastereomers from Reaction I are separated (2 peaks). The meso diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and is also separated (1 peak). However, let's assume this specific chiral column is unable to resolve the enantiomeric pair of pentane-2,4-diol, so they co-elute (1 peak). Total peaks = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 peaks.\n\nThis provides a consistent explanation for Option C.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one pre-existing stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3. The hydride anion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter in common (S at C5) and one that is different (R vs. S at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, as it is used in excess. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   The pentane-2,4-diol molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through C3. If the configurations at C2 and C4 are opposite (one R, one S), the molecule is achiral due to this internal symmetry. This is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single meso compound.\n*   Thus, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: the (2R,4R)/(2S,4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the separation on a normal-phase HPLC column**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC, eluting as separate peaks.\n*   Let's count the peaks from the combined product mixture:\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different retention time. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** It is reasonable to assume that the products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally and chemically different enough to have distinct retention times and not co-elute by accident.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram is 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the separation on a chiral HPLC column**\n\n*   An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all distinct stereoisomers.\n*   Let's count the peaks from the combined product mixture, which contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. -> **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)). The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions, the total number of peaks will be the total number of unique stereoisomers present.\n*   Total number of peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis on the **normal-phase HPLC** predicts **4 peaks**.\n*   The analysis on the **chiral HPLC** predicts **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon C-5 with an (S) configuration. The ketone group at C-3 is prochiral, meaning the two faces of the carbonyl group are not equivalent.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is reduced by lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C-3.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the *Re* face or the *Si* face, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers at the new center C-3: one with an (R) configuration and one with an (S) configuration. The original chiral center at C-5 is not part of the reaction and retains its (S) configuration.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since these two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C-5) and opposite configurations at the other (C-3), they are **diastereomers**.\n\nConclusion for Reaction I: **Two distinct compounds (a pair of diastereomers) are formed.**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomeric products.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses achiral reagents, this pair will be produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C-3 methylene group. It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the exact same meso molecule.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.

Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is a symmetrical molecule and is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:**\n    *   For a molecule with two chiral centers, there is a maximum of 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   Now consider (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R). Because the molecule is symmetrical (the groups attached to C2 are the same as the groups attached to C4), the (2R, 4S) isomer possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. It is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces three stereoisomeric products: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    *   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II:\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will not be separated from each other and will elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different physical properties. It will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are constitutionally different molecules and will have different retention times. There will be no accidental overlap.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC Column**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to interact differently with enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column can separate enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   Let's count the number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a chiral molecule)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (a chiral molecule)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (an achiral molecule, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   All five of these compounds are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all five compounds.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to the option stating \"5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\".\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), an achiral reagent, creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack the carbonyl group from either face.\n*   **Products:** This non-selective attack results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one stereocenter (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral dione.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups (at C2 and C4) with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Products:** Three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are formed:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them an enantiomeric pair.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound. It is a diastereomer of the other two isomers.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers, but it can separate diastereomers and structurally different molecules.\n\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The mixture contains an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. Enantiomers are not separated on an achiral column and will elute together as **one peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, appearing as a **second peak**.\n3.  **Combined Mixture:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be the sum of the separable groups: 2 peaks from Reaction I products + 2 peaks from Reaction II products = **4 peaks**.\n\n### Chiral HPLC\n\nA chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   The chiral column can distinguish between all five stereoisomers in the mixture because each one is structurally unique.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a diastereomer of the others, will also have a unique retention time and appear as a separate peak.\n\nSince all five stereoisomers are different, the chiral HPLC will resolve the mixture into **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone that is enantiomerically pure, with a single stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is reduced using Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction converts the ketone group at C3 into a hydroxyl group, creating a new stereocenter at this position.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is chiral, the two faces of the planar ketone are not equivalent. The hydride can attack from either the front or the back, leading to the formation of two different products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography techniques.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), which will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reduction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can result in three different stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Products Analysis by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer A)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer B)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has different properties, so it will be separated. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally distinct and will have different retention times.\nThus, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of these separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   The column will separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: **1 peak**\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: **1 peak**\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak**\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak**\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol: **1 peak** (as it is chemically different from the others).\nTherefore, a total of **5 peaks** will be observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe final analysis is as follows:\n\n### Reaction I Analysis\n*   **Reactant**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction converts the carbonyl group into a hydroxyl group, creating a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products**: The hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group is not stereospecific and can occur from either face. This leads to the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they differ at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n\n### Reaction II Analysis\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of both ketone groups using excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This reaction creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products**: The reduction results in three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which are a pair of enantiomers.

(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n### Chromatogram Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the racemic pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will elute together as a **single peak** because enantiomers are not separated.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the racemic pair and will have a different retention time, resulting in a separate, **second peak** from Reaction II's products.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) have different molecular formulas and structures, they will elute at different times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   This will result in a total of **5 peaks** in the chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH₄) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral (at C5), the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the prochiral carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means the two faces of the carbonyl are not equivalent, and the hydride will attack preferentially from one side, but both possible products will be formed. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol. These two molecules are **diastereomers**. They will be produced in unequal amounts, but since the reaction goes to completion, both will be present in the final mixture.\n    *   Let's call them **Product A** and **Product B**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This is a symmetrical, achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that there is enough reagent to reduce both ketone groups. The reaction goes to 100% completion.\n*   **Product Formation:** Both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and the reagent are achiral, the product mixture must be achiral overall (i.e., any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and meso-(2R, 4S).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are **enantiomers**. They are produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   Let's call them **Product C** and **Product D**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a **meso compound**. It is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry. It is a **diastereomer** of the (R,R) and (S,S) isomers.\n        *   Let's call this **Product E**.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds:\n*   From Rxn I: Product A and Product B (diastereomers).\n*   From Rxn II: Product C and Product D (enantiomers), and Product E (their diastereomer).\n*   Note: The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers (or more accurately, just different compounds) and will be easily separated by chromatography.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks on a Normal-Phase HPLC Column**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like C and D) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they will **not** be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like A and B; and like the pair (C+D) vs E) have different physical properties, including polarity. Therefore, they **will** be separated and elute as different peaks.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (or different compounds like the C7 products vs the C5 products) have different structures and polarities and **will** be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  Peak 1: Product A ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol)\n2.  Peak 2: Product B ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol) - Separated from A because they are diastereomers.\n3.  Peak 3: Product C + Product D ((R,R)/(S,S)-pentane-2,4-diol) - Co-elute because they are enantiomers.\n4.  Peak 4: Product E (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separated from (C+D) because they are diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, we expect to see **4 peaks** on the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It also separates molecules that are already separable on a normal-phase column (diastereomers and constitutional isomers). Essentially, a chiral column can separate all non-identical chemical species.\n\nLet's count the peaks for our five distinct compounds:\n1.  Peak 1: Product A ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol)\n2.  Peak 2: Product B ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol) - Separates from A (diastereomer).\n3.  Peak 3: Product C ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n4.  Peak 4: Product D ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separates from C because they are enantiomers and the column is chiral.\n5.  Peak 5: Product E (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) - Separates from C and D (diastereomer).\n\nTherefore, we expect to see **5 peaks** on the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n### Analysis of Reactions and Products\n\n#### Reaction I\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone with the stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Because the starting material is chiral, the hydride attack on the carbonyl group is diastereoselective, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n**Products from Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.**\n\n#### Reaction II\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to alcohols, creating two new stereocenters in the product, pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture. The (2S, 4R) isomer has a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound.\n\n**Products from Reaction II: 3 stereoisomers (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).**\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined, resulting in a mixture of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\nA normal-phase HPLC column is an achiral stationary phase that separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Constitutional Isomers:** The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) have different chemical formulas and structures, so they will be separated from each other.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso compound ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will give one peak, and the unseparated pair of enantiomers will give another peak, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II, all these groups will be resolved.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. The CSP interacts differently with each stereoisomer, allowing for their separation.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is diastereomeric to all other compounds and will be separated.\n*   The pair of enantiomers from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks by the chiral column.\n*   Therefore, all five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** Determine the products formed from the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Pay close attention to the stereochemistry.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** Determine the products formed from the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione. Identify all stereoisomers (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds).\n3.  **Count Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on polarity. Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different polarities and will separate, but enantiomers have identical polarities in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak.\n4.  **Count Peaks in Chiral-Phase HPLC:** A chiral stationary phase can differentiate between enantiomers. Therefore, all unique stereoisomers will be resolved and appear as separate peaks.\n5.  **Match the Result:** Compare the calculated number of peaks to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n*   **Reaction I Products:**\n    *   The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It has one chiral center at the C5 position.\n    *   LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   Since LAH is an achiral reagent, it attacks the planar carbonyl group from both faces, producing both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 chiral center.\n    *   The original C5 stereocenter remains unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed: **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** and **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. These two molecules are **diastereomers**.\n\n*   **Reaction II Products:**\n    *   The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n    *   Excess NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, creating two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)** and **(2S, 4S)** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)** has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration).\n    *   Therefore, three distinct stereoisomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The final mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = 5 unique stereoisomers.\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC Analysis (Achiral):**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)) have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)) is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will separate, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols), so they will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral-Phase HPLC Analysis:**\n    *   A chiral column separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the total mixture, the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n    *   Total peaks in chiral-phase HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\n# The reactant (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is chiral.\n# The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\n# This results in two diastereomeric products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\nproducts_reaction1 = 2 # Diastereomers\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\n# The reactant pentane-2,4-dione is achiral.\n# The reduction creates two new chiral centers (C2 and C4).\n# This results in a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound ((2R, 4S)).\nenantiomers_reaction2 = 2\nmeso_compounds_reaction2 = 1\nproducts_reaction2 = enantiomers_reaction2 + meso_compounds_reaction2 # Total unique stereoisomers from Reaction II\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique compounds in the mixture.\ntotal_unique_compounds = products_reaction1 + products_reaction2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of peaks in Chiral-Phase HPLC.\n# A chiral column separates all unique stereoisomers.\nchiral_hplc_peaks = total_unique_compounds\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the number of peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC.\n# A normal (achiral) column separates diastereomers and constitutional isomers, but not enantiomers.\n# Peaks from Reaction I: The 2 products are diastereomers, so they separate.\npeaks_from_rxn1_normal = 2\n# Peaks from Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair co-elutes (1 peak), and the meso compound gives a separate peak.\npeaks_from_rxn2_normal = 1 + meso_compounds_reaction2\n# Total peaks are the sum, as products from Rxn I and II are structurally different and won't overlap.\nnormal_phase_hplc_peaks = peaks_from_rxn1_normal + peaks_from_rxn2_normal\n\n# Step 6: Present the results and determine the correct option.\nprint(f\"Number of products from Reaction I: {products_reaction1}\")\nprint(f\"Number of products from Reaction II: {products_reaction2}\")\nprint(f\"Total unique compounds in the mixture: {total_unique_compounds}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC: {normal_phase_hplc_peaks}\")\nprint(f\"Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: {chiral_hplc_peaks}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"The result is:\")\nprint(f\"{chiral_hplc_peaks} Peaks in chiral HPLC and {normal_phase_hplc_peaks} peaks in normal-phase HPLC\")\n\n# Match with options\n# A) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n# B) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n# C) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n# D) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\ncorrect_option = 'B'\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Number of products from Reaction I: 2\nNumber of products from Reaction II: 3\nTotal unique compounds in the mixture: 5\n--------------------\nNumber of peaks in normal-phase HPLC: 4\nNumber of peaks in chiral HPLC: 5\n--------------------\nThe result is:\n5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the prochiral carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter (C3). Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, the products will be a pair of diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The reaction produces a mixture of two diastereomeric alcohols.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of the two).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions. In total, we have **five** distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n*   **Structurally different compounds** (like those from Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different properties and will be separated.\n\nLet's group the products based on how they will behave:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II are the meso-diol and the racemic pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-diols. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Therefore, the meso compound will separate from the racemic pair. The two enantiomers in the racemic pair will co-elute. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   Let's count the number of unique stereoisomers in our mixture: five.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Peak 2 - diastereomer of 1, so it separates)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3 - achiral, but chemically different from all others, so it separates)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5 - enantiomer of 4, separates on a chiral column)\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct (even the meso compound is distinct from the chiral ones), a chiral HPLC column should resolve them all, assuming ideal conditions.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nAn organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed when the combined products are analyzed by normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. To solve this, we must first determine the products of each reaction and then apply the principles of chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5. The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   The chiral center is C5, and its configuration is fixed as (S). The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction converts the ketone group (C=O) at C3 into a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n\n*   **Product(s):** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, leading to two possible stereoisomers at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The starting material already has an (S) configuration at C5. Therefore, the reaction produces a mixture of two products:\n        1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n        2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have different configurations at one chiral center (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This converts both ketone groups into secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Product(s):** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is achiral, the mixture of products must be optically inactive overall.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a **meso compound**. It has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry in one of its conformations. It is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct compounds: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different retention times and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II are (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and the meso (2R, 4S)-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time.\n        *   Therefore, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks** (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂, ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂, diols) have different molecular formulas and structures. They are significantly different in polarity and will be well separated from each other.\n    *   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including **enantiomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   Since all five compounds in the mixture are structurally distinct stereoisomers (or constitutional isomers), they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and have unique retention times.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. As diastereomers, they are separated. **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II: (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and meso-(2R, 4S)-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are separated by the chiral column.\n        *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer to the other two, is also separated.\n        *   This gives **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutionally different and will be separated.\n    *   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n**Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The \"(S)\" designation indicates its specific stereoconfiguration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH, LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The incoming hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible stereoisomers for the newly formed alcohol group (R or S).\n    *   Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged ((S) configuration), the two products will be (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have one identical stereocenter (C5) and one different stereocenter (C3). Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is also a reducing agent capable of reducing ketones to alcohols. The problem specifies excess NaBH₄, ensuring both ketone groups are reduced. The reaction produces pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1 from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2 from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 1 from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 2 from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound from Rxn II)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate **diastereomers** because they have different physical properties, including polarity.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers** because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Analyzing the mixture:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate from each other, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, so it will appear as a separate, single peak (**1 peak**).\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak (**1 peak**).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different and have a different molecular weight than the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), ensuring they will all separate from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 1 (enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC**\n\n*   HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is specifically designed to separate enantiomers. It achieves this by creating a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently, leading to different retention times.\n*   It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   Analyzing the mixture:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from all other compounds (**1 peak**).\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II, which co-eluted on the normal-phase column, will now be resolved into two separate peaks (**2 peaks**).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 2 (enantiomers from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and how they would appear in the different types of HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position (S-configuration).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. LAH is a powerful, nonselective hydride-transfer reagent.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from either face, two stereoisomers will be formed. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (5S) while the other is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, prochiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a milder reducing agent that effectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. It will reduce both ketone groups in pentane-2,4-dione.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. Three possible stereoisomers can be formed:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral and is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture in HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n\n*   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore co-elute (appear as a single peak).\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will separate, giving **one peak**.\n*   The enantiomers (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will not separate from each other and will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers) are structurally distinct and have different polarities compared to the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so it is expected that they will all elute at different times.\n\nThus, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n\n*   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers from each other: diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **one peak**.\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give a separate **peak** (as it's a diastereomer to the first).\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give **one peak**.\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will be resolved from its enantiomer, giving a separate **peak**.\n5.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is structurally different from the other isomers and will have its own distinct **peak**.\n\nTherefore, all five stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated, resulting in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nTo determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and the principles of the separation techniques is necessary.\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The attack of the hydride ion can occur from either face of the planar ketone, resulting in two possible stereoisomers. Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged, the products are diastereomers:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a *meso* compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R) due to an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, Reaction II yields three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S))\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers and are produced as a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the combined mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their polarity.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and can therefore be separated on a normal-phase column. This will result in **two peaks**.\n*   For the products of Reaction II, the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). As diastereomers, they have different polarities and will be separated, giving **two peaks**. The enantiomers within the pair, however, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different molecules (C7H16O2 vs. C5H12O2) and will have sufficiently different polarities to be resolved from each other.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be the sum of the separable components: 2 peaks from Reaction I + 2 peaks from Reaction II = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to separate stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   The mixture contains five chemically distinct stereoisomers.\n*   A chiral column can resolve all of these isomers because each one will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the meso compound and the two enantiomers) will also be separated from each other.\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions, all five stereoisomers will be resolved.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis predicts **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), which is given as the (S) configuration.\n    *   The ketone group is at C3.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. Its reduction will create a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The existing stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It now has two stereocenters, at C3 and C5. Since the starting material was purely (5S), the products will be a mixture of (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers. To determine their relationship, we compare one to the mirror image of the other. The mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R). Since the second product is (3S, 5S), they are not mirror images.\n    *   Therefore, the two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral. It has no stereocenters.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃), has two stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are mirror images of each other, but they are superimposable due to an internal plane of symmetry. They are the same achiral compound, known as a **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore **cannot** be separated. They elute together as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different compounds (different molecular weights, formulas, and functionalities) and will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated. The two enantiomers will elute together. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   Enantiomers **can** be separated.\n*   Diastereomers **can** be separated.\n*   Again, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other and also separate the meso compound from both enantiomers. This gives **3 peaks** (one for each unique stereoisomer).\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH(OCH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's number the carbon chain to identify the positions: C6-C5(OCH₃)-C4-C3(=O)-C2-C1.\n    *   There is a pre-existing chiral center at C5 with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center, meaning its reduction will create a new chiral center.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form the final alcohol product.\n*   **Product(s):** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the two possible products will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced. The acidic workup provides the protons for the final alcohol groups.\n*   **Product(s):** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** For a molecule with two chiral centers (n=2), the maximum number of stereoisomers is 2ⁿ = 4. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses achiral reagents, this pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's examine the (2R, 4S) structure. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group. A molecule with chiral centers and a plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. It is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Summary of Products from Reaction II:** Reaction II produces three stereoisomers:\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of Product 3)\n    *   Product 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of Products 3 and 4)\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   It **separates** constitutional isomers (different connectivity).\n    *   It **separates** diastereomers (different physical properties, including polarity).\n    *   It **does NOT separate** enantiomers (identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** The final mixture contains five compounds in total before separation. Let's see how they behave on a normal-phase column.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** We have (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and will have different polarities. Thus, they will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** We have the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers have identical polarity and will co-elute, appearing as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity. It will appear as a separate, **1 peak**.\n        *   In total, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Combining Both Reactions:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, none of the peaks from Reaction I will overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to separate stereoisomers.\n    *   It **separates** constitutional isomers.\n    *   It **separates** diastereomers.\n    *   It **separates** enantiomers (by forming transient diastereomeric complexes with the CSP).\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** A chiral column has the ability to resolve all five unique stereoisomers produced, assuming no accidental overlap (which is a standard assumption in such problems).\n    *   **Compound 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Compound 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer of 1, will separate)\n    *   **Compound 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Compound 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer of 3, will separate on a chiral column)\n    *   **Compound 5:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Diastereomer of 3 & 4, will separate)\n*   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are constitutional isomers and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five stereoisomers are unique and can be distinguished by a chiral column, we expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks are observed.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere's the thinking process to solve this problem, broken down step-by-step.\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single, pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5, which is locked in the (S) configuration.\n    *   Reagents: Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to an alcohol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction converts the planar C=O group at carbon 3 into a new chiral center with a -OH group.\n    *   The original chiral center at carbon 5 is unaffected by this reaction; it remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the C3 carbonyl can occur from two different faces, creating both possible configurations (R and S) at the new chiral center.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Reagents: Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Because the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. We analyze the possible configurations: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        *   **(2R, 4R)** and **(2S, 4S)** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)** has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: the 2S, 4R configuration describes the same meso compound).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total mixture contains **five** unique stereoisomeric compounds. Let's analyze how they behave in the two different HPLC setups.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It **cannot** separate enantiomers, but it **can** separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated by an achiral column. They will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it has different physical properties and will elute as a separate, distinct **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase and is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n\n*   We simply need to count the total number of unique chemical compounds in the mixture.\n*   **From Reaction I:** There are 2 distinct diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction II:** There are 3 distinct stereoisomers (the two individual enantiomers and the one meso compound).\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n\nComparing this to the options:\n\nA) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n        *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n        *   This molecule has one stereocenter at the C5 position, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The stereocenter at C5 is not part of the reaction site and its configuration will remain (S).\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two molecules:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same (S), the other is different (R vs S)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. We can expect two distinct compounds to be formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n        *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n        *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   **Transformation:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced.\n    *   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We need to determine the possible stereoisomers.\n        *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n        *   Let's consider the (2R, 4S) structure. Because the molecule is symmetric around the central CH2 group, the (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (just flipped over).\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and the meso compound are diastereomers of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n    *   The final mixture contains all five stereoisomers produced: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n4.  **Analysis by Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral)**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).

Since the starting material is already chiral, this reaction will produce a pair of diastereomers. The incoming hydride from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, leading to two possible stereochemical outcomes at C3 (R or S), while the configuration at C5 remains (S).\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.

The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair, and the meso compound, being a diastereomer to the others, will also have a unique retention time. This results in **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 Peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nAn organic chemist performs two reactions.\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since there is a pre-existing stereocenter at C5, the hydride can attack the carbonyl from two different faces, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible products are (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) molecules are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R, 4S) compound has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral. Therefore, this reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Combined Products:**\nThe final mixture to be analyzed contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n**Analysis by HPLC:**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   The two products of Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) have identical polarities in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has a different polarity and will be separated, giving another **single peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally different with distinct polarities and will be separated from each other.\n*   In total, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **four peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase to separate chiral molecules, including both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I are both chiral and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other products from this reaction. It will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and elute as a **single, distinct peak**.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will separate all five stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   In total, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **five peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the products of each reaction and how they will behave in the different HPLC systems.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at the C5 position (S-configuration).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The incoming hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, leading to two possible stereoisomers at C3 (R or S). Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the products are diastereomers.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Result of Reaction I:** A mixture of two compounds that are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a standard reagent for reducing ketones to alcohols. Since it is used in excess, both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. There are three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (This is a *meso* compound, as it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral).\n*   **Result of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, which have different physical properties.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are **diastereomers**. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The **enantiomers** ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on a normal-phase column and will elute as a **single peak**.\n    *   The ***meso*** **compound** is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules with different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to separate enantiomers. It creates a chiral environment where enantiomers form temporary diastereomeric complexes with the CSP, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nAll five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct and will have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the others, will also elute as a distinct peak. Since all five compounds in the mixture are different stereoisomers, the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
