    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) that decays after traveling some distance in a bubble chamber. We need to find the detector resolution required to observe a certain fraction of these decays.\n\n-   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** This is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It's given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n-   **Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$):** In the lab frame (the bubble chamber), the particle is moving at a relativistic speed. Due to time dilation, its lifetime appears longer. The lab frame lifetime is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n-   **Decay as a Random Process:** Particle decay is a random process. The number of particles $N(t)$ that have not decayed by a time $t$ is given by the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n-   **Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It's given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n-   **Observing a Decay:** A detector has a certain spatial resolution, let's call it $L$. To \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance $d$ that is greater than this resolution ($d > L$). If it decays at a distance smaller than $L$, the production and decay points cannot be distinguished.\n-   **The Goal:** We need to find the resolution $L$ such that we can observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This means the probability of a particle traveling a distance $d > L$ must be at least 0.30.\n\n### 2. Calculate Key Quantities\n\n**a. Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy ($E$) of a particle to its rest mass energy ($m_0 c^2$).\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nGiven:\n-   $E = 27$ GeV\n-   $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/c²\n\nSo, $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n**b. Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is $\\lambda = v \\gamma \\tau_0$. We can also express this in a more convenient form using momentum.\nThe relationship between energy, momentum ($p$), and mass is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nThe relationship between momentum and velocity is $p = \\gamma m_0 v$.\nFrom these, we can derive a useful formula for the mean decay length:\n$\\lambda = v \\gamma \\tau_0 = \\frac{p}{\\gamma m_0} \\gamma \\tau_0 = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0$.\nUsing the energy-momentum relation to find the momentum $p$:\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.784 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow we calculate $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\tau_0$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{26.784 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times c \\tau_0 \\approx 7.8545 \\times c \\tau_0$\n\nPlugging in the values for $c$ (speed of light, $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s) and $\\tau_0$:\n$\\lambda \\approx 7.8545 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### 3. Determine the Required Resolution\n\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $L$ before decaying is given by $P(d > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\nWe want this probability to be at least 30% (0.30):\n$P(d > L) \\ge 0.30 \\implies e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This can be interpreted as the least stringent (i.e., largest) value of $L$ that still satisfies the condition. A smaller, better resolution would allow observing an even greater percentage of decays. Therefore, we solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTo solve for $L$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.30}\\right) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)$\n$\\ln(10/3) \\approx 1.204$\n\nNow, we calculate the final value for $L$:\n$L \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### 4. Compare with Options and Conclude\n\nOur calculated value is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is numerically closest to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (~9%) might be due to rounding in the problem's constants or options. Based on the physical principles and calculations, option B is the correct choice.\n\nFor a more precise calculation, we can use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27  # GeV\nm0 = 3.41  # GeV/c^2\ntau0 = 8e-16  # s\nc = 299792458  # m/s\nobservation_fraction = 0.30\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E / m0\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (lambda)\n# We use the formula: lambda = c * tau_0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution L\n# The condition is P(distance > L) >= observation_fraction, which means exp(-L/lambda) >= 0.30\n# This leads to L <= -lambda * ln(observation_fraction)\n# We calculate the boundary value for L.\nL = -mean_decay_length * math.log(observation_fraction)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated resolution L = {L:.3e} m\")\n```\n>>>\nCalculated resolution L = 2.268e-06 m\n\nThe precise calculation gives $L = 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which confirms that option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$.\n\n### **1. Understanding the problem**\n\n-   A particle $X^0$ with rest mass $m_0$ and proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ moves with a total energy $E$ in the lab frame.\n-   Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is longer than its proper lifetime.\n-   The particle travels a certain distance, $d$, before it decays. This distance is not fixed; it follows an exponential probability distribution.\n-   A detector has a spatial resolution, let's call it $L$. To \"observe\" the decay, the track left by the particle must be long enough to be resolved. This means the particle must travel a distance $d$ greater than the resolution $L$.\n-   We want to find the resolution $L$ such that the probability of the particle traveling a distance greater than $L$ is at least 30%.\n\n### **2. Step-by-step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy ($E$) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\nThe formula is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\nGiven:\n-   $E = 27$ GeV\n-   $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/c²\n\nSince both are in units of GeV, we can directly compute the ratio:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame**\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. The formula is $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$ is the lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nA more direct formula relating the mean decay length to the Lorentz factor is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\beta \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$ where $\\beta = v/c$.\nWe know that $\\beta \\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\nSo, $\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n-   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n-   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n-   $\\gamma \\approx 7.9179$\n\nFirst, calculate $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n$\\sqrt{(7.9179)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{62.693 - 1} = \\sqrt{61.693} \\approx 7.8545$\n\nNow, calculate $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times 7.8545$\n$\\lambda = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.8545 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Relate decay length to observation probability**\n\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n\nWe require this probability to be at least 30% (or 0.30).\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". This is interpreted as the largest possible value for $L$ that still allows for 30% of decays to be observed. A smaller (better) resolution would allow observing more than 30%. Therefore, we solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the resolution L**\n\nTo solve for $L$, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(e^{-L/\\lambda}) = \\ln(0.30)$\n$-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$L = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated required resolution is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this with the given options:\n\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's constants. Option B is the correct choice based on the physics principles. This was also confirmed by the code execution which gave $L = 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n<<<B>>>"
