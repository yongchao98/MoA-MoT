    "*   **Analyze the Core Concept:** The question is about \"regularization at high energies.\" This is a procedure used in physics, particularly in quantum field theory (QFT), to handle infinities that appear in calculations. These infinities typically arise from integrals over virtual particle loops where the momentum (and thus energy) can go to infinity. This is often called an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence.\" The question asks which of the listed theories does *not* need this procedure.\n\n*   **Evaluate Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):**\n    *   Both QED (the theory of electromagnetic interactions) and QCD (the theory of strong nuclear interactions) are quantum field theories built on the idea of point-like fundamental particles.\n    *   When calculating interactions, especially those involving closed loops of virtual particles, these theories produce divergent, infinite results.\n    *   To extract meaningful, finite physical predictions, physicists must employ a two-step process: 1) **Regularization**, which involves temporarily modifying the theory (e.g., by introducing an energy cutoff) to make the integrals finite, and 2) **Renormalization**, where these infinities are systematically absorbed into the redefinition of physical parameters like mass and charge.\n    *   Therefore, both QED and QCD **require** regularization. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n*   **Evaluate Classical Electrodynamics:**\n    *   This is the classical theory of electricity and magnetism described by Maxwell's equations. While it is not a quantum theory, it has its own version of a high-energy/short-distance infinity problem.\n    *   If you consider an electron to be a true point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (the self-energy) is infinite. This is because the field energy density is proportional to E², and for a point charge, the electric field E is proportional to 1/r². Integrating the energy density over all space results in a divergence as the radius `r` approaches zero.\n    *   This problem is a classical analogue of the UV divergences in QFT. To handle it, one might try to \"regularize\" the theory by assuming the electron has a small but finite radius, but this introduces other theoretical problems.\n    *   Thus, Classical Electrodynamics also encounters an infinity at high energies (short distances) and can be said to require a form of regularization. This eliminates option C.\n\n*   **Evaluate Superstring Theory:**\n    *   Superstring Theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. Its core postulate is that the fundamental constituents of the universe are not point particles, but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating \"strings.\"\n    *   A primary motivation and celebrated feature of Superstring Theory is that it is believed to be \"UV finite.\" The interactions between strings are not localized at a single point in spacetime. Instead, they are \"smeared out\" due to the extended nature of the strings. This smearing effect effectively smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to infinities in point-particle theories.\n    *   Because the theory is constructed in a way that avoids these high-energy divergences from the outset, it does not require the ad-hoc procedure of regularization. This makes it a compelling candidate for a fundamental theory.\n    *   Therefore, Superstring Theory is the theory on this list that never requires regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
