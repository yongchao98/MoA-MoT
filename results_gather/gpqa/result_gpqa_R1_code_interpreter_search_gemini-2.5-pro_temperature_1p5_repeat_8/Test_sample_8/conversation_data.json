    "1.  **Analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine its point group.**\n\n    *   **Quinuclidine (A):** The IUPAC name is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The molecule has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a methine (CH) group at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   There is a principal C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead carbon atom.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene bridges.\n        *   The molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   The absence of C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and the presence of the C3 axis and σv planes assign this molecule to the **C3v** point group.\n\n    *   **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (B):** This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. Let's find its structure. A search reveals this molecule is known as Substituted Hexaoxotriphenylene, or HATNA-mel. The core is a triphenylene, and three furan-dione rings are fused to it, maintaining the overall D3h symmetry of triphenylene if we consider the arrangement of the furan rings. However, the furan rings themselves break this symmetry. Let's look closer.\n        *   The molecule is likely planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the central ring.\n        *   It does not appear to have C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the anhydride groups (furan-dione) are not symmetrical with respect to reflection through the plane of the central benzene ring; the oxygen atoms are not symmetrically placed. For instance, the furan oxygens are on one side of the fused bond, and the carbonyl groups are on the other.\n        *   It also lacks vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Therefore, the only symmetry element, besides identity (E), is the C3 axis. The point group is **C3**.\n\n    *   **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C):** This molecule is a mellitic anhydride derivative, also known as Benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride.\n        *   The molecule is planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   There is a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   There are no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane defines the **C3h** point group. The other symmetry element implied by these two is an S3 improper rotation axis, which is coincident with the C3 axis.\n\n    *   **Triisopropyl borate (D):** The chemical formula is B(O-i-Pr)3. The structure consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups, B(OCH(CH3)2)3.\n        *   The core B(O)3 part is planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n        *   However, the isopropyl groups, -CH(CH3)2, are not planar and introduce chirality at the CH carbon.\n        *   Due to steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups will twist out of the B(O)3 plane in a propeller-like fashion to minimize repulsion. This conformation destroys any mirror planes (both σh and σv).\n        *   The resulting stable conformation possesses a C3 axis but no other symmetry elements (besides identity). Thus, its point group is **C3**.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   Quinuclidine: C3v\n    *   Triphenyleno[...]: C3\n    *   Benzo[...]trifuran-hexaone: **C3h**\n    *   Triisopropyl borate: C3\n\nThe molecule with C3h symmetry is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
