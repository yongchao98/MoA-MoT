    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and Volume:**\n    *   The vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially. In vector form using spherical coordinates, this is `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume of integration, `V`, is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   The goal is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field `f`. The integral is `∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n    *   This problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface bounding the volume.\n    *   The theorem states: `∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∬_S (f ⋅ dS)`, where `S` is the surface that encloses the volume `V`.\n    *   In this case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Address the Singularity:**\n    *   The vector field `f = r̂ / r^2` is undefined (singular) at the origin (`r = 0`). The Divergence Theorem, in its strict form, requires the vector field to be continuously differentiable throughout the volume.\n    *   However, the theorem can still be applied to find the value of the integral. The physical interpretation (related to Gauss's Law in electromagnetism) is that the flux through the enclosing surface measures the total \"source\" or \"charge\" inside, even if that source is a point-like singularity. Therefore, we can find the value of the volume integral by calculating the flux integral `∬_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Flux Integral `∬_S (f ⋅ dS)`:**\n    *   **Surface `S`:** The surface is a sphere of constant radius `r = R`.\n    *   **Field on the Surface `f(S)`:** On the surface of the sphere, the vector field is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` points radially outward. Its vector form is `dS = (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂`. Here, `θ` is the polar angle (from 0 to π) and `φ` is the azimuthal angle (from 0 to 2π).\n    *   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element.\n        `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n        The `R^2` terms cancel. Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n        `f ⋅ dS = sinθ dθ dφ`\n    *   **Integrate over the Surface:** Now, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere.\n        `Flux = ∬_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ dφ`\n\n        First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to π) sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]` (from 0 to π)\n        `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n        Next, integrate the result with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]` (from 0 to 2π)\n        `= 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The flux of the field `f` through the surface of the sphere of radius `R` is `4π`.\n    *   By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of `f` inside the sphere.\n    *   `∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R`, which is expected as the source of the divergence is concentrated at the origin.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated answer is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
