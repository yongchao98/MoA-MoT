    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the given quantum mechanical system.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \\frac{3}{2}kr^2\\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often advantageous to work in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ if the potential simplifies. The relationship between polar and Cartesian coordinates is:\n    $x = r\\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n2.  **Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n    We can substitute the Cartesian relations into the potential expression:\n    The first term is $\\frac{1}{2}kr^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2)$.\n    The second term involves $r^2\\cos^2(\\theta) = (r\\cos(\\theta))^2 = x^2$. So, the second term is $\\frac{3}{2}kx^2$.\n\n    Now, sum the terms to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2}kx^2$\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 + \\frac{3}{2}kx^2$\n    Combine the terms with $x^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2})kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{4}{2}kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n\n3.  **Separate the Hamiltonian**\n    The potential is now in a separated form, $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where:\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n    $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n\n    This means the two-dimensional system is equivalent to two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The total Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of the Hamiltonians for each direction, $H = H_x + H_y$, and the total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies from each oscillator, $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Eigenvalues for Each Oscillator**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2q^2$ are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        The potential is $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$. We set this equal to the general form $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2x^2$:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2 = 2k \\implies m\\omega_x^2 = 4k \\implies \\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m}$\n        The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n        $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$. We set this equal to the general form $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2y^2$:\n        $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k \\implies m\\omega_y^2 = k \\implies \\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$\n        The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n        $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n    The total energy $E$ is the sum of $E_{n_x}$ and $E_{n_y}$:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    Let's factor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = \\left[ (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot 2 + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)\\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    B) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Our result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
