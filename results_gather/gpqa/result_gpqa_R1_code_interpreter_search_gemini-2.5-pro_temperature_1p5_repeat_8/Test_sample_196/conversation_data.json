    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad peak from **3400–2500 cm-1** is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   A strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm-1** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Peaks at **1610 cm-1** and **1450 cm-1** are typical for C=C stretches within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet is in the typical range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is meta to it.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Now, let's piece together the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is consistent with the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and also adjacent to another group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H is the methine group (-CH-). Its chemical shift indicates it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:**\n            *   The methine (-CH-) is attached to the ring.\n            *   This methine is also attached to a methyl group (the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n            *   The methine is also attached to the methylene group (the 1.7 ppm multiplet).\n            *   The methylene group is attached to the other methyl group (the 0.9 ppm triplet).\n            *   This structure is -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), which is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Putting it all together, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option A, which is the starting material.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3). It will also reduce ketones and aldehydes to alkanes, but it does not affect simple alkyl groups or aromatic rings.\n    *   **Applying the reaction to Compound X:**\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 is an alkane group and will remain unchanged.\n        *   The product will be a benzene ring substituted with a methyl group and a sec-butyl group at positions 1 and 4, respectively.\n        *   The name of the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect isomer of the butyl group.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our derived product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
