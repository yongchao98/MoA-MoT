    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which contains 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows no signals for -CH2 groups. This is a critical piece of information that helps eliminate many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. If these 4 protons give only two signals, it strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (R1-C6H4-R2), the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, leading to two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a C=C double bond with two hydrogens. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Ha) is coupled to only one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. This means the other proton (Hb) is coupled to two sets of protons: one proton (the doublet part, from Ha) and a group of three equivalent protons (the quartet part). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern perfectly describes a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**) we just identified.\n        *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups allowed, this ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or anything larger. It must be either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3)**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n\n    Let's assemble the identified fragments:\n    *   Fragment 1: A para-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**)\n    *   Fragment 2: A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3, which has a formula of **C3H5**)\n    *   Fragment 3: An ester group containing a methyl group.\n        *   Case A: A methyl ester group (-COOCH3, which has a formula of **C2H3O2**)\n        *   Case B: An acetoxy group (-O-CO-CH3, which has a formula of **C2H3O2**)\n\n    Both possible ester groups have the same atomic composition. Now, let's sum the atoms from all fragments to find the molecular formula:\n\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   From the structure: Benzene ring (4 DoU) + C=C double bond (1 DoU) + C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the candidate formula C11H12O2 using the formula DoU = C + 1 - H/2:\n        *   DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming our structural analysis.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **A) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6. While the DoU is correct, this formula has an extra CH2 compared to our derived formula (C11H12O2). Adding a CH2 group would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR, which is explicitly absent.\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. This DoU is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. This DoU is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
