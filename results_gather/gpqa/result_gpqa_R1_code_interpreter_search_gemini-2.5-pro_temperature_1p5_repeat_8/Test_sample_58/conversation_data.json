    "This problem requires us to find the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The key is to perform stoichiometric calculations for the neutralization reactions that occur.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates completely, yielding two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will react preferentially and completely with the strong acid (H+), and then any remaining base will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available for this reaction = 0.100 mol\n    *   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the final solution contains:\n*   Excess OH- (a strong base) = 0.050 mol\n*   CH3COO- (acetate, a weak base) = 0.050 mol (formed from the reaction)\n*   Spectator ions (Cl-, Ba2+)\n\nThe pH of the final solution will be dominated by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-). The contribution of the weak base (CH3COO-) to the overall [OH-] is negligible due to the common ion effect from the excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   V_total = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
