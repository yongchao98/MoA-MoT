    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n    1.  The presence of one or more chiral centers (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    2.  The presence of axial or planar chirality, which arises from restricted rotation about a bond or a rigid planar structure.\n    A key test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i) in the molecule.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6'), free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered.\n    *   In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n    *   This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule is locked into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation, is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This compound is also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group. It also has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on the original.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It has a **center of inversion** (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you take any atom, move it in a straight line to this center point, and continue the same distance beyond, you will find an identical atom.\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
