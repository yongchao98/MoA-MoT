    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of a quantum state to its lifetime (Δt).\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: The relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical purposes in this context, we can approximate this as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    Here, the lifetime of the state (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the energy uncertainty, or the \"energy width\" of a state, is inversely proportional to its lifetime:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: We need to find the energy uncertainty for both states. We will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in electronvolt-seconds (eV·s) since the options are in eV.\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For State 1**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution**: To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy separation must be at least as large as their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂). This larger width is the limiting factor for resolution. The energy difference between the two levels, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the energy width of the broader level. A more conservative criterion is that the separation should be greater than the sum of their widths, but comparing it to the largest width is a good minimum condition.\n    *   Resolution condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    *   So, we need |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**: Now we compare this required minimum energy difference with the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\n    We check which of these options satisfies the condition |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (This works)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (Does not work)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (Does not work)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (Does not work)\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is significantly larger than the natural energy broadening of the levels.\n\n<<<A>>>"
