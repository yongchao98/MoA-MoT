    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Structure: It is a cyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n        *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   These α-carbons are part of double bonds and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Since there are **no α-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: It is a cyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n        *   The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all α-carbons to the carbonyl groups.\n        *   Each of these α-carbons has **two α-hydrogens**.\n        *   The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It can tautomerize to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is a stable aromatic compound. The formation of the stable aromatic ring is a strong driving force for this tautomerism.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** exhibit tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n        *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n        *   The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it **will show optical isomerism** (it has two enantiomers, R and S).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Structure: It is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n        *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, which makes the central part of the molecule planar.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are **no chiral centers**.\n        *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the C=C bond).\n        *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Thus, dimethyl fumarate **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
