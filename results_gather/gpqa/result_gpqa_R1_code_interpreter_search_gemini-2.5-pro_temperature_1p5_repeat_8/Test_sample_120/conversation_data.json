    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` core structure indicates a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) fused with a three-membered ring (cyclopropane).\n    *   The `7-oxa` prefix means the atom at position 7 is an oxygen, which, combined with the [4.1.0] bridge, indicates an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring at positions C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent.\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. This reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism.\n\n### 2. Apply the Rules of Regioselectivity and Stereoselectivity\n\nThe problem provides two key rules for this reaction:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   From the name, we know C1 has a methyl group attached (`1,3,4-trimethyl...`).\n    *   C6 does not have a methyl group (only a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`) from the Gilman reagent will attack C6.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n    *   This is a characteristic feature of an S_N2 reaction, where the nucleophile attacks from the backside of the leaving group (in this case, the epoxide oxygen).\n    *   The attack occurs at C6.\n    *   The initial configuration of C6 is given as (S).\n    *   Due to the inversion of configuration, the stereocenter at this carbon in the product will become (R).\n\n### 3. Predict the Product's Structure and Constitution\n\n*   The `Me⁻` nucleophile attacks C6, and the C6-O bond breaks.\n*   The electrons from the C-O bond move to the oxygen, forming an alkoxide at C1.\n*   A subsequent acidic or aqueous workup (a standard, implicit step in such reactions) protonates the alkoxide, yielding a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n*   A new methyl group from the reagent is now attached to C6.\n*   The product is therefore a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl groups.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product's IUPAC Name and Stereochemistry\n\n*   **Constitution and Numbering:**\n    *   The main functional group is the hydroxyl group, so the carbon it is attached to (the original C1) becomes **C1** in the product's IUPAC name.\n    *   The ring must be numbered to give the substituents (the methyl groups) the lowest possible locants.\n    *   There are methyl groups at:\n        *   The new C1 (from the original C1).\n        *   The carbon where attack occurred (the original C6).\n        *   The original C3.\n        *   The original C4.\n    *   If we number the ring starting from C1 (with the -OH) and going towards the original C6, the methyl locants will be 1, 2, 4, and 5. (i.e., new C1, new C2 is old C6, new C4 is old C4, new C5 is old C3). This gives the set {1, 2, 4, 5}. Numbering in the other direction would give {1, 3, 4, 6}, which is a higher set.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1 (product):** This carbon (originally C1) was not the site of nucleophilic attack. Its stereochemistry is retained. It was (R) and remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **C2 (product):** This carbon (originally C6) was the site of nucleophilic attack. Its stereochemistry is inverted. It was (S) and becomes **(2R)**.\n    *   **C4 (product):** This carbon (originally C4) was not involved in the reaction. Its stereochemistry is retained. It was (R) and remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **C5 (product):** This carbon (originally C3) was not involved in the reaction. Its stereochemistry is retained. It was (R) and remains **(5R)**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining all the parts, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 5. Match with Options\n\nComparing the derived product name with the given options:\n\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur predicted product exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
