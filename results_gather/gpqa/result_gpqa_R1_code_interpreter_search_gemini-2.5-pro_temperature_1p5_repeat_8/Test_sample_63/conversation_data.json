    "Here's my thinking process to solve this chemistry problem:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\nFirst, I'll break down the information provided and figure out what each piece of data means chemically.\n\n*   **Initial state:** An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. \"Equimolar\" means they are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. Total mass is 7.20 g.\n*   **Process:** The mixture is heated to 200°C. It decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. No solids are left.\n*   **Gas Analysis Train:** The resulting gas mixture is passed through three sequential setups.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent. Its weight increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight did not change, which is a critical clue: **The gas mixture contains no acidic gases.**\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂) or nitrogen oxides (like N₂O, NO). The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increases by 0.80 g. This weight increase is precisely the mass of the oxygen atoms that have chemically bonded to the copper.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O is 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This oxygen must have come from a gas. If the gas was O₂, the moles of O₂ would be 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol. If the gas was N₂O, the moles of N₂O would be 0.05 mol.\n\n    *   **Final Gas (Gas C):** After all these reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to all the previous reagents (H₂O absorber, base, hot Cu). The most likely candidate from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nSince the salts completely decompose into gases, we can find the elemental makeup of the original 7.20 g mixture by summing up the elements in the product gases. The elements present are H, O, and N.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with Cu.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** This is the trickiest part. Nitrogen is in Gas C (assumed N₂) and potentially in the gas that reacted with Cu (e.g., N₂O). Let's test two plausible scenarios for the gas reacting with Cu.\n\n    *   **Scenario A: The gas was O₂.** The final gas C (0.10 mol) would be N₂ produced directly from the decomposition.\n        *   Total N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Scenario B: The gas was N₂O.** This would account for the 0.05 mol of O atoms. The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction would produce 0.05 mol of N₂. The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is made of this 0.05 mol plus another 0.05 mol of N₂ that was produced in the initial decomposition and passed through unreacted.\n        *   Total N atoms = 2 × (moles of N₂O) + 2 × (moles of original N₂) = 2 × 0.05 + 2 × 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   Both scenarios lead to the same total amount of Nitrogen: **0.20 mol of N atoms.**\n\n*   **Summary of Elements:** The 7.20 g mixture contains:\n    *   0.40 mol H\n    *   0.20 mol N\n    *   0.25 mol O\n*   Let's check the mass: (0.40 mol × 1 g/mol) + (0.20 mol × 14 g/mol) + (0.25 mol × 16 g/mol) = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g. This matches perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B containing only N, H, and O. They are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n*   Let's say we have `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B.\n*   The total chemical formula of the mixture is `x*A + x*B`.\n*   The total moles of atoms are: N = 0.20, H = 0.40, O = 0.25.\n*   The ratio of moles of atoms is H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25, which simplifies to 8:4:5.\n*   Therefore, the combined formula of (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince A and B are salts, we look for a cation and anion. The H:N ratio of 8:4 (or 2:1) is characteristic of ammonium (NH₄⁺) compounds. The formula N₄H₈ suggests two NH₄⁺ groups and two other nitrogen atoms in anions.\n*   Let's try to split N₄H₈O₅ into two equimolar salt formulas, A and B.\n*   A + B = N₄H₈O₅\n*   The most common ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Let's check their formulas:\n    *   A = NH₄NO₃ has the formula N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   B = NH₄NO₂ has the formula N₂H₄O₂.\n*   Adding them together: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match.\n\nTo be absolutely sure, let's verify everything with the mole quantities. From the elemental analysis, we found the ratio H:N:O = 8:4:5. And the total moles of N were 0.2. This means the formula unit (N₄H₈O₅) corresponds to 0.20 / 4 = 0.05 units.\nSo, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of A (NH₄NO₃) and 0.05 mol of B (NH₄NO₂). This value of `x=0.05` is consistent with all our initial calculations.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe calculation is confirmed to be consistent and logical. I will now run a Python script to double-check all the numerical values.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nM_H = 1.008  # Molar mass of Hydrogen\nM_N = 14.007 # Molar mass of Nitrogen\nM_O = 16.00   # Molar mass of Oxygen\n\n# Given data from the problem\nmass_mixture = 7.20 # grams\ndelta_m_tube1_h2o = 3.60 # grams\ndelta_m_tube3_o = 0.80 # grams\nvol_gas_C_stp = 2.24 # Liters\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of products from experimental data\nM_H2O = 2 * M_H + M_O\nmoles_H2O = delta_m_tube1_h2o / M_H2O\nmoles_O_atoms_tube3 = delta_m_tube3_o / M_O\nmoles_gas_C = vol_gas_C_stp / 22.4\n\n# Step 2: Test the hypothesis that salts are NH4NO3 and NH4NO2\n# Let x be the moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n# Decomposition can be written as:\n# x NH4NO2 -> x N2 + 2x H2O\n# x NH4NO3 -> x N2O + 2x H2O\n# Products passed to tubes: Total H2O = 4x; Total N2O = x; Total N2 = x.\n# Tube 1 absorbs H2O. Mass = 4x * M_H2O. From this, x = (3.60 / M_H2O) / 4 = ~0.05\n# Tube 3 reacts with N2O. Mass increase is from oxygen. Mass_O = x * M_O. From this, x = 0.80 / M_O = 0.05\n# Gas C is total Nitrogen. Initial N2 (x) + N2 from N2O (x) = 2x. From this, x = (2.24/22.4)/2 = 0.05.\n# All data point consistently to x = 0.05 mol.\nx = 0.05\n\n# Step 3: Verify the total mass of the initial mixture\nM_NH4NO3 = 2 * M_N + 4 * M_H + 3 * M_O\nM_NH4NO2 = 2 * M_N + 4 * M_H + 2 * M_O\ncalculated_mass = x * M_NH4NO3 + x * M_NH4NO2\nprint(f\"Calculated mass of the mixture: {calculated_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Given mass of the mixture: {mass_mixture:.2f} g\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms per formula unit\natoms_A_NH4NO3 = 2 + 4 + 3\natoms_B_NH4NO2 = 2 + 4 + 2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A_NH4NO3 + atoms_B_NH4NO2\n\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n>>>\nCalculated mass of the mixture: 7.21 g\nGiven mass of the mixture: 7.20 g\nTotal number of atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B: 17\n\nThe code confirms that all calculations are correct and the identification of the salts is consistent with all the data provided. The slight difference in mass (7.21 g vs 7.20 g) is due to rounding of molar masses and is negligible. The final step is to report the answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical decomposition and subsequent reactions of the resulting gases.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant (drying agent). The weight increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O formed = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which turns cloudy in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change means **no acidic gases were produced** in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms that reacted = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas. Given that the salts contain nitrogen, a likely candidate is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction would be N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This would mean 0.05 mol of N₂O was in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, C, has a volume of 2.24 L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the previous reagents. The most plausible gas from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Products of Decomposition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gaseous products of the decomposition were:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O (which was consumed in tube №3)\n*   An amount of N₂ that, combined with the N₂ from the N₂O reaction, totals 0.10 mol.\n\nThe reaction in tube №3 (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) shows that 0.05 mol of N₂O produces 0.05 mol of N₂. Since the total final N₂ is 0.10 mol, another 0.05 mol of N₂ must have been produced directly during the initial heating.\nSo, the initial gaseous products were:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we started with an equimolar mixture (e.g., `x` moles of A and `x` moles of B). We need to find two salts whose decomposition in a 1:1 molar ratio produces the gases calculated above.\n\nConsider the decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (when heated to ~200-250°C)\n\nLet's assume A is NH₄NO₃ and B is NH₄NO₂. If we had 0.05 mol of each:\n*   0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 mol N₂O + (0.05 * 2) mol H₂O = 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ → 0.05 mol N₂ + (0.05 * 2) mol H₂O = 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products:\n*   N₂O: 0.05 mol\n*   N₂: 0.05 mol\n*   H₂O: 0.10 mol + 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol\n\nThese product amounts perfectly match what we deduced from the experimental data.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ equals the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4(1)+14+3(16) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4(1)+14+2(16) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\nThis confirms the identities and amounts of salts A and B.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
