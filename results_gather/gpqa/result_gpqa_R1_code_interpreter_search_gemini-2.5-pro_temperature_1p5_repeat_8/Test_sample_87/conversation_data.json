    "*   **Analysis of the experimental setup and observations:**\n    1.  **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally to mice.\n    2.  **Antigen Trafficking:** The antigen successfully reaches the Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The fluorescence in Peyer's patches confirms this.\n    3.  **Immune Cell Activation:** In the Peyer's patches, a cell population is proliferating. This is a classic sign of lymphocyte (B cell or T cell) activation upon encountering their specific antigen. Since the variable heavy chain gene is being analyzed, we are focused on B cells.\n    4.  **Genetic Change:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene from this proliferating population shows \"high variability.\" This means that among the B cells that are dividing in response to the rotavirus protein, there are many different, newly generated DNA sequences in the part of the gene that codes for the antigen-binding site.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the possible processes:**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial B cell receptor (and antibody) diversity. It happens in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The process described in the question is happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen encounter in a mature B cell population. Therefore, VDJ recombination is not the correct process.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating within specialized structures called germinal centers, which are found in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. SHM introduces random point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This generates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and differentiate, a process called affinity maturation. The \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population is the direct result of somatic hypermutation. This perfectly matches the experimental observations.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG) and thus its effector function, but it does not alter the antigen-binding site or contribute to the variability of the variable region itself. The question specifically states variability was found in the *variable heavy chain gene*.\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes in B cells.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells isolated from Peyer's patches following antigen exposure is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
