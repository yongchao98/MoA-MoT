    "Annihilation is a process where a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide and their mass is converted into energy, often in the form of other particles. In this problem, a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilate to produce four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible. Therefore, the initial energy is dominated by the rest energy of the proton and the antiproton.\n    The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is approximately $938.27$ MeV/cÂ². The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). All these particles have the same mass $m_A$. The final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of these four particles.\n    Let the relativistic energy of one A particle be $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    Since there are four identical particles, the total final energy is:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    We are given that $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**3. Solve for the Velocity (v)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the velocity $v$ by the equation:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nTo find $v$, we rearrange the equation:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n**4. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial proton and antiproton system is approximately at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This is achieved if the four product particles fly off in different directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero. The calculation for the magnitude of the velocity of each particle, as done above using energy conservation, remains valid.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity $0.77c$ matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
