    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by H₃O⁺**\n\nThis reaction sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the starting alkene. We need to determine the stereochemistry of the product, octane-4,5-diol.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** The two-step process of epoxidation with mCPBA (a *syn*-addition) followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening (an S_N2-like *anti*-attack) results in an overall *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions is **\"TAM\"**, which stands for **T**rans-**A**nti-**M**eso. This means that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound is an achiral molecule that contains chiral centers. For octane-4,5-diol, the meso form is (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral product.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, followed by H₃O⁺**\n\nThis is also an anti-dihydroxylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is also an *anti*-addition of two -OH groups.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The mnemonic for this case is **\"CAR\"**, which stands for **C**is-**A**nti-**R**acemic. This means that the anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture.\n    *   A racemic mixture consists of a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. For octane-4,5-diol, the enantiomers are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This constitutes two different chemical compounds.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (the meso isomer) is a **diastereomer** of compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus can be separated on a standard achiral column.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   **Observation:**\n    *   The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair because it is a diastereomer. This gives **Peak 1**.\n    *   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are enantiomers and will co-elute, giving **Peak 2**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n*   A chiral column can separate enantiomers because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Observation:**\n    *   The meso-diol is a unique compound and will elute as **Peak 1**.\n    *   The (4R,5R)-diol will interact differently with the chiral phase than its enantiomer and will elute as **Peak 2**.\n    *   The (4S,5S)-diol will elute at a different time from both the meso compound and its enantiomer, giving **Peak 3**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
