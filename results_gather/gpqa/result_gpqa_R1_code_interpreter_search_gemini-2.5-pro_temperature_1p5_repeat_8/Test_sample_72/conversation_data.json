    "This is a problem of special relativity. I need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculating the relative speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for the relativistic velocity subtraction is given by:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nwhere:\n*   v1 = 0.6c (speed of the first astronaut)\n*   v2 = 0.5c (speed of the second astronaut)\n*   c is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\nSo, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**2.
