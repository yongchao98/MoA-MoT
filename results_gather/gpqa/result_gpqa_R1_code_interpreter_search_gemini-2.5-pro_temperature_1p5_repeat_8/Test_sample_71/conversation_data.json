    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of final product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on it.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the initial reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene molecule with a tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 bridge position. Norbornadiene has two double bonds and is an excellent dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule, upon reaction with sodium iodide (NaI), will serve as a precursor to a reactive diene.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of a vicinal bis(dibromomethyl) compound, `R-CHBr2-CHBr2-R'`, is not standard. However, a similar reaction for gem-dihalides `R2CBr2` with a reducing agent like NaI is elimination to form an alkene. A more common precursor for in-situ diene generation is an α,α,α',α'-tetrabromo-o-xylene, which generates an o-quinodimethane. Let's analyze the given reactant: `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The reaction with NaI involves reductive debromination. The most plausible product from the two `-CHBr2` groups on adjacent carbons (C5, C6) is the formation of two new exocyclic double bonds, creating **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**, a C8H8 isomer also known as [6]dendralene.\n*   This reactive diene ([6]dendralene) then participates in a Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornadiene derivative. Since 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction will occur, with one molecule of the diene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene.\n*   This yields **Product 1**, a large, symmetrical molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis of Product 1 to form Product 2.**\n\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a strong acid medium. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is an acid-labile protecting group for alcohols. The acid catalyzes the cleavage of the tert-butyl ether, yielding an alcohol (-OH) and isobutylene (or tert-butanol).\n*   **Product 2** is therefore the same as Product 1, but with the -OtBu group at C7 replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of Product 2 to form Product 3.**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with the sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This is known as the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively.\n*   The secondary alcohol at C7 in Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone (a carbonyl group, C=O).\n*   **Product 3** is the corresponding ketone, with a C=O group at the C7 bridge position.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal decomposition of Product 3 to form Product 4.**\n\n*   Product 3 is heated to 150°C. Product 3 was formed via two Diels-Alder reactions. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, called a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, is favored at high temperatures.\n*   Heating Product 3 will induce two sequential retro-Diels-Alder reactions. This will regenerate the two molecules of the diene used in Step 1 (**5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**) and the central dienophile core.\n*   The dienophile core liberated is **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**, also known as norbornadienone.\n*   Norbornadienone is a highly unstable molecule. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination at or even below room temperature, a reaction favored by the formation of very stable products. It rapidly fragments into carbon monoxide (CO) and **benzene** (C₆H₆).\n*   So, the final mixture in the reaction vessel contains benzene, carbon monoxide, and the regenerated diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n**Step 5: Identify \"Product 4\" and determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens.**\n\n*   The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\". This implies we need to identify a single product molecule.\n*   We have two potential products: benzene and 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   If product 4 were benzene (C₆H₆), all six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's high symmetry (D₆h point group). This would give 1 signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum. However, \"1\" is not among the given options (A) 7, (B) 8, (C) 4, (D) 10.\n*   This strongly suggests that benzene is not the \"product 4\" the question is referring to. The likely intention is that \"product 4\" is the other major organic molecule formed, the regenerated diene. This is a common pattern in exam problems where a molecular scaffold (the norbornadiene part) is used and then removed to liberate the molecule of interest.\n*   Let's analyze the structure of **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule has the formula C₈H₈.\n    *   Let's consider its symmetry. The molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond. This means that several pairs of protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n             H(b)-C2=C3-H(b)\n                /   \\\n            H(a)-C1   C4-H(a)\n               \\\\ / \\ //\n                C6===C5\n               / \\ / \\\n            H(d)-C=C-H(d)\n                /   \\\n             H(c)   H(c)\n        ```\n        Let's correct this depiction for clarity and label the protons based on symmetry equivalence:\n        *   Ring protons: The protons on C1 and C4 are equivalent. Let's call them **Hₐ**. The protons on C2 and C3 are equivalent. Let's call them **Hₑ**.\n        *   Exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) protons: The methylene group on C5 is equivalent to the one on C6. Within each methylene group, the two protons are not equivalent. One is closer to the ring's double bonds (let's call it **H_c**), and one is further away (let's call it **H_d**). The two **H_c** protons are equivalent by symmetry, and the two **H_d** protons are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, we have four sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n        1.  Hₐ (on C1 and C4)\n        2.  Hₑ (on C2 and C3)\n        3.  H_c (the \"inner\" exocyclic protons)\n        4.  H_d (the \"outer\" exocyclic protons)\n*   This gives a total of **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms. This number matches option C.\n\nLet's use a code block to confirm this reasoning, although it is based on chemical principles of symmetry rather than computation.\n```python\n# The problem asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, which we have deduced to be 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n# We need to determine the number of non-equivalent protons in this molecule based on its symmetry.\n# The molecule has C2 symmetry. Let's analyze the proton environments.\n# H on C1 is equivalent to H on C4. (Signal 1)\n# H on C2 is equivalent to H on C3. (Signal 2)\n# The two exocyclic CH2 groups are equivalent.\n# Within each CH2 group, the two protons are diastereotopic. One is 'cis' to the C5-C4/C6-C1 bond, the other is 'trans'.\n# The two 'cis' protons are equivalent to each other by symmetry. (Signal 3)\n# The two 'trans' protons are equivalent to each other by symmetry. (Signal 4)\n# Total number of signals is 4.\nnum_signals = 4\nprint(f\"The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is {num_signals}.\")\n```\n\nFinal Answer is based on identifying Product 4 as 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, which has 4 distinct sets of protons due to its C₂ symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem. Let's break down each step to identify the structure of the final product, 4, and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene: This is a norbornadiene derivative that will act as a dienophile. It has two double bonds available for Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI): This reaction generates a reactive diene *in situ*. The reaction of vicinal tetrabromides (in this case, two gem-dibromides on adjacent carbons) with NaI is a standard method for reductive elimination to form double bonds. Here, the two -CHBr₂ groups are converted into two exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups. The diene generated is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**, also known as [6]dendralene.\n*   **Reaction:** The problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used. This implies a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, where one molecule of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene adds across each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative.\n*   **Product 1:** This is the large adduct from the two successive Diels-Alder reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄(aq)).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an acidic workup. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) is an acid-labile protecting group for an alcohol. In the presence of strong acid, it is cleaved to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group and isobutylene.\n*   **Product 2:** The same polycyclic structure as Product 1, but with the -OtBu group at the C7 bridge position replaced by an -OH group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** Sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃·py) in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation that converts secondary alcohols into ketones. The secondary alcohol at the C7 bridge position in Product 2 is oxidized.\n*   **Product 3:** The C7 bridge position is now a carbonyl group (C=O). Product 3 is a large polycyclic ketone.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Condition:** Heating at 150 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible. The reverse reaction, a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, is favored by heat. The two Diels-Alder adducts in Product 3 will fragment.\n*   This retro-Diels-Alder reaction regenerates the starting components: two molecules of the diene (**5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**) and the central dienophile fragment.\n*   The central fragment is **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**. This molecule is known to be highly unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction) to expel carbon monoxide (CO) and form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Identifying Product 4:** The final reaction mixture contains two major organic products: benzene and 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. We must determine which one is \"product 4\".\n    *   If Product 4 is benzene, all six of its hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent due to its high symmetry. This would result in 1 distinct hydrogen signal, which is not an option.\n    *   Therefore, \"Product 4\" must be the other major organic product, **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Analysis of the Number of Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds. This symmetry makes pairs of atoms equivalent.\n*   **Hydrogen Environments:** Let's count the non-equivalent protons:\n    1.  The protons on C1 and C4 are equivalent to each other due to the C₂ symmetry. (Set 1)\n    2.  The protons on C2 and C3 are equivalent to each other. (Set 2)\n    3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, within each methylene group, the two protons are not equivalent. One proton is closer to the ring (\"inner\") and one is further away (\"outer\"). They are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two \"inner\" protons are equivalent to each other by symmetry. (Set 3)\n    4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. (Set 4)\n\nTherefore, there are four sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
