    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with a symmetry axis (z-axis) can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation `λ`. This is the simplest and dominant form of radiation for such a configuration.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `K` is a constant that depends on the frequency, the amplitude of the dipole moment, and fundamental constants, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n    In the problem, this power per unit solid angle is denoted as the function `f(λ, θ)`.\n    So, `f(λ, θ) = K(λ) * sin²(θ)`.\n\n2.  **Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    The maximum power `A` is therefore:\n    `A = f_max = K(λ) * sin²(90°) = K(λ) * 1 = K(λ)`\n\n3.  **Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:**\n    We can now express the power at any angle `θ` in terms of the maximum power `A`:\n    `f(λ, θ) = A * sin²(θ)`\n\n    We need to find the power at `θ = 30°`, which is `f(λ, 30°)`, and then find the fraction it represents of `A`.\n    `f(λ, 30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    So, the power radiated at `30°` is `A/4`.\n    The fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the square of the acceleration of the charge. For sinusoidal oscillation with angular frequency `ω`, the acceleration is proportional to `ω²`, and the radiated power is proportional to `(acceleration)²`, which means the power is proportional to `(ω²)² = ω⁴`.\n    `P ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, has the same dependence:\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality:\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nCombining these two results, we get the answer `1/4` and `λ⁻⁴`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
