    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   The observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton (an alpha-proton) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n        *   The fact that spin-spin coupling is ruled out means the splitting is not due to neighboring protons.\n        *   The similar chemical shifts suggest the two environments are structurally similar.\n        *   The roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H) imply that the two species responsible for these environments are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n        *   This phenomenon, where slow conformational change on the NMR timescale leads to separate peaks for each conformer, is common.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   The presence of two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram confirms that there are two distinct chemical species in the mixture that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity).\n        *   The fact that both peaks show the *same mass spectrum* is a crucial piece of evidence. It proves that the two species are isomers â€“ they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but different structures.\n        *   The mass spectrum being \"consistent with the expected molecule\" rules out impurities with different formulas (like precursors or side-products with different masses).\n        *   The \"elevated temperature\" condition can sometimes be used to study interconversion, but here it simply confirms that the two isomers are stable enough to be separated chromatographically under these conditions.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Data:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added, resulting in a product with a higher molecular weight. The mass spectrum would be different from the expected molecule, which contradicts the LC-MS data. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n        *   **NMR Properties:** Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. They would be expected to have different NMR spectra. A proton in one diastereomer would be in a different chemical environment than the corresponding proton in the other, leading to two separate peaks. This fits the NMR data.\n        *   **LC-MS Properties:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can typically be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. Since they are isomers, they have the same mass. This perfectly matches the LC-MS data.\n        *   **Plausibility in Peptides:** There are two common ways to get diastereomers in a peptide context:\n            1.  **Epimerization:** A chiral center (the alpha-carbon) in one of the amino acid residues could have inverted during synthesis, creating a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., L-L-L and L-D-L peptides).\n            2.  **Atropisomerism (Cis/Trans Isomerism):** The peptide (amide) bond has significant double-bond character, restricting rotation. This leads to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are a specific type of diastereomer (also called rotamers or atropisomers). The interconversion between them is often slow on the NMR timescale, leading to separate sets of peaks. This phenomenon is especially common for amide bonds involving proline residues, where the *cis* and *trans* forms can have similar energies, leading to roughly equal populations (a 1:1 ratio).\n        *   Since *cis/trans* isomerism results in diastereomers and is a very common phenomenon in peptides, this option is a very strong candidate. It fully explains all the observations.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor molecule would have a different chemical structure and almost certainly a different molecular weight. This contradicts the LC-MS data showing both peaks have the same mass as the target compound. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR/LC Properties:** In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties. They would give a single peak in a standard 1H NMR spectrum and would co-elute as a single peak on a standard (achiral) LC column. To separate them, you would need a chiral NMR solvent or a chiral LC column. The observation of two distinct peaks in both NMR and LC under what are presumably standard conditions rules out enantiomers. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    The data points unequivocally to the presence of a mixture of two isomers that are not enantiomers. By definition, these must be diastereomers. The specific phenomenon causing this in a peptide is most likely the slow interconversion between *cis* and *trans* conformers around one of the amide bonds, which are themselves a form of diastereomers. Therefore, the statement that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers is the most accurate and comprehensive explanation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
