    "*   **1. Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. This energy decreases with the square of the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature, assuming the planet radiates as a blackbody, is:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a)^1/2\n    where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. For a circular orbit, 'a' is simply the orbital distance.\n\n    This means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) orbiting the same star is:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [(1/a_4)^1/2] / [(1/a_2)^1/2] = (a_2 / a_4)^1/2\n\n    Note: The problem states the albedos are the same, and since they orbit the same star, the star's properties (luminosity, radius, temperature) cancel out in the ratio, leaving only the dependency on orbital distance.\n\n*   **2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital distances is:\n    a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n*   **3. Combine the Equations**\n    Now we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [(P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)]^(1/2)\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n*   **4. Use the Given Period Ratios**\n    The problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\n*   **5. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n    Now, plug this value into our final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4\nP2_over_P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = P2_over_P4 ** (1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\nThe calculation gives approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the energy it receives from its host star. This energy decreases with the square of the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (\\frac{1-A}{a^2})^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n    where `A` is the albedo and `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    Since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo (`A`), these terms cancel out when we take a ratio. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_4^2)^{1/4}}{(1/a_2^2)^{1/4}} = (\\frac{a_2^2}{a_4^2})^{1/4} = (\\frac{a_2}{a_4})^{1/2}$\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital distances is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}$\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = ((\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3})^{1/2}$\n    By simplifying the exponents, we get:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:**\n    The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 is:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    Now, plug the period ratio into the final equation and calculate the result.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n    The calculation was performed in the previous step and yielded a result of approximately 0.8298.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated value of ~0.83 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
