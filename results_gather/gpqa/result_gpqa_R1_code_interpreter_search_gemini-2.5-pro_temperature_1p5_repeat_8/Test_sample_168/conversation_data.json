    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve this problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\nThe energy spectrum of a particle (or a system of particles) emitted in a decay depends on the number of particles in the final state.\n\n*   **Two-Body Decay:** If a decay results in only two particles in the final state (e.g., A -> B + C), the laws of conservation of energy and momentum completely determine the energies of the outgoing particles. In the rest frame of particle A, B and C will have fixed, discrete energies. This would result in a discrete spectrum (a sharp peak).\n\n*   **Multi-Body Decay (>2 particles):** If a decay results in three or more particles in the final state, the available energy (the Q-value) can be distributed among them in infinitely many ways, while still conserving energy and momentum. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for any of the decay products.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    The final state consists of (at least) three groups of particles that share the energy: the two heavy `B` nucleons, the two `E` particles, and the two `V` particles. Since there are more than two products, the energy can be shared continuously. The problem statement confirms this by stating the spectrum is continuous.\n\n*   **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    The final state consists of the `2B` nucleons, the `2E` particles, and the single particle `M`. Again, we have at least three bodies in the final state. Therefore, the energy distribution is not fixed, and the total energy spectrum of the `E` particles must remain **continuous**. The exact shape of the distribution will change because the phase space of the final state is different (one `M` particle instead of two `V` particles), but it remains continuous.\n\nThis analysis immediately eliminates options A and B, which state that the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Endpoint of the Spectrum\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum (`Q`) represents the maximum possible total kinetic energy that the two `E` particles can have. This maximum energy is fundamentally limited by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value.\n\nThe Q-value is determined by the change in rest mass from the initial state to the final state:\n`Q-value = (Mass_initial - Mass_final) * c^2`\n\nLet's calculate the Q-value for both decays:\n\n*   **Initial State Mass:** `Mass_initial = 2 * m_A`\n\n*   **Final State Mass (Original Decay):** `Mass_final_orig = 2 * m_B + 2 * m_E + 2 * m_V`\n\n*   **Q-value (Original Decay):** `Q_orig = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V)) * c^2`\n    The endpoint of the `E` spectrum, `Q_{endpoint}`, is approximately equal to this `Q_orig` (ignoring the small recoil energy of the heavy B nucleons).\n\n*   **Final State Mass (Variant Decay):** We are told the particle `M` is massless (`m_M = 0`).\n    `Mass_final_var = 2*m_B + 2*m_E + m_M = 2*m_B + 2*m_E`\n\n*   **Q-value (Variant Decay):** `Q_var = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E)) * c^2`\n\nNow, let's compare the Q-value of the variant decay to the original decay:\n`Q_var = (2*m_A - 2*m_B - 2*m_E) * c^2`\n`Q_orig = (2*m_A - 2*m_B - 2*m_E) * c^2 - 2*m_V * c^2`\n\nTherefore, `Q_var = Q_orig + 2*m_V * c^2`.\n\nThe particle `V` is a \"light particle,\" implying it has a real, physical existence and thus a rest mass `m_V`. In physics, particles have non-negative mass (`m_V â‰¥ 0`). The options provided (increase vs. decrease) imply that `m_V` is not zero. If it were, the endpoint wouldn't change, which is not an option. Thus, we must assume `m_V > 0`.\n\nSince `m_V > 0`, it follows that `2*m_V*c^2 > 0`, which means `Q_var > Q_orig`.\n\nThe total energy released in the variant decay is greater than in the original decay. This additional energy is available to be distributed among the kinetic energies of the final particles. Consequently, the maximum possible kinetic energy for the `E` particles must be higher in the variant decay.\n\nThe endpoint of the spectrum **increases**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous** because the variant decay still has a multi-body final state.\n2.  The endpoint of the spectrum **increases** because replacing two massive `V` particles with one massless `M` particle reduces the total rest mass of the final products, thus increasing the total energy released (Q-value).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
