    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can denote as `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `plx⁻⁵`.\n    Mathematically:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    where `dN` is the number of stars in an infinitesimally small parallax range `d(plx)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`. This means we need to find the number of stars per unit interval of distance, which is `dN/dr`. We want to see how `dN/dr` is related to `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    The fundamental relationship between astronomical distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) is that they are inversely proportional. For small angles (which is always the case for stellar parallax), the formula is:\n    `r = 1 / plx` or equivalently `plx = 1 / r`\n    (This assumes `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n4.  **Perform a Change of Variables:**\n    We have a relationship in terms of `plx` and we want to convert it to a relationship in terms of `r`. We can use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN / dr = (dN / d(plx)) * (d(plx) / dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`. We can differentiate this with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx) / dr = d(r⁻¹) / dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1 / r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Chain Rule Equation:**\n    Now we substitute the proportionalities and the derivative back into our chain rule formula:\n    `dN / dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n\n7.  **Express Everything in Terms of `r`:**\n    Our expression for `dN/dr` currently contains both `plx` and `r`. To get the final relationship, we need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (`plx = 1/r`).\n    `dN / dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the mathematical expression:\n    `(1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n    So, the proportionality becomes:\n    `dN / dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n    `dN / dr ∝ -r⁽⁵⁻²⁾`\n    `dN / dr ∝ -r³`\n\n9.  **Interpret the Final Result:**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` tells us how the number density changes with distance. The negative sign arises because distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) are inversely related (as `r` increases, `plx` decreases). The physical quantity, the number of stars per unit distance, must be positive. Therefore, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship.\n\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r³`.\n\n    `N(r) ~ r³`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
