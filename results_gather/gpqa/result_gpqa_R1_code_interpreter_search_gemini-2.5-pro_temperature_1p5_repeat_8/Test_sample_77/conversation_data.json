    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Problem:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key feature of this problem is that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`. Therefore, the field at an observation point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define Key Quantities:**\n    *   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n    *   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the \"field point\").\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time when the electromagnetic signal was emitted from the charge to reach the observer at `r` at time `t`. The time it takes for the signal to travel is `t - tr`. The distance it travels is `|r - s(tr)|`. Since the signal travels at the speed of light `c`, we have the relation:\n        `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n    *   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`.\n        `d = r - s(tr)`\n        The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n        So, the retarded time condition becomes `c(t - tr) = d`.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge, evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n        `v = d(s(t))/dt` at `t = tr`.\n\n3.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general expressions for retarded potentials by treating the charge as a delta function distribution. The standard results, after evaluating the necessary integrals, are:\n\n    *   Scalar Potential (V):\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    *   Vector Potential (A):\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    Note the relationship between them: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, since $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o \\mu_o)$.\n\n4.  **Manipulate the Expressions to Match the Options:** The options provided have a slightly different algebraic form in the denominator. Let's manipulate our standard formulas to see which option they match.\n\n    *   Focus on the denominator term: $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$\n    *   Find a common denominator: $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = \\frac{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Now substitute this back into the potential expressions:\n\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{\\dfrac{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right] = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    *   For the vector potential A:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\dfrac{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q c \\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions for both V and A.\n\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        This V is the static Coulomb potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge. The expression for A is also incorrect.\n\n    *   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        This V is also the static Coulomb potential. While the relationship between A and V is correct, the formula for V itself is wrong for a moving charge.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
