    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n1.  **Identify the reference frames.**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" (let's call it S) is the stationary frame.\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given variables.**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v`, is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), `Δt'`, is 50 seconds. This is the proper time.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal.**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the solution using physics principles.**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will observe time passing more slowly for the moving frame (S'). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship between the time intervals is given by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n5.  **Combine the formulas.**\n    *   By substituting the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula, we get:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt') = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation.**\n    *   I will use a Python script to compute the final value accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000 # km/s\ndt_prime = 50 # s\n\n# Calculate the beta factor (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d)\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>3061862\n\nThe calculation gives a distance of 3,061,862 km.

    "The problem involves concepts from special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy's reference frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta's reference frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The time given (50 seconds) is measured in this frame.\n\n2.  **List Given Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity of the ejecta with respect to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s` (a standard value used in relativity).\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Objective:**\n    *   Calculate the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n4.  **Relativistic Principles:**\n    *   From the Galaxy's perspective, time on the moving ejecta appears to pass more slowly. This is time dilation. The time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame is related to the time `Δt'` in the ejecta's frame by the Lorentz factor, γ (gamma).\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is simply its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in its own frame: `d = v * Δt`.\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c (beta).**\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1.02062`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n        This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame measures that 51.031 seconds have passed.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d).**\n        `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering time dilation: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option B. The slight difference is due to rounding in the provided option.\n\n<<<B>>>"
