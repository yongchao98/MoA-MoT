    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere. We want to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on the parallax (`plx`).\n\n2.  **Relating Star Count to Distance:** Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space around us. The shell has a radius `d` and a very small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this spherical shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV ≈ 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume: `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Introducing Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This can be rearranged to express distance in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Connecting the Differentials:** We have an expression for `dN` in terms of `d` and `dd`, but we need it in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`. To do this, we need to find the relationship between the infinitesimal distance interval `dd` and the corresponding infinitesimal parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d = plx⁻¹`\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1 / plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = - d(plx) / plx²`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. For counting stars in a given interval (a range of parallax), we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write: `|dd| = d(plx) / plx²`.\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = d(plx) / plx²`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (d(plx) / plx²) `\n\n6.  **Simplifying and Finding the Final Relation:** Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n    *   `dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, the number of stars per unit parallax range is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    `dN / d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
