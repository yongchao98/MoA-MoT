    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum (7 ppm) and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (137 ppm, 165 ppm).\n    *   A single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond.\n    *   Two ¹³C NMR peaks confirm the high symmetry: one peak for the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm is a typical chemical shift for electron-deficient alkene carbons) and one peak for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm is a typical shift for an anhydride carbonyl).\n    *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n    *   **Structure of Maleic Anhydride (the dienophile):**\n        ```\n             O\n            // \\\\\n        H--C----C--H\n          ||    ||\n        O=C----C=O\n            \\  /\n             O\n        ```\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. There are methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Position 5 is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   **Structure of the Diene:**\n        ```\n               CH3   CH3\n                \\   /\n                 C = C\n                /     \\\n             H₂C       C=C\n                \\     /  \\\n                 CH3    CH3\n        ```\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction and Products\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   This reaction produces a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Due to the stereochemistry of the approach of the dienophile to the diene, two main stereoisomers can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the *endo* adduct is kinetically favored and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is thermodynamically more stable but forms more slowly, making it the **minor product**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Structures of the Major and Minor Products\n\n*   **Endo Product (Major):** In the Diels-Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene derivatives, the *endo* configuration means the substituents from the dienophile are on the same side (*syn*) as the one-carbon bridge (the C7 bridge). In this case, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C7 bridge. This places the two protons that were originally on the maleic anhydride (let's call them H_a) on the outer, convex face of the molecule.\n*   **Exo Product (Minor):** The *exo* configuration means the substituents from the dienophile are on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. The anhydride ring points away from the C7 bridge. This places the H_a protons on the inner, concave face of the molecule, close to the C7 bridge.\n\nLet's visualize the key protons/groups in the major (*endo*) product:\n\n```\n      Major (Endo) Product         \n                                      \n             Me   Me  <-- Vinylic Methyls (~1.7 ppm)\n              \\   /                      \n               C=C                       \n              /   \\                      \n      Me----C-------C----Me  <-- Bridgehead Methyls (~1.0 ppm)\n           / \\     / \\                    \n         Ha--C-------C--Ha   <-- Anhydride Protons (~3.5 ppm)\n             \\  \\ /  /                    \n              \\  O  /                     \n               \\ | /\n              O=C-C=O\n                 |\n             C₇H₂ Bridge (behind)\n```\n\nIn the *endo* (major) product, the anhydride protons (H_a) are on the same face as the vinylic methyl groups. They are spatially close.\n\n### 4. Interpret the NOESY Spectra\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å), causing a cross-peak between their signals.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. We need to find an interaction that is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n*   **In the major (endo) product:** The anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinylic methyl groups are on the same convex face of the molecule. Their proximity will generate a strong NOE cross-peak.\n*   **In the minor (exo) product:** The anhydride protons (H_a) are on the concave face, while the vinylic methyl groups are on the convex face. They are far apart, so there will be no NOE cross-peak between them. Instead, H_a protons would be close to the C7 bridge protons in the exo isomer.\n*   Therefore, the differentiating cross-peak connects the anhydride protons (H_a) and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n### 5. Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option\n\nNow, let's assign the chemical shifts (ppm) to the relevant proton groups based on typical values:\n\n*   **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** These two protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. Their chemical shift will be relatively high. A value of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. They are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n*   **Vinylic Methyls:** These are methyl groups attached to a C=C double bond. A typical chemical shift is **~1.7 ppm**. There are two such groups, and they are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls:** These are methyl groups on saturated, quaternary carbons. A typical shift is **~1.0 ppm**. There are two such groups, and they are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n*   **C7 Bridge Protons:** These are two protons on a methylene bridge in a strained bicyclic system. Their shift would be around **~1.5 ppm**. (The \"1H doublet\" in the options is likely a simplification or refers to a potential loss of symmetry, but it is not relevant for identifying the correct NOE pair).\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons. Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between:\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic methyls)\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons)\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nOption D perfectly matches our conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
