    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of function. This is the most severe phenotype among all single mutants.\n    *   Now, let's look at the double mutants involving `g2`. The `g1g2` double mutant has a resistance of 0%. The `g2g3` double mutant also has a resistance of 0%.\n    *   In genetics, when a double mutant (`ab`) exhibits the same phenotype as one of the single mutants (`a`), gene `A` is said to be **epistatic** to gene `B`. This typically means gene `A` acts upstream of gene `B` in a genetic pathway.\n    *   Comparing `g1g2` (0% resistance) to its single mutants `g1` (75%) and `g2` (0%), we see that the double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g2` mutant. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   Comparing `g2g3` (0% resistance) to its single mutants `g2` (0%) and `g3` (50%), we see that the double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g2` mutant. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it must act upstream of both. The prompt states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. G2 fits this description perfectly, as a transcription factor would regulate the expression of downstream genes (like G1 and G3).\n    *   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. This eliminates option A.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n    *   Let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant. The resistance is 10%.\n    *   The single mutants `g1` and `g3` have 75% and 50% resistance, respectively.\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (10%) is much more severe than either of the single mutant phenotypes. This indicates a synergistic or additive effect. G1 and G3 are not in a simple linear pathway (e.g., G1 → G3). If they were, the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the upstream single mutant.\n    *   Instead, this result suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways downstream of G2, and both contribute to the overall resistance. The loss of both genes has a much greater effect than the loss of just one. This type of relationship, where two genes contribute to the same function and the loss of both is more severe than the loss of one, is a form of **gene redundancy** (specifically, partial redundancy).\n    *   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (or a synergistic interaction).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the conclusions.**\n    *   We need an option that states G2 is a transcription factor and that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor...** Incorrect. Our analysis shows G2 is the transcription factor.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter...** \"Same promoter\" cannot be concluded from this data. \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect because the double mutant `g1g3` (10%) has a different phenotype than `g1` (75%) or `g3` (50%).\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy...** \"Pleiotropy\" (a single gene affecting multiple traits) is not the best description for the interaction *between* G1 and G3 in this single pathway. \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect for the same reason as in B.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The third clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is factually incorrect based on the data. However, the first two clauses are the strongest and most accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment. Compared to the other options which contain definitive errors or less accurate descriptions, option D is the best possible answer. The incorrect epistasis claim is likely an error in the question's options, but the other two parts are strongly supported.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion based on the experimental data is best represented by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
