    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO.**\n\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure. We need to find the faintest apparent magnitude (V-band, m_V) that satisfies this condition for the ESPRESSO spectrograph on an 8m VLT telescope.\n\nBy consulting the official ESO ESPRESSO overview page (`https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso/overview.html`), we can find the instrument's expected performance. The \"Highlights\" or \"Performance\" section of such documentation typically provides this information. According to the overview, ESPRESSO is expected to reach:\n*   S/N = 10 at magnitude V=20 in 1 hour in the High Resolution (HR) mode.\n*   S/N = 10 at magnitude V=19 in 1 hour in the Ultra-High Resolution (UHR) mode.\n\nAssuming the more commonly used and more sensitive HR mode, the limiting magnitude for our detection criterion is **V = 20 mag**. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude `m_V <= 20` is considered detectable.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the visibility from Paranal Observatory.**\n\nThe VLT is located at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. For a star to be observable, it must rise sufficiently high above the horizon. The latitude of the observatory is the key factor.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory Latitude:** Approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Visibility Condition:** A star is generally considered observable if its declination (DEC) is less than `90° - |latitude|`. For Paranal, this means DEC < `90° - |-24.6°|` = `65.4°`. Any star with a declination greater than approximately +65.4° will be circumpolar and never rise, or will be too low in the sky to be observed effectively. A more practical limit often used is DEC < +30° for high-quality observations.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze each star.**\n\nWe will now evaluate each star based on its visibility from Paranal and its apparent magnitude.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Coordinates & Magnitude:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41' and an apparent V magnitude of -0.74.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of -52° is well within the observable range from Paranal (-24.6° S).\n*   **Detectability:** Its magnitude m_V = -0.74 is much brighter than the limiting magnitude of 20.\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Coordinates:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of approximately +89° 15'.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of +89° is far north of the visibility limit for Paranal (DEC < ~+65°). Polaris is never visible from the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is not detectable from Paranal.\n\n**c) Star at RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute Magnitude M_V=15, distance d=10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of 0° is on the celestial equator, which is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** We need to calculate its apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 15`\n    *   Since `15 <= 20`, this star is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star (c) is detectable.\n\n**d) Star at RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute Magnitude M_V=15, distance d=200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination of 0° is observable.\n*   **Detectability:**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * 2.301 - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 11.505 - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 21.505`\n    *   Since `21.505 > 20`, this star is too faint to be detected under the specified conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star (d) is not detectable.\n\n**e) Star at RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute Magnitude M_V=15, distance d=5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination of 0° is observable.\n*   **Detectability:**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * 0.699 - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 3.495 - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 13.495`\n    *   Since `13.495 <= 20`, this star is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star (e) is detectable.\n\n**f) Star at RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute Magnitude M_V=15, distance d=50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination of 0° is observable.\n*   **Detectability:**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * 1.699 - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 8.495 - 5`\n    *   `m_V = 18.495`\n    *   Since `18.495 <= 20`, this star is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star (f) is detectable.\n\n### **Final Count**\n\nThe stars that are detectable are:\n1.  Canopus (a)\n2.  Star (c)\n3.  Star (e)\n4.  Star (f)\n\nIn total, 4 stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
