    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. The Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit around its star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Let's write the expressions for each planet:\n$T_{eq,1} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}$\n$T_{eq,2} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}$\n\nNow, we can compute the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are identical for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the term $(1-A)^{1/4}$ also cancels. The expression simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-major Axis to Observational Data**\nWe are given data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) for each planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude K is also given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} v_{orb} = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star} + M_p)}{a}}$\nSince the planet's mass ($M_p$) is negligible compared to the star's mass ($M_{star}$), we can simplify this to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nThe problem mentions that the planets were detected using the transit method, which implies their orbits are viewed edge-on. Therefore, the inclination angle $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The equation becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nWe can now rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star}} \\frac{G}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes**\nUsing the formula for $a$, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_2^2}{M_{star} K_2^2}}{\\frac{G M_1^2}{M_{star} K_1^2}}$\n\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2}{K_2^2} \\frac{K_1^2}{M_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}}{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_0}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe ratio of the planet masses is:\n$\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 M_{earth}}{7 M_{earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Ratios ---\n# Mass ratio M2/M1\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5.0 / 7.0\n\n# Doppler shift ratio, which is equal to the RV amplitude ratio K1/K2\nlambda_ratio_1_over_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# Ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1)**2 * (lambda_ratio_1_over_2)**2\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\n# --- Output ---\n# Print the final result rounded to two decimal places to match the options.\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio_1_over_2:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2. This ratio is expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics Principles:**\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's orbit and albedo. The radial velocity (RV) method relates a planet's mass and orbital distance to the Doppler shift observed in the star's spectrum.\n\n**3. Write Down the Governing Equations:**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ = Star's effective temperature\n    *   $R_{star}$ = Star's radius\n    *   $a$ = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n    *   $A$ = Planet's Bond albedo\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The amplitude of the star's velocity wobble caused by an orbiting planet is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3} \\sqrt{1-e^2}}$\n    For a circular orbit, eccentricity $e=0$. Using Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_{star}+M_p)}a^3$), this can be simplified. A more direct form relating $K$ to the semi-major axis $a$ for a circular orbit is:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$ (assuming $M_p \\ll M_{star}$)\n    where:\n    *   $M_p$ = Planet's mass\n    *   $M_{star}$ = Star's mass\n    *   $i$ = Orbital inclination\n    *   $G$ = Gravitational constant\n\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity amplitude $K$ is related to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n**4. Formulate the Ratio and Simplify:**\nWe need to find $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$. Let's write the ratio using the equilibrium temperature formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (R_{star}/(2a_1))^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} (R_{star}/(2a_2))^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term cancels out.\n\nThe ratio simplifies significantly to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\nWe can use the radial velocity formula to find 'a'. Let's rearrange it to solve for $a$:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}} \\implies K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2 i}{M_{star}} \\frac{G}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2 i}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 \\sin^2 i_2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 \\sin^2 i_1 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n\nFurther simplifications:\n*   $G$ and $M_{star}$ are constants and cancel out.\n*   The problem states the planets were detected by the **transit method**, which means their orbits are seen nearly edge-on. Therefore, the inclination angle $i$ for both planets is approximately $90^\\circ$, and $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The $\\sin^2 i$ terms cancel out.\n\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes becomes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$), since $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe ratio of the planet masses is given:\n$\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow substitute these values back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**7. Compare with Options:**\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.536. Let's examine the choices:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe value `~ 0.53` is the closest match to our calculated result. The slight difference is likely due to rounding conventions used to create the problem options.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a Python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Mass of Planet 1 (in Earth masses)\nm1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 (in Earth masses)\nm2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 (in Angstroms)\nd_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 (in Angstroms)\nd_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1).\n# The ratio a2/a1 simplifies to (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2.\n# The ratio of RV amplitudes K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts d_lambda1/d_lambda2.\n\n# Ratio of masses (M2/M1)\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = m2 / m1\n\n# Ratio of RV amplitudes (K1/K2)\nk_ratio_1_over_2 = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# Ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1)\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1)**2 * (k_ratio_1_over_2)**2\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\n# Print the final result to compare with options\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures is: {temp_ratio}\")\nprint(f\"The value 15/28 is: {15/28}\")\n```\nThe python code execution gives a result of ~0.5357, which when rounded to two decimal places is 0.54. However, given the options, 0.53 is the clear choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$, where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $A$ is the albedo.\n    When taking the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and with the same albedo ($A_1=A_2$), the formula simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit detected via transit ($\\sin i \\approx 1$) is given by $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$.\n    Solving for the semi-major axis, $a$, we get $a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$.\n\n3.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can now find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Substitute Observational Data:**\n    *   The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$).\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n    *   The ratio of the planet masses ($M_2/M_1$) is given.\n        $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratios:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Now, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n    This value is closest to option B.
