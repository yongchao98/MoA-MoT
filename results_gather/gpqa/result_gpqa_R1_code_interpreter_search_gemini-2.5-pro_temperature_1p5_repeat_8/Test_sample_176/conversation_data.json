    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = A * σ * T⁴\n    where:\n    *   L is the luminosity.\n    *   A is the surface area of the star.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the surface temperature of the star.\n\n3.  **Express the Luminosity Ratio:** For two stars, Star 1 and Star 2, we can write their luminosities as:\n    L₁ = A₁ * σ * T₁⁴\n    L₂ = A₂ * σ * T₂⁴\n\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (A_1/A_2) * (T_1/T_2)⁴$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area Ratio:** Assuming the stars are spherical, their surface area is A = 4πR², where R is the radius.\n    The ratio of their areas is:\n    $A_1/A_2 = (4πR_1^2) / (4πR_2^2) = (R_1/R_2)^2$\n\n    The problem states that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2 ($R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$).\n    So, $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Therefore, the area ratio is $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a black body's surface temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max,em}$). This wavelength is measured in the star's own rest frame. The law is:\n        $\\lambda_{max,em} * T = b$, where b is Wien's constant.\n        This implies that $T$ is inversely proportional to $\\lambda_{max,em}$. The temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max,em,2} / \\lambda_{max,em,1}$.\n\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving object is shifted. The problem provides radial velocities, which affect the observed wavelength. The relationship between the emitted wavelength and the observed wavelength is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} * \\sqrt{(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)}$\n        where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    *   **Applying to the Stars:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$.\n        *   For Star 1: $v_1 = 0$ km/s. With zero velocity, there is no Doppler shift. Thus, the emitted peak wavelength is the same as the observed one: $\\lambda_{max,em,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,1}$.\n        *   For Star 2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s. There is a significant Doppler shift. The emitted peak wavelength is:\n            $\\lambda_{max,em,2} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2} / \\sqrt{(1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c)}$\n\n    *   **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can substitute these into the temperature ratio equation:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max,em,2} / \\lambda_{max,em,1}$\n        Since $\\lambda_{max,obs,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,2}$, and $\\lambda_{max,em,1} = \\lambda_{max,obs,1}$:\n        $T_1/T_2 = [\\lambda_{max,obs,1} / \\sqrt{(1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c)}] / \\lambda_{max,obs,1}$\n        $T_1/T_2 = 1 / \\sqrt{(1 + v_2/c) / (1 - v_2/c)} = \\sqrt{(1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c)}$\n\n6.  **Combine and Compute the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Now substitute the area ratio and temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)⁴$\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [\\sqrt{(1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c)}]^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 * [(1 - v_2/c) / (1 + v_2/c)]^2$\n\n    The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation, as the physical laws of black body radiation provide a direct path to the solution. Now, let's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nradius_ratio = 1.5\nvelocity_star2_kms = 700  # km/s\nspeed_of_light_kms = 299792.458  # km/s, using a more precise value\n\n# Calculate v/c\nv_over_c = velocity_star2_kms / speed_of_light_kms\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio squared\n# T_ratio^2 = (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)\ntemp_ratio_sq = (1 - v_over_c) / (1 + v_over_c)\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (radius_ratio)^2 * (temp_ratio_sq)^2\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * (temp_ratio_sq**2)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** First, I need to identify all the given information and the question being asked.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Radius of Star 1 ($R_1$) = 1.5 * Radius of Star 2 ($R_2$) -> $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n        *   Mass of Star 1 ($M_1$) = 1.5 * Mass of Star 2 ($M_2$)\n        *   The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same -> $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$\n        *   Radial velocity of Star 1 ($v_1$) = 0 km/s\n        *   Radial velocity of Star 2 ($v_2$) = 700 km/s\n        *   Assumption: Stars radiate as black bodies.\n    *   **Question:** What is the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$)?\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Physics Principles:**\n    *   The luminosity (L) of a black body is described by the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$, where A is the surface area, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n    *   The relationship between the surface temperature (T) and the peak *emitted* wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, em}$) of a black body is given by **Wien's Displacement Law**: $\\lambda_{max, em} \\cdot T = b$, where b is Wien's constant. This implies $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{max, em}$.\n    *   The relationship between the *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) and the *emitted* wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) for a moving source is described by the **Doppler Effect**. For light, the relativistic formula is: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$, where v is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, negative for moving closer) and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   **Step A:** Write the expression for the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.\n    *   **Step B:** Determine the ratio of the surface areas, $A_1/A_2$.\n    *   **Step C:** Determine the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1/T_2$. This is the most complex part and will involve Wien's Law and the Doppler Effect.\n    *   **Step D:** Combine the results from B and C into the formula from A and calculate the final numerical answer.\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Luminosity Ratio**\n        $L_1/L_2 = (A_1 \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T_1^4) / (A_2 \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T_2^4) = (A_1/A_2) \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n    *   **Step B: Area Ratio**\n        Stars are spheres, so the surface area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$.\n        $A_1/A_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2) / (4\\pi R_2^2) = (R_1/R_2)^2$.\n        Given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, the area ratio is $A_1/A_2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n    *   **Step C: Temperature Ratio**\n        From Wien's Law, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max, em, 2} / \\lambda_{max, em, 1}$. We need to find the emitted wavelengths.\n        We can rearrange the Doppler formula to solve for the emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{em} = \\lambda_{obs} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}$.\n\n        For Star 1: $v_1 = 0$. The Doppler term becomes $\\sqrt{(1-0)/(1+0)} = 1$. So, $\\lambda_{max, em, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 1}$.\n\n        For Star 2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s.\n        $\\lambda_{max, em, 2} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$.\n\n        Now, substitute these into the temperature ratio formula:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}}{\\lambda_{max, obs, 1}}$\n        Since the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$), they cancel out:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}$\n\n    *   **Step D: Combine and Calculate**\n        Substitute the area and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        $L_1/L_2 = (A_1/A_2) \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n        $L_1/L_2 = (2.25) \\cdot \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\\right)^4$\n        $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^2$\n\n        Now, I'll use the given values to compute the final number. The mass information is irrelevant. I will use a Python script for precision.\n        *   $v_2 = 700$ km/s\n        *   $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n        *   $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants and values\nv2 = 700.0  # km/s\nc = 299792.458  # speed of light in km/s\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# Calculate the term v2/c\nv_over_c = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio squared\n# T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - v_over_c) / (1 + v_over_c))\n# (T1/T2)^2 = (1 - v_over_c) / (1 + v_over_c)\ntemp_ratio_squared = (1 - v_over_c) / (1 + v_over_c)\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (radius_ratio^2) * (temp_ratio_squared^2)\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * (temp_ratio_squared**2)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\nThe calculation returns a value of approximately 2.229. When rounding to two decimal places, this is 2.23. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) ~2.35\n*   B) ~2.32\n*   C) ~2.25 (This would be the answer if there were no Doppler effect)\n*   D) ~2.23\n\nThe computed value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
