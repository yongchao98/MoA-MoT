    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral and not a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons), but the molecule must lack any internal elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. If a molecule has stereocenters but also has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, Cl, the carbon of the methyl group, and the first carbon of the ethyl group) lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. Planar molecules are always superimposable on their mirror images. Therefore, this molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name provides the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a, as (R) and (S) respectively (`3aR,7aS`). It also specifies the (E) geometry of the chloromethylene group. When a specific enantiomer is named using R/S notation, it implies that the molecule is chiral and the named substance is a single enantiomer. While some molecules with both R and S centers can be meso, the complex and unsymmetrical nature of the substituents (an (E)-chloromethylene group on the bridge) makes the presence of a plane of symmetry or center of inversion extremely unlikely. Naming a specific configuration `(3aR,7aS...)` designates a single chiral molecule. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3. The specific stereoisomer is (2R,3S). Let's examine its structure. If we draw it in an anti-periplanar (staggered) conformation and look down the C2-C3 bond, we can see that there is a center of inversion. The -COOH group on C2 is opposite to the -COOH on C3, the -CH3 on C2 is opposite to the -CH3 on C3, and the -H on C2 is opposite to the -H on C3. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters, both with the R configuration. This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound, which is non-superimposable. Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is a chiral molecule. A sample consisting of only the (2R,3R) enantiomer will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH2-CH= group (path towards C2), and (4) the -CH2-CH2-CH= group (path towards C6). Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The molecule as a whole lacks any internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetrical molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (Ïƒv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one carbon bearing an -OH group and the carbon atom opposite to it. For example, a plane contains C1-O1 and C4. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. This is isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any stereocenters.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has no substituents, so no chiral centers there.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   The -CH2- group next to the carbonyl is not chiral.\n        *   The next carbon is a -CH- group, which is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups (-CH3). Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality (like planar or axial chirality). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are three optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>"
