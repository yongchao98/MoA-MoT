    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We need to compare two different types of mean free paths (MFP) inside a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) vacuum chamber.\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with *each other*. This depends on the size of the gas molecules and their concentration (pressure and temperature).\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of high-energy electrons (from the microscope's beam) colliding/scattering with the *gas molecules*. This depends on the concentration of gas molecules and the electron-molecule scattering cross-section.\n    *   The key conditions are: high vacuum (< 10⁻⁹ Torr), high electron energy (1000 kV = 1 MeV), and constant temperature. The constant temperature and pressure mean the number density of gas molecules, *n*, is the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path:**\n    *   The general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where *n* is the number density of target particles and *σ* is the collision cross-section.\n    *   For **λ1** (molecule-molecule collisions), the formula is more specifically λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg), where σ_gg is the gas kinetic cross-section (roughly πd², with *d* being the molecule's diameter). The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the gas molecules. σ_gg represents the effective \"size\" of a molecule as seen by another molecule. This is like two billiard balls colliding.\n    *   For **λ2** (electron-molecule collisions), the formula is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg), where σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section. This represents the effective \"size\" of a molecule as seen by an electron.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **Molecule-Molecule (σ_gg):** This is a \"hard-sphere\" type collision. The size is determined by the electron clouds of the molecules repelling each other. The cross-section is relatively large, on the order of the geometric size of the molecule (e.g., ~10⁻¹⁹ m²).\n    *   **Electron-Molecule (σ_eg):** This is fundamentally different. The electron is a tiny, point-like particle. The \"collision\" is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) with the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. A 1000 kV electron is extremely energetic and fast-moving. An atom is mostly empty space to such a particle. The probability of a significant scattering event is much lower than for a molecule-molecule collision. Therefore, the effective target size, σ_eg, is much, much *smaller* than the gas kinetic cross-section, σ_gg.\n    *   **Conclusion:** σ_gg >> σ_eg.\n\n4.  **Compare the Mean Free Paths (λ1 vs. λ2):**\n    *   We have λ1 ∝ 1/σ_gg and λ2 ∝ 1/σ_eg.\n    *   Since the cross-section σ_eg is much smaller than σ_gg, the corresponding mean free path λ2 must be much larger than λ1.\n    *   An electron can travel, on average, a much longer distance than a gas molecule before an interaction occurs. This is precisely why high vacuum is essential for electron microscopy—to make λ2 extremely long so electrons can travel unimpeded from the source to the detector.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The underlying physics and cross-sections are different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This option correctly states λ2 > λ1, but it puts a very restrictive upper bound on λ2. Our analysis shows λ2 is *much* greater than λ1, not just slightly greater. For example, the ratio λ2/λ1 can be on the order of 10³ to 10⁴. So, this statement is false because λ2 will be larger than 1.22*λ1.\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply electrons are more likely to hit gas molecules than gas molecules are to hit each other, which is physically wrong for high-energy electrons.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option correctly captures the relationship λ2 > λ1. The factor of 1.22 simply sets a lower bound. Since our analysis concludes that λ2 is vastly larger than λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 times λ1. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physical reality of the situation. The number 1.22 is likely a distractor, and the core of the question is the qualitative relationship between the two mean free paths.\n\nThe conclusion is that the mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1). Therefore, λ2 >> λ1, which satisfies the condition λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
