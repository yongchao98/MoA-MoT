    "This problem requires the application of the method of images to find the potential energy of the system.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at a constant value of zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere is complex due to the induced charges on its surface. The method of images simplifies this by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The position and magnitude of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface where the sphere used to be is zero, satisfying the boundary condition.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge and Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center, on the same line as `q`) are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculate Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The method of images tells us that this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the fictitious image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Force:** Let's calculate the force `F(x)` on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center (`x > R`).\n    *   The image charge at this point would be `q'(x) = -q * (R/x)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge would be `b(x) = R^2 / x`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `x`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b(x)`) is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force between them (which is the force on `q` from the sphere) is given by Coulomb's Law:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n        `F(x) = k * q * [-q(R/x)] / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x / [(x^2 - R^2)/x]^2`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x * [x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2]`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive (towards the sphere).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Work Done (Potential Energy):** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to assemble it. We can calculate this by integrating the force required to move the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. The change in potential energy is the negative of the work done by the conservative electric field.\n    `U(d) - U(∞) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    Assuming `U(∞) = 0`, we get:\n    `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n7.  **Solve the Integral:** We use a substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`. Then `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du / 2`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `∫ [1 / u^2] * (du / 2) = (1/2) * ∫ u^(-2) du = (1/2) * (-1 * u^(-1)) = -1 / (2u)`\n    Substituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral is `-1 / [2(x^2 - R^2)]`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:**\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))] }`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - 0 }`\n    `U(d) = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n9.  **Final Result:**\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n10. **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur derived result matches option D perfectly.\n\n### Alternative reasoning for the 1/2 factor\nThe interaction energy can also be found by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the position of `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and its potential) is created by and is proportional to `q` itself.\n*   `V_induced` at `d` is the potential from the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-q(R/d)] / (d - R^2/d) = -k*q*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k*q*R / (d^2 - R^2)] = -(1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nThis confirms the result again.\n\n<<<D>>>"
