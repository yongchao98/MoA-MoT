    "The user wants to compute the area of a surface given its metric.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Metric and the Area Element**\n\nThe given line element is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a 2-dimensional metric of the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$. By comparing the given expression, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g$:\n$g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe metric tensor is:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ for a 2D surface is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$.\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx} \\cdot g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2 - 0 = \\frac{32^2}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^2}$\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the coefficient of the area element:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{32^2}{(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^2}} = \\frac{32}{|4-x^{2}-y^{2}|}$\n\nSo, the area element is:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{|4-x^{2}-y^{2}|} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### **2. Determining the Domain of Integration**\n\nFor the metric to describe a real surface with positive distances (a Riemannian manifold), the components of the metric tensor must be positive. This means:\n$g_{xx} > 0 \\implies \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} > 0 \\implies 4-x^{2}-y^{2} > 0$\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n$x^{2}+y^{2} < 4$\n\nThis describes an open disk in the xy-plane with radius 2, centered at the origin. The phrase \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" refers to this surface, where the parameter $R=2$ defines the boundary of the coordinate chart. The total area is found by integrating the area element $dA$ over this entire disk.\nInside this disk, $4-x^{2}-y^{2}$ is positive, so $|4-x^{2}-y^{2}| = 4-x^{2}-y^{2}$.\n\nThe area $A$ is therefore given by the integral:\n$A = \\iint_{x^2+y^2 < 4} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Integral**\n\nThis integral is best solved by converting to polar coordinates. We use the substitution:\n$x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n$y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\nSo, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. The differential area element is $dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain of integration $x^2+y^2 < 4$ transforms to:\n$0 \\le r < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\nFirst, we can integrate with respect to $\\theta$, as the integrand does not depend on it:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi$\nSo, $A = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = 64\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$\n\nThe integral with respect to $r$ is an improper integral because the denominator $4-r^2$ becomes zero at the upper limit of integration, $r=2$. We need to evaluate it using a limit:\n$A = 64\\pi \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{b} \\frac{r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$\n\nTo solve the integral, we use a u-substitution:\nLet $u = 4-r^2$. Then $du = -2r \\, dr$, which implies $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} \\, du$.\nThe limits for $u$ are:\nWhen $r=0$, $u = 4-0^2 = 4$.\nWhen $r=b$, $u = 4-b^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int_{0}^{b} \\frac{r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\int_{4}^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\, du\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{4}^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du$\n$= -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{4}^{4-b^2} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\ln(4-b^2) - \\ln(4) \\right)$\n(Note: Since $b<2$, $4-b^2 > 0$, so absolute values are not needed).\n\nNow, we take the limit as $b \\to 2^{-}$:\n$\\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\ln(4-b^2) - \\ln(4) \\right) \\right]$\nAs $b \\to 2^{-}$, the term $4-b^2 \\to 0^{+}$. The natural logarithm $\\ln(z) \\to -\\infty$ as $z \\to 0^{+}$.\nSo, $\\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\ln(4-b^2) = -\\infty$.\n\nThe value of the integral is:\n$-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( (-\\infty) - \\ln(4) \\right) = +\\infty$\n\nSince the integral diverges to infinity, the total area is:\n$A = 64\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the given pseudosphere is infinite. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
