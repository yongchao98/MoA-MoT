    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem asks about the ratio of the number of atoms in different energy levels within a star's photosphere. Assuming the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this ratio is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to a lower energy state (level 1) is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right) $$\n    where:\n    *   $n_2$ and $n_1$ are the number densities of atoms in level 2 and level 1, respectively.\n    *   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels. This ratio is a constant for a given transition.\n    *   $E_2 - E_1 = \\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the ratio and the factor:** Let's define the ratio as $R = n_2/n_1$. The problem states that this ratio *decreases* when the star has spots (i.e., when the temperature is lower). This is consistent with the Boltzmann equation, as a lower temperature $T$ results in a more negative exponent, hence a smaller ratio $R$.\n    The problem asks for \"the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the ratios:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_{\\text{no spot}}}{R_{\\text{spot}}} $$\n\n4.  **Set up the calculation for the factor:**\n    *   Let $T_{\\text{no spot}} = 6000$ K be the temperature without spots.\n    *   Let $T_{\\text{spot}} = 5500$ K be the effective temperature with spots.\n    The problem provides other information (radius, mass, spot coverage), but this is context to explain *why* the effective temperature changes. The core calculation only requires the two temperatures and the energy of the transition.\n\n    $$ R_{\\text{no spot}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spot}}}\\right) $$\n    $$ R_{\\text{spot}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spot}}}\\right) $$\n    The factor is:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spot}}}\\right)}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spot}}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spot}}}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spot}}}\\right)} $$\n    Using the property of exponents $\\frac{e^a}{e^b} = e^{a-b}$, we get:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spot}}} - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spot}}}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spot}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spot}}}\\right)\\right) $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the energy difference ($\\Delta E$):** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength $\\lambda = 1448$ Å ($1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m).\n    The formula is $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda$, where:\n    *   $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n\n6.  **Perform the numerical calculation:** We can now substitute all the values into the formula for the factor. A Python script is efficient for this computation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Define the given parameters from the problem\nwavelength_m = 1448e-10  # Wavelength converted to meters\nT_nospot = 6000.0      # Temperature of the unspotted star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5500.0        # Effective temperature of the spotted star in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) for the transition\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength_m\n\n# Calculate the exponential term for the factor\n# Factor = exp( (Delta_E / k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1.0/T_spot - 1.0/T_nospot)\nfactor = math.exp(exponent)\n\n# Print the final result, formatted to two decimal places\nprint(f\"{factor:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>4.52\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.52.

    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K (no spots) to 5500 K (with spots).\n\n**1. Underlying Physics:**\nThe ratio of the populations of two energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n$$ \\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}\\right) $$\nwhere:\n-   $n_2/n_1$ is the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper state (level 2) to the lower state (level 1).\n-   $g_2/g_1$ is the ratio of the statistical weights of the levels, which is a constant for this specific transition.\n-   $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n-   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n-   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Defining the Factor:**\nLet's denote the ratio at the \"no spot\" temperature ($T_{\\text{no spot}} = 6000$ K) as $R_{\\text{no spot}}$ and the ratio at the \"spot\" temperature ($T_{\\text{spot}} = 5500$ K) as $R_{\\text{spot}}$.\n\n$$ R_{\\text{no spot}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spot}}}\\right) $$\n$$ R_{\\text{spot}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spot}}}\\right) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *from* the spotted case *to* the unspotted case (\"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\"). This is the ratio of the two ratios:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_{\\text{no spot}}}{R_{\\text{spot}}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the ratios:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spot}}}\\right)}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spot}}}\\right)} $$\n\nThe term $g_2/g_1$ cancels out. Using the property of exponents $\\exp(a)/\\exp(b) = \\exp(a-b)$:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{no spot}}} + \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spot}}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left[\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spot}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spot}}}\\right)\\right] $$\n\n**3. Calculating the Energy Difference ($\\Delta E$):**\nThe energy difference corresponds to a transition with a wavelength $\\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m. The energy of a photon for this transition is given by:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere:\n-   $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s).\n-   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nNow we substitute the values into the formula for the factor.\n\n-   $T_{\\text{no spot}} = 6000$ K\n-   $T_{\\text{spot}} = 5500$ K\n-   $\\Delta E/k = hc/(k\\lambda)$\n\nLet's plug the numbers in:\n\n-   $1/T_{\\text{spot}} - 1/T_{\\text{no spot}} = 1/5500 - 1/6000 \\approx 1.818 \\times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \\times 10^{-4} = 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ K}^{-1}$\n-   $\\Delta E = (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s} \\times 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) / (1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.373 \\times 10^{-18}$ J\n-   $\\Delta E / k = (1.373 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ J}) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}) \\approx 99490$ K\n\nNow, calculate the exponent for the final factor:\nExponent = $(\\Delta E / k) \\times (1/T_{\\text{spot}} - 1/T_{\\text{no spot}}) \\approx 99490 \\text{ K} \\times 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ K}^{-1} \\approx 1.507$\n\nFactor = $\\exp(1.507) \\approx 4.51$\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation. The factor is approximately 4.51, which is closest to the value in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
