    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X:** Contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Reacts violently. Is a reagent in organic chemistry, with a close analog.\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Reacts violently with X.\n    *   **Gas W:** Released during the reaction. A key property is that its molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Forms during the reaction.\n    *   **Substance B:** Released when G is heated. Has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of reacting a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze Gas W and Substance B:**\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K (277 - 273.15 ≈ 3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is produced by heating the precipitate G, it implies the heavy isotope present in the system is Deuterium (D).\n    *   Now let's analyze Gas W, whose molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test common diatomic gases.\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Yes, this fits.**\n        *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes, but less likely to be produced from this type of reaction.\n        *   HF: 10 protons (9 from F, 1 from H), 10 neutrons (10 from F, 0 from H). **Yes, this also fits.**\n    *   Given that the system clearly involves Deuterium (from B = D₂O), the most logical conclusion is that **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X and Y:**\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    *   The release of D₂ gas from a reaction suggests that either X or Y must be a source of deuterium.\n    *   The most common violent reactions that release hydrogen gas involve reactive metals or metal hydrides with water.\n    *   Let's propose a reaction scheme:\n        *   Scheme 1: X (a deuteride compound) + Y (H₂O). Example: CaD₂ + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + 2HD. The gas produced is HD (2p, 1n), which doesn't fit the p=n rule for gas W. So this is incorrect.\n        *   Scheme 2: X (a reactive substance) + Y (D₂O). Example: Metal + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide + D₂. This fits perfectly. The gas W is D₂, and the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   So, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    *   We also know G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing: M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O. This confirms that **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X is a substance used in organic chemistry, has a close analog, and reacts violently with D₂O to form a metal deuteroxide precipitate. This strongly points to a powerful reducing agent, specifically a complex metal hydride. The most common one that fits this description is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   The \"close analog\" is LiAlH₄, which means Substance X, containing a heavier isotope (D), must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's verify this choice against all clues:\n        *   **Heavier isotope:** Yes, Deuterium (D).\n        *   **Reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O):** Yes. The reaction is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas). It's famously violent.\n        *   **Gas W with p=n:** Yes, D₂ is produced.\n        *   **Precipitate G forms:** Yes, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is a gelatinous precipitate.\n        *   **G (Al(OD)₃) releases B (D₂O) on heating:** Yes. 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n        *   **Keto acid reaction:** A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) is reduced by LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This product contains **2 oxygen atoms**, which matches the clue.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Z(H)=1, Z(Li)=3, Z(Al)=13.\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers, as is standard for this type of problem and implied by the integer answer choices.\n        *   Mass number of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the Aluminum isotope (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   There are **four** atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as D).\n    *   Total mass from lightest element = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is **one** atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = (Total mass from lightest) + (Total mass from heaviest) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
