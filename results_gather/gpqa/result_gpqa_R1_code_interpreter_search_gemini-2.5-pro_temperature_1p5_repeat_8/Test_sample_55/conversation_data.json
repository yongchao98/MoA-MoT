    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Path**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩ (the 3s state) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0⟩ (the 1s state) through a two-step process involving electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n    The selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n    *   Δn = any integer (principal quantum number can change by any amount).\n    *   Δl = ±1 (orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by 1).\n    *   Δm = 0, ±1 (magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1).\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State |n', l', m'⟩**\n    *   **First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   The decay process means energy is released, so the principal quantum number must decrease, i.e., n' < 3.\n        *   The combination n'=1, l'=1 is not possible, as for a given n, l must be less than n (l ≤ n-1).\n        *   Therefore, the only possible value for n' is 2. The intermediate state must have n'=2 and l'=1. This is the 2p state.\n        *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm = 0, ±1, the magnetic quantum number m' of the intermediate state can be m' = 0-1 = -1, m' = 0+0 = 0, or m' = 0+1 = 1.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        *   Let's verify that a transition from the |2,1,m'⟩ states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   The change in l is from l'=1 to l_final=0, so Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   The change in m depends on m'.\n            *   For |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - 0 = 0. Allowed.\n            *   For |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - 1 = -1. Allowed.\n            *   For |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1. Allowed.\n        *   All three cascade routes are physically possible. The options provided in the question confirm this, listing these specific routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios for each step. For the route passing through the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩, the probability is:\n    P(route via m') = BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) × BR(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step (BR₂):** From any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, the only allowed E1 decay is to the |1,0,0⟩ state. There are no other lower-energy states to which it can decay via an E1 transition. Thus, the probability of this step occurring, given the atom is in the |2,1,m'⟩ state, is 1. So, BR(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1 for all m'.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step (BR₁):** The probability of the route is now simplified to the branching ratio of the first step:\n    P(route via m') = BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩)\n\n    The branching ratio for a specific channel is the decay rate for that channel divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n    BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) / Γ_total(|3,0,0⟩)\n\n    The total decay rate is the sum of the rates to all possible final states:\n    Γ_total(|3,0,0⟩) = Γ(→ |2,1,-1⟩) + Γ(→ |2,1,0⟩) + Γ(→ |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    The transition rate Γ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, |⟨f|**d**|i⟩|². The key physical principle here is the isotropy of space. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (l=0). When such a state undergoes spontaneous emission into the vacuum (which is also isotropic, having no preferred direction), the probability of transitioning to any of the degenerate m' sub-levels of the final p-state is equal. This is a direct consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates are equal:\n    Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    Let's call this rate G. Then the total rate is Γ_total = G + G + G = 3G.\n    The branching ratio for any specific route (e.g., via m'=0) is:\n    BR(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = G / (3G) = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n    The probability for each of the three possible routes is 1/3.\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩) = 1/3\n\n    Now we compare this result with the given options:\n    A) ... and 1/4 (Incorrect)\n    B) ... |2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct)\n    C) ... and 2/3 (Incorrect)\n    D) ... and 1/4 (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct option is the one that lists a valid route with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
