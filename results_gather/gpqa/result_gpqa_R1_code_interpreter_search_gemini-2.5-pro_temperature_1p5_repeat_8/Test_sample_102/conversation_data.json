    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent is benzene.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, ortho,para-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-directing. Can be converted to a meta-directing -NH3+ group in strong acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate the General Strategy**\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern is crucial.\n*   A simple approach would be to install two meta-directing groups, which would then direct a third substituent to the position between them (position 5). For example, brominating 3-nitroacetophenone. Both -COCH3 and -NO2 are meta-directors and would direct Br to the 5-position. However, the ring would be extremely deactivated, making the reaction very difficult and likely low-yield.\n*   A more sophisticated strategy, often required for complex substitution patterns, is to use a \"placeholder\" directing group (like -NH2) that can be modified or removed later. The presence of diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) and deamination (H3PO2) reagents in the options strongly suggests such a strategy is intended. The sequence Ar-NH2 --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Ar-N2+ --(H3PO2)--> Ar-H removes an amino group.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) Nitration -> Nitrobenzene. ii) Reduction -> Aniline. iii) Acylation of Amine -> Acetanilide. iv) Bromination -> p-Bromoacetanilide. v) Nitration -> 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide. vi) Hydrolysis (implicit) and Diazotization -> 4-bromo-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt. vii) Deamination -> **1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene**. This is not the target molecule as it lacks the acetyl group.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) Nitration -> Nitrobenzene. ii) Reduction -> Aniline. iii) Diazotization -> Benzenediazonium chloride. iv) Deamination -> **Benzene**. This sequence is a pointless loop that returns to the starting material.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Bromination -> Bromobenzene. ii) Nitration -> p-Bromonitrobenzene. iii) Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) -> This reaction is very difficult on a ring deactivated by both -Br and -NO2. Assuming it works and gives the reinforced product (2-acetyl-4-bromonitrobenzene, i.e., 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone), the next step is (iv) Nitration. Nitrating a ring with three deactivating groups is extremely difficult. If we follow the whole sequence, it leads to **3-bromoacetophenone**, not the target.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's trace this path carefully.\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone.**\n       (-COCH3 is a meta-director).\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n       (Acylation is followed by bromination, which is directed to the meta position).\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Intermediate.**\n       Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives a mixture of isomers. For this synthetic route to be viable, we need to form an isomer that can lead to the final product. Let's assume we form and isolate **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone**. (This isomer results from ortho-direction by the bromo group).\n    iv) **3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl -> 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone.**\n       (The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group).\n    v) **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.**\n       This is a critical step. We are nitrating an aniline derivative. The amino group (-NH2) is a very strong ortho,para-director and will control the substitution. Its ortho position is C5 and its para position (C1) is blocked. The acetyl group (-COCH3) also directs meta to C5. Therefore, nitration occurs regioselectively at C5. While aniline nitration can be complex in strong acid, the directing effects strongly favor the required C5 isomer.\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl -> ...diazonium salt.**\n       (The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt).\n    vii) **...diazonium salt + H3PO2 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n       (The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination). Removing the group at C4 leaves the acetyl group at C1, the bromo group at C3, and the nitro group at C5).\n\nThis sequence successfully constructs the target molecule with the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern. It cleverly uses an amino group as a director, which is later removed to achieve a substitution pattern that would be difficult to obtain by direct electrophilic substitution alone.\n\nTherefore, sequence D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
