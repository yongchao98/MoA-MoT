    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance (also known as the decay length) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Concepts:**\n    *   The mean decay distance, $L$, of a relativistic particle is the distance it travels in the lab frame during its lifetime.\n    *   The formula for the mean decay distance is $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$. So, $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   The particle's velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$.\n    *   Combining these, the formula for the mean decay distance becomes $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n    *   The proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ of a particle is related to its decay width $\\Gamma$ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Substituting $\\tau_0$ into the decay length formula, we get: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$.\n    *   It is often convenient to use the product $\\hbar c$, which has units of energy×length (e.g., MeV·fm). The formula can be rewritten as: $L = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Production energy, $E_X = 8$ GeV\n    *   Mass, $m_X = 1.2$ GeV\n    *   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV\n\n4.  **Develop a Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.** The relativistic energy is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$. In particle physics units where energy is in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², this simplifies to $E = \\gamma m$. Therefore, $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X}$.\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the velocity factor, $\\beta$.** The relationship between $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$. We can rearrange this to find $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$. The product $\\gamma\\beta$ can be calculated as $\\gamma\\beta = \\gamma\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   **Step 3: An alternative way to express $\\gamma\\beta$.** The relativistic momentum, $p$, is related to energy and mass by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. Also, $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$. This means $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$. This expression is equivalent to $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$ and can be more direct to calculate.\n    *   **Step 4: Combine everything to calculate the mean decay distance, $L$.** Use the formula $L = \\gamma\\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$ or $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$. We need a value for $\\hbar c$. A standard value is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV·fm.\n    *   **Step 5: Convert units.** The result from the formula will be in femtometers (fm). We need to convert this to meters (m) to match the options ($1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$).\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation using a Python Script for Precision:**\n    *   To avoid manual calculation errors and ensure high precision, it's efficient to use a small script. The script will implement the formulas derived above. It will take the given inputs, use the standard value for $\\hbar c$, compute the result, and convert it to the final required units.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE_X_GeV = 8.0  # Production energy in GeV\nm_X_GeV = 1.2  # Mass in GeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0  # Decay width in MeV\n\n# Constants\n# hbar*c in MeV*fm. This is a standard value in particle physics.\nhbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n# Convert all energy units to MeV for consistency\nE_X_MeV = E_X_GeV * 1000\nm_X_MeV = m_X_GeV * 1000\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate gamma and beta (or gamma*beta directly)\n# We use the formula involving momentum, which is often more direct.\n# The term (pc) in units of MeV can be calculated from E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\npc_MeV = np.sqrt(E_X_MeV**2 - m_X_MeV**2)\n\n# The factor gamma*beta is equivalent to pc / (mc^2)\ngamma_beta = pc_MeV / m_X_MeV\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance L using the formula L = gamma*beta * (hbar*c / Gamma)\n# The result will be in femtometers (fm)\nL_fm = gamma_beta * (hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV)\n\n# Step 4: Convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m)\n# 1 fm = 10^-15 m\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the final result in the required format for comparison with options.\nprint(f\"{L_m:.4e} m\")\n```\n>>>\n4.0645e-15 m\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result and Select the Answer:**\n    *   The calculation gives the mean decay distance as $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n    *   Let's compare this with the given options:\n        A) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n        B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n        C) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n        D) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    *   The calculated value $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option B, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. The small discrepancy (about 0.024%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values or the options themselves. The magnitude and the significant figures are a clear match. Options C and D are off by an order of magnitude, and option A is significantly different. Therefore, B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the concepts:**\n    The mean decay distance ($L$) is the average distance a particle travels before it decays. For a relativistic particle, this distance is affected by time dilation. The formula is:\n    $L = \\gamma \\cdot \\beta \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n    where:\n    *   $\\tau_0$ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, representing the time dilation effect.\n    *   $\\beta$ is the particle's speed as a fraction of the speed of light ($v/c$).\n\n2.  **Relate lifetime to decay width:**\n    The proper mean lifetime $\\tau_0$ is related to the decay width $\\Gamma$ by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas:**\n    Substituting the expression for $\\tau_0$ into the decay distance formula, we get:\n    $L = \\gamma \\cdot \\beta \\cdot c \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\gamma \\cdot \\beta \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    The product $\\hbar c$ is a convenient constant in particle physics, approximately equal to $197.3$ MeV·fm.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor terms ($\\gamma$ and $\\beta$):**\n    The relativistic energy ($E$) is related to mass ($m$) and the Lorentz factor by $E = \\gamma m c^2$. In particle physics units (where energy is in GeV and mass is in GeV/c²), this simplifies to $E = \\gamma m$.\n    We can calculate $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{8000 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 6.667$\n\n    The relationship between $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$. We can calculate the product $\\gamma\\beta$ which represents the particle's momentum divided by its mass ($p/m$). A more direct way to calculate $\\gamma\\beta$ is using the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    This gives $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n    Then, $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n    $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8 \\, \\text{GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\, \\text{GeV})^2}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx \\frac{7.9095}{1.2} \\approx 6.591$\n\n5.  **Calculate the mean decay distance:**\n    Now we plug all the values into the combined formula. It is crucial to use consistent units (e.g., all energies in MeV).\n    *   $\\gamma\\beta \\approx 6.591$\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV·fm\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV\n\n    $L = (6.591) \\times \\frac{197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n    $L \\approx 6.591 \\times 0.6166 \\, \\text{fm}$\n    $L \\approx 4.0645 \\, \\text{fm}$\n\n6.  **Convert to meters:**\n    Since $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$, the mean decay distance in meters is:\n    $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated value $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option B.\n\n    A) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n    B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n    C) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n    D) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe python code confirmed this calculation, giving a result of `4.0645e-15 m`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
