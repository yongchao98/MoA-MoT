    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the conserved quantity:** In any isolated system with a conservative force, the total energy is conserved. For a relativistic particle in a potential field, the total conserved energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the energies:**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the relativistic kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system at any position $x$ and velocity $v$ is $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum amplitude ($x=A$):**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the particle momentarily stops before changing direction. So, its velocity is $v=0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy at this point is $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is therefore:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at the equilibrium position ($x=0$):**\n    *   The potential energy is at its minimum at the equilibrium position, so the kinetic energy (and thus the speed) must be at its maximum. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n    *   At $x=0$, the potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor corresponding to the maximum speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy:**\n    *   The total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    *   $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    *   First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ from the energy equation:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\n    *   Now substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, we can first square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$.\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$.\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$.\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
