    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the product from the given NMR data.**\n\n    The problem provides the ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra for the product of a reaction involving compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O). Let's deduce the structure of this product first.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   δ 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group that is not adjacent to any protons. Its chemical shift (~2.3 ppm) is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (an aryl-CH₃).\n        *   Combining these observations, we have a **p-tolyl group** (or 4-methylphenyl group).\n        *   δ 7.68 (1H, d) and 6.75 (1H, d): These are two doublets, each for one proton, in the vinylic region. This indicates a **disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-)**. The large coupling constant implied by the splitting (though not given, 'd' implies significant coupling) suggests a *trans* configuration. The proton at δ 7.68 is significantly deshielded, suggesting it is beta to a carbonyl group and adjacent to the aromatic ring. The proton at δ 6.75 is alpha to a carbonyl group.\n        *   δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another methyl group as a singlet. A chemical shift around 2.3 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an **acetyl group**, CH₃-C=O).\n\n    *   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n        *   δ 197.7 (1C, s): This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a **ketone carbonyl carbon**.\n        *   δ 144.1, 141.5, 130.3, 129.1 (2C), 127.1, 126.9 (2C): These are the signals for the aromatic and vinylic carbons. The signals at 144.1 ppm and 141.5 ppm are likely the two quaternary carbons of the p-substituted ring and the deshielded vinylic carbon. The signals at 129.1 ppm (2C) and 126.9 ppm (2C) are the four aromatic CH carbons. The remaining signals at 130.3 ppm and 127.1 ppm correspond to the two vinylic CH carbons.\n        *   δ 28.4 (1C, s) and δ 21.3 (1C, s): These are the two aliphatic carbons. δ 21.3 is characteristic of the methyl group on the aromatic ring, and δ 28.4 is characteristic of the methyl ketone carbon.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        Based on all the fragments identified (p-tolyl group, a trans-CH=CH- group, and a ketone), the structure of the product is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        Structure: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n        This structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O and all the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and deduce the starting material (Compound X).**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) reacts with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (130 °C).\n    *   **Reactants and Products:** We are transforming Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) into (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one (C₁₁H₁₂O). This is an isomerization or rearrangement reaction.\n    *   **Reagent Role:** DABCO is a non-nucleophilic base. The high temperature suggests a thermally promoted reaction, likely facilitated by the base.\n    *   **Connecting Product to Reactant:** The reaction is an isomerization. The starting material must have the same atoms as the product. Specifically, it must contain a p-tolyl group. Looking at the options provided for compound X:\n        *   A) 2-styrylepoxide: Has a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a p-tolyl group. Also has the wrong formula (C₁₀H₁₀O).\n        *   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n        *   C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n        *   D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: This molecule has a 4-methylstyryl group, which is composed of a p-tolyl group attached to a vinyl group. Its formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. This is the only option that contains the required p-tolyl moiety.\n        Structure of D: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH-O-CH₂ (with the last three carbons and oxygen forming an epoxide ring). This is a vinylic epoxide.\n\n*   **Step 3: Propose a Mechanism.**\n    The rearrangement of a vinylic epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone is a known reaction, often catalyzed by a base.\n    1.  DABCO, the base, abstracts the most acidic proton, which is the allylic proton on the carbon of the epoxide ring that is adjacent to the double bond.\n    2.  This generates a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate undergoes a concerted electronic rearrangement: the C-O bond of the epoxide ring breaks, forming an enolate anion.\n    4.  Protonation of the enolate (either from the protonated DABCO or during workup) initially forms an enol, which rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable keto form, yielding the final product, (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\nSince only option D possesses the p-tolyl group necessary to form the identified product, it must be the correct starting material, Compound X.\n\n<<<D>>>"
