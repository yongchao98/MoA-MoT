    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Velocities**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n        *   The **Laboratory Frame (S)**, where the observer is at rest.\n        *   The **Glass Frame (S')**, which is the rest frame of the moving glass.\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`. The problem states it's moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   The speed of light *within* the glass (in its own rest frame, S') is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`), so `n = c / u'`. This means `u' = c / n`.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this `u`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula**\n    When two velocities are in the same direction, the relativistic formula for adding velocities `u'` and `v` is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n3.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n    *   We are given `c = 1`.\n    *   From step 1, we know `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n    *   The velocity of the glass is `v`.\n\n    Substituting these into the velocity-addition formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression**\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To make this expression look like the given options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    Let's compare our final result with the given choices:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n\n    Our calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
