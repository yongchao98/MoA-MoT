    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principles:** The problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method relies on measuring the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star, which is caused by the star \"wobbling\" as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet.\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The observed quantity is the periodic wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    *   Therefore, we can write the relationship: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}}$.\n    *   Given the values in the problem: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ mÅ and $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ mÅ.\n    *   So, $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** For a planet of mass $m_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_*$ in a circular orbit of period $P$, the star's velocity amplitude is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship for This Specific Problem:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{*,1} = M_{*,2}$.\n    *   The planets have the same mass: $m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$.\n    *   The RV method measures the \"minimum mass\", which is $m_p \\sin(i)$. The phrasing \"planets with masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that the value of $m_p \\sin(i)$ is the same for both planets. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n    *   The terms $G$ and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ are the same for both systems. The only variables that differ are $K$ and the orbital period $P$. The relationship simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:**\n    We can write the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes for the two systems as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    We want to find $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^{-3} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^{3}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the Known Values and Calculate:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the RV amplitudes we found in step 2:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^{3}$\n\n    Now, we perform the calculation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nTo get a decimal value, we can use a simple calculation.\n```python\nprint((5/7)**3)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314798317711\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3644.\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated ratio $\\approx 0.36$ matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K). Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7 \\text{ mÅ} / 5 \\text{ mÅ} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Formula for K:** The formula for the radial velocity amplitude K for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    where P is the orbital period, $m_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Relation:** The problem states that the star masses ($M_*$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are the same. We can also assume the orbital inclinations are similar since it's not specified otherwise. The terms $2\\pi$ and G are constants. This means that all terms in the formula are constant for both systems except for K and P. The relationship simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** We can set up a ratio based on the proportionality:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = (P_2 / P_1)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the periods, $P_2 / P_1$. We can rearrange the equation:\n    $P_2 / P_1 = (K_2 / K_1)^{-3} = (K_1 / K_2)^3$\n\n5.  **Calculation:** Now, we substitute the ratio of the velocities:\n    $P_2 / P_1 = (5 / 7)^3 = 125 / 343 \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
