    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This specific frequency is characteristic of an ester. The conjugation with the benzene ring would normally lower this frequency slightly, but 1720 cm-1 is well within the expected range for an aromatic ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large chemical shift difference between the two doublets suggests the ring is substituted with one strong electron-donating group (EDG) and one strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n    *   **Ethyl Group:**\n        *   The signal at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as indicated by the triplet splitting (2+1=3 peaks).\n        *   The signal at **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-), as indicated by the quartet splitting (3+1=4 peaks). The very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-).\n        *   Together, these two signals confirm the presence of an ethoxy group that is part of an ester: -O-CH2CH3.\n    *   **Amine Protons:** The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is consistent with the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is typical for amine protons due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling with nitrogen.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2), which is an EDG, and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an EWG.\n    3.  Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    4.  Let's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n        *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) would be the most deshielded, corresponding to the signal at **8.0 ppm**.\n        *   The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2) would be the most shielded, corresponding to the signal at **7.0 ppm**.\n        *   The ethoxy group signals and the amine signal match perfectly.\n        *   The molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is an amide, not an ester. IR C=O would be ~1670 cm-1.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2CO-), and its -CH2- would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the IR and 1H NMR data.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern. It is also an amide, not an ester.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
