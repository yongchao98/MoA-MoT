    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory. This construction has fundamental implications for the symmetries that must be respected by all terms (operators) in the SMEFT Lagrangian. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The principle of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. In quantum field theory, this is enforced by requiring the Lagrangian to be a Lorentz scalar. SMEFT is, by construction, a relativistic theory, meaning all its operators must be built in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** This is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, encompassing Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational assumption of the framework upon which SMEFT is built. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established experimentally that the Standard Model (SM) itself violates CP symmetry (e.g., in the weak interactions of quarks, described by the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it is not required to preserve a symmetry that the SM already breaks. In fact, many of the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT introduce new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). The CPT Theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that *must* be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
