    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the energy of interaction between an atom's magnetic dipole moment and an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect. The energy associated with this interaction is given by the expectation value of the Zeeman Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle H_Z \\right\\rangle$.\n\nThe Zeeman Hamiltonian is:\n$H_Z = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\vec{\\mu}$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment of the electron.\n*   $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu} = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H_Z = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe quantity $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is defined as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$. We can rewrite the Hamiltonian as:\n$H_Z = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = (0, 0, B)$. The dot product simplifies to:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThe energy of the interaction is the expectation value of the operator $H_Z$. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H_Z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) = m \\mu_B B$\n\n### **2. Calculate the Magnitude of the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Magnetic field, $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$.\n*   $m$ has \"small values\". We can take $m=1$ as a representative small, non-zero integer value to assess the order of magnitude.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$, is approximately $5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T})$\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately $10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The formula relating energy and wavelength is:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   Wavelength, $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$.\n\nA convenient formula for converting wavelength in nanometers to energy in electron-volts (eV) is:\n$\\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})}$\n\nPlugging in the value of the wavelength:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240}{486.1} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the transition energy is approximately $1 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n*Note: This wavelength, 486.1 nm, corresponds to the blue-green line in the Balmer series of the hydrogen atom (the transition from n=4 to n=2).*\n\n### **4. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Atomic transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is very small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\nTherefore, the relationship between them is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis confirms that the Zeeman splitting is a very small perturbation compared to the energy differences between principal electronic levels in an atom.\n\nFinal answer is **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
