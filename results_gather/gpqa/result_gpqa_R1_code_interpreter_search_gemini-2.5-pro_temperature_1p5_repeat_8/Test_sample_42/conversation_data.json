    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Molecule and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano group (-CN), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy group (-OCH3).\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these functional groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amine > Ether.\n    The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, so the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents Based on a Fixed Point:**\n    *   The problem states that a **methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid**. Since the -COOH group is at C1, the methoxy group (-OCH3) must be at **C4**.\n\n3.  **Place the Remaining Substituents Using the Given Relationships:**\n    *   A **hydroxyl group (-OH)** and a **dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2)** are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   A **carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a 'formyl' substituent)** and a **cyano group (-CN)** are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n    *   A key constraint is that the **methoxy group (at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (-CN)**.\n        *   Let's test where the nitrile (-CN) group can be. It must be at C3 or C5.\n        *   If the nitrile is at C5, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is indeed at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n        *   If the nitrile is at C3, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is indeed at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n    *   This gives us two possible arrangements. We need to use the IUPAC numbering rules to decide between them.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Break the Tie:**\n    The rule for numbering a substituted benzene ring (after assigning C1 to the principal functional group) is to number the ring to give the substituents the **lowest possible set of locants**. If a choice still remains, we give the lowest number to the substituent that comes **first alphabetically**.\n\n    Let's analyze the two possible structures:\n\n    *   **Structure 1:** Let's place the hydroxyl group at **C2** and the nitrile at **C3**.\n        *   C1: -COOH (Principal)\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   The remaining meta position, C5, must have the formyl group: **C5: -CHO** (formyl).\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must have the dimethylamino group: **C6: -N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino).\n        *   The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n    *   **Structure 2:** Let's place the hydroxyl group at **C6** and the nitrile at **C5**.\n        *   C1: -COOH (Principal)\n        *   C2: The remaining ortho position, C2, must have the dimethylamino group: **C2: -N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino).\n        *   C3: The remaining meta position, C3, must have the formyl group: **C3: -CHO** (formyl).\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n    Both structures give the same locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Now we must use the alphabetical order tie-breaker.\n\n5.  **Apply the Alphabetical Tie-Breaker Rule:**\n    *   First, list the substituent names in alphabetical order:\n        1.  **cyano**\n        2.  **dimethylamino** (the 'd' in dimethyl counts for alphabetization)\n        3.  **formyl**\n        4.  **hydroxy**\n        5.  **methoxy**\n    *   Now, compare the two structures based on the locant of the first substituent in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\").\n        *   In **Structure 1**, \"cyano\" is at position **3**.\n        *   In **Structure 2**, \"cyano\" is at position **5**.\n    *   The rule is to choose the numbering that gives the lower locant to the first point of difference. Since 3 < 5, **Structure 1 is the correctly numbered molecule**.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Using Structure 1, we assemble the name by listing the substituents alphabetically, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   Structure 1 positions: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   Alphabetical order: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy\n    *   Final Name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived name perfectly matches option C.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering based on the alphabetical tie-breaker.\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order of substituents.\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct**.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order of substituents.\n\n<<<C>>>"
