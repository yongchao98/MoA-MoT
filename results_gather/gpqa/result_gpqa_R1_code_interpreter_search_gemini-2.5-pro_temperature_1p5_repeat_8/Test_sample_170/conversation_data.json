    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This property determines the primary position of substitution for the incoming bromine atom.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating groups) or halogens (deactivating groups).\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position (one carbon away). They are electron-withdrawing groups and are deactivating.\n\nLet's classify the substituents for substances 1-6:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: -CH3 (methyl) is an alkyl group. It's an electron-donating group (activating) and thus an **ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**: -COOC2H5 (ester group) has a carbonyl C=O double bond conjugated with the ring. It is a strongly electron-withdrawing group (deactivating) and a **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: -Cl (chloro) is a halogen. Halogens are an exception: they are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating) but can donate lone-pair electrons via resonance, making them **ortho, para-directors**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: -NO2 (nitro) is a very strongly electron-withdrawing group (strongly deactivating) and a **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: -C2H5 (ethyl) is an alkyl group, similar to methyl. It is an activating **ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: -COOH (carboxyl group) has a carbonyl group. It's a strongly electron-withdrawing group (deactivating) and a **meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Separate substances into low and high para-yield groups.**\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two main groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors)**: Substances 2, 4, and 6 will primarily form the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be very small.\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho, para-directors)**: Substances 1, 3, and 5 will form a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The para-isomer is often the major product in this group.\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will start with substances {2, 4, 6} and end with substances {1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within the low para-yield (meta-directing) group.**\nThe substances are Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), and Ethyl benzoate (2). For these meta-directors, a small amount of para product is still formed. The more strongly the group deactivates the ring, the more pronounced the preference for meta-substitution is, and consequently, the lower the yield of the minor para product. We need to rank the deactivating strength of the substituents: -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n\n*   The **-NO2** group is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The **-COOH** and **-COOC2H5** groups are both strongly deactivating. The -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group because the ethyl group in the ester is weakly electron-donating, slightly reducing the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl.\n*   Deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nYield(-NO2) < Yield(-COOH) < Yield(-COOC2H5)\nThis corresponds to the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the high para-yield (ortho, para-directing) group.**\nThe substances are Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3). For these, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho product. The para product is generally favored over the ortho product due to steric hindrance.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position even more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Alkyls (1, 5) vs. -Cl (3)**: This comparison involves both steric and electronic effects.\n    *   Literature data for bromination shows that toluene (1) gives about 66% para-isomer.\n    *   Due to the reasoning above, ethylbenzene (5) will give a higher percentage, perhaps around 70-75%.\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3) gives an exceptionally high yield of the para-isomer, about 87%. This is because the strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the nearby ortho position more strongly than the distant para position, reinforcing the steric preference for the para position.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    Order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups.**\nNow, we combine the ordered low-yield group and the ordered high-yield group.\n\n(Low Yield Group) < (High Yield Group)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
