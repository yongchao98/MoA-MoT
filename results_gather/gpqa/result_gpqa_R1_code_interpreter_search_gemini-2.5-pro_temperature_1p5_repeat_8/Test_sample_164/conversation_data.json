    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The goal is to create a polyethylene polymer with \"regular branches\" using only ethylene as a reactant. This requires a specific type of dual-catalyst system, known as a tandem catalysis system.\n    *   **Catalyst 1:** Polymerizes ethylene. The initial experiment produces high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is linear.\n    *   **Catalyst 2:** Must perform an *in-situ* reaction to create the branches from ethylene. The only way to do this is to selectively oligomerize ethylene into a specific short alpha-olefin (a comonomer). For \"regular\" branches, this oligomer must be consistent, for example, the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene (which would create butyl branches).\n    *   The two catalyst systems must then work together in the same reactor, with Catalyst 1 incorporating the 1-hexene (made by Catalyst 2) into the growing polyethylene chain.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Statement A: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   The most successful and industrially relevant catalysts for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene are based on Chromium (Cr).\n    *   Chromium is a transition metal in Group 6 of the modern IUPAC periodic table. In the older American CAS system, this was Group VIB. In an even older European system, it was Group VIA.\n    *   However, under the modern IUPAC and standard CAS notation, Group VIA refers to Group 16 (the chalcogens: Oxygen, Sulfur, etc.). These are not transition metals and are not used as the central metal for this type of catalysis.\n    *   Therefore, based on standard, modern chemical nomenclature, this statement is technically incorrect. While the speaker likely *meant* Chromium (Group VIB/6), the statement as written is false.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Statement B: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   Noble metals include rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), iridium (Ir), and platinum (Pt).\n    *   Catalysts based on some of these metals have been shown to oligomerize ethylene. For instance, palladium and nickel (not noble, but related) are used in the Shell Higher Olefin Process (SHOP), but this process produces a broad distribution of different alpha-olefins, which would lead to *irregular*, not regular, branches.\n    *   Some research has shown that specific iridium or rhodium complexes can have selectivity for one oligomer (like 1-butene or 1-hexene), so technically they \"can be used\" in a lab. However, their selectivity and activity are generally inferior to the best chromium systems, making them impractical for producing truly \"regular\" branches. So, the premise that they are suitable for the specific task is weak.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is misleading and likely incorrect in the context of achieving *regular* branches.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Statement D: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene (e.g., trimerization to 1-hexene).\n    *   The premier catalysts for this reaction (e.g., chromium/pyrrole systems) almost universally require an activator, and the most common and effective activators are aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), and various trialkylaluminum compounds.\n    *   These activators are not just helpful; they are essential for the catalyst's function. The statement that they \"do not work\" is factually incorrect.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Statement C: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   This statement refers to tandem catalysis for producing branched polyethylene from ethylene.\n    *   This is a known, large-scale industrial process. The most prominent example is the process commercialized by Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, which operates in the US (e.g., in Baytown, Texas). Their technology uses a single reactor with a dual-catalyst system to trimerize ethylene to 1-hexene and then copolymerize the ethylene and 1-hexene to produce linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).\n    *   This statement is a verifiable and unambiguous fact.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Statement A is incorrect due to a critical error in chemical nomenclature.\n*   Statement B is incorrect because noble metal catalysts are generally not selective enough to produce the \"regular branches\" specified.\n*   Statement D is incorrect because aluminum-based activators are, in fact, essential for the key oligomerization catalysts.\n*   Statement C is a factually correct statement describing the current state of industrial chemistry.\n\nTherefore, statement C is the only correct one among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
