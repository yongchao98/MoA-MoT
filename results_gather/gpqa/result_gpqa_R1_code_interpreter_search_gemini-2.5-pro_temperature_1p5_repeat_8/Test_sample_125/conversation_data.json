    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a chiral molecule containing one stereocenter at carbon C-5, with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   The stereocenter at C-5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains (S).\n    *   Therefore, the products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   The two products have the configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). Since they have two stereocenters, and the configuration is the same at one center (C-5) but different at the other (C-3), they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   The reaction starts with a chiral compound, so the two diastereomers are generally formed in unequal amounts, but since the reaction goes to 100% completion, both will be present in the final mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketones are reduced.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reduction creates two new stereocenters at C-2 and C-4.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   With two stereocenters, there are up to 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, this enantiomeric pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts of each).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has chiral centers but is an achiral molecule overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound, just viewed differently.\n        *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The final mixture contains a total of **five** different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine the number of peaks observed on each type of HPLC column.\n\n**A) Normal-phase HPLC (achiral stationary phase):**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus different polarities. They **can be separated**.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S)) are diastereomers. They will be separated from each other. The two enantiomers, however, will elute together. This results in **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (chiral stationary phase):**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture can be resolved into a separate peak (assuming a suitable chiral column is used, which is the standard assumption in such problems).\n*   Let's count the peaks from the 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomer)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separated from its enantiomer)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomers)\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final analysis shows that there will be **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
