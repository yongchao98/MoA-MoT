    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the empirical and molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\nZ is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\nMass fraction of Hydrogen = (y × Ar(H)) / (x × Ar(C) + y × Ar(H)) = 0.1428\nLet's use the approximate atomic masses: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as y / (12x + y).\nSo, y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428\nThe value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\nLet's assume the mass fraction is exactly 1/7.\ny / (12x + y) = 1/7\n7y = 12x + y\n6y = 12x\ny = 2x\nThis means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n\nThe problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives only one substance, Z. This implies that all components in X and Y are based on the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   Z is a common solvent and a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's test this hypothesis.\n*   For cyclohexane (C6H12), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given 14.28%. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X, and its components do not decolorize bromine water. This means they are saturated or aromatic (aromatic rings do not react with bromine water under standard conditions).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let Y = {Z, D}.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (it's already saturated) and hydrogenation of D gives Z.\n*   Since D is in mixture Y, it does not decolorize bromine water (it's saturated or aromatic). For D to be hydrogenated to Z (cyclohexane), it must have the same C6 carbon skeleton. A saturated C6 isomer would be something like methylcyclopentane, which has a different skeleton. However, an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is benzene (C6H6). Benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   So, a very strong candidate for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\nLet's check if this fits the conditions for Y:\n1.  Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes.\n2.  Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, both cyclohexane (saturated) and benzene (aromatic) do not react with Br2 water.\n3.  Hydrogenation gives one substance Z: Hydrogenation of {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n4.  Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y: Yes.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X and the reaction.**\n\nThe reaction is the conversion of mixture X into mixture Y.\nX = {A, B} → Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}\nThe reaction is an equimolar disproportionation. A disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\nSince we start with an equimolar mixture X = {A, B} and end with an equimolar mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}, the reaction must be:\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)\n(in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n\nFor this to be a hydrogen transfer, one reactant must be reduced to cyclohexane, and the other must be oxidized to benzene.\n*   Reduction: C6Hx + 2H → C6H12 (cyclohexane). This implies the reactant has the formula C6H10. This is **cyclohexene**.\n*   Oxidation: C6Hy - 2H → C6H6 (benzene). This implies the reactant has the formula C6H8. This could be a **cyclohexadiene**.\n\nSo, mixture X is likely composed of cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\nThe overall reaction is:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nIn this reaction, cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (gets oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (gets reduced to cyclohexane). The hydrogen atoms are conserved (10 + 8 = 12 + 6).\n\nNow let's check if this choice for X fits all the given conditions:\n1.  Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes, cyclohexene and cyclohexadienes are liquids.\n2.  Decolorizes bromine water: Yes, both contain C=C double bonds.\n3.  Hydrogenation gives only Z (cyclohexane):\n    *   C6H10 + H2 → C6H12\n    *   C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12\n    This is true.\n4.  No conjugated multiple bonds: Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the component must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n\nThe model is fully consistent. Mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis number can also be found directly from the H-balance in Step 3, where the total H atoms in the reactants must equal the total H atoms in the products (12 + 6 = 18).\n\n<<<C>>>"
