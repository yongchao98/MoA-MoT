    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. These are characteristic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH2⁻), will abstract an acidic proton from the benzene ring. The most acidic protons are those *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's label the carbons for clarity: Bromine is on C1, and Deuterium (d or D) is on C2.\n        ```\n             Br\n            / \\\n          (C1)-(C2)D\n         //   \\\\\n       H(C6)   (C3)H\n        |     |\n       H(C5)---(C4)H\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        ```\n    *   The positions ortho to the bromine at C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   There are two possible protons (one is actually a deuteron) that can be removed by the base:\n        *   **Path A: Abstraction of the hydrogen (H) at C6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this abstraction is kinetically favored (a phenomenon known as the primary kinetic isotope effect). The base removes H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion at C6. This anion then expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   **Path B: Abstraction of the deuterium (D) at C2.** Although slower than Path A, this pathway is still possible. The base removes D⁺ from C2, creating a carbanion at C2. This anion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is the parent **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile is the amide ion (NH2⁻), which is present in the solution. It will attack the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between the original C1 and C6 carbons, and a deuterium on the original C2 carbon.\n        *   The nucleophile NH2⁻ can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks the carbon that was originally C1, the new C-N bond forms there. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks the carbon that was originally C6, the new C-N bond forms there. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is now at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   These two products, 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline, are distinct constitutional isomers.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate 2 (parent benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.\n        *   The nucleophile NH2⁻ can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond. Due to symmetry, this leads to the same intermediate anion.\n        *   This anion is then protonated by the solvent, NH3. Since the starting benzyne had no deuterium, and it is protonated by regular ammonia, the final product is simply **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    *   Based on the two possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, three distinct organic products can be formed:\n        1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Path A)\n        2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Path A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Path B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
