    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **pyran-2-one**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (pyran) and a carbonyl group at position 2, forming a lactone (a cyclic ester). The oxygen is at position 1.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group is attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   The structure is a delta-lactone (δ-lactone).\n*   The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, bonded to an ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different parts of the ring.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Identify the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxycarboxylic acids. A six-membered δ-lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\nThe precursor to `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\nLet's verify this:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\nThe hydroxyl group (-OH) on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) on C1. The resulting ring consists of atoms C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and the oxygen from the C5-OH group. This forms a six-membered ring. The chiral center at C3 of the acid becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone. The reaction does not affect the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained during lactonization.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's determine its structure:\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). The carboxyl carbon is C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) is at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This describes a substituent at C5. It's an isobutoxycarbonyl group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`, which is an isobutyl ester.\n*   Combining these parts, the structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-iBu(5)`.\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a chiral center at C3.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent**: `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does not readily reduce carboxylic acids (especially after deprotonation to the unreactive carboxylate salt).\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The reduction converts starting material A into `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate alkoxide and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction mechanism does not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent**: `BH₃` (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It is known for its high reactivity towards carboxylic acids, reducing them much faster than esters.\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  `BH₃` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COO-iBu`) at C5 remains largely unreacted under conditions where the acid is selectively reduced.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate hydroxy-ester: `HO-CH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-iBu(5)`. This is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    4.  The problem states that the final product is a 6-membered lactone, which means the final precursor must be `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. To get from the hydroxy-ester intermediate to this hydroxy-acid, the ester group must be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. This hydrolysis (`-COOiBu` → `-COOH`) occurs during the acidic workup (H⁺).\n    5.  The resulting `(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` then undergoes acid-catalyzed lactonization to form the final (S)-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: None of the steps in this proposed pathway (reduction of C1, hydrolysis of C5, lactonization) affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
