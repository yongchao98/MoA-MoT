    "Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's dissect its structure:\n- Benzene ring backbone.\n- Three adjacent substituents:\n    - Position 1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    - Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    - Position 3: nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relative positions are:\n- -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n- -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n- -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to create via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) methods because the directing effects of the groups often conflict with this desired arrangement.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para* director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position.\n- **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta* director.\n- **-NH2 (amino)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director. (Formed by reduction of -NO2).\n- **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director. (Precursor to -OEt).\n- **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta* director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Synthesis**\n\nLet's consider how to install these three adjacent groups. A direct three-step EAS is highly unlikely to work. For instance, if we have 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, both -OEt and -tBu direct incoming electrophiles (like -NO2) to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. This indicates that a more complex strategy involving functional group interconversions (like -NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt) or blocking groups is necessary.\n\nThe provided question and options are complex and appear to have typos (e.g., duplicated step numbers, strange ordering). This requires us to identify the most chemically sound pathway among the flawed choices. We will analyze each option by checking the validity of the reaction order.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's assume the question intends a single sequence of reactions and evaluate the chemical logic of each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `... ii) Fe/HCl ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; ... vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ...`\n    - Step v) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, which correctly follows the formation of an amine in step ii) `Fe/HCl`.\n    - However, step vi) attempts to sulfonate the resulting diazonium salt, which is not a standard or high-yield reaction. It's immediately followed by step vii) `dilute H2SO4`, which is used for *de*sulfonation. This sequence of sulfonation followed immediately by desulfonation is nonsensical. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    - Step iv) performs a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires an aniline (-NH2) functional group as a starting material.\n    - However, the reaction to form the aniline (reduction with `Fe/HCl`) only occurs much later in step viii). You cannot diazotize a molecule before forming the necessary amine. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    - Here, the amine formation (iv) is correctly placed before diazotization (v).\n    - However, step vi) attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt formed in step v). Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic procedure. Diazonium salts are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (Sandmeyer, Schiemann, hydrolysis, etc.). **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    - By elimination, this should be the correct answer. Let's analyze its sequence, acknowledging that the target molecule is likely a typo and that the last two steps (viii, ix) seem misplaced. Let's focus on the coherence of steps i through vii.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene -> *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (the *para* isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the *t*-butyl group).\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene -> *p*-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** *p*-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. The strong activating -NH2 group (often protected as -NHCOCH3 to prevent oxidation and control reactivity) directs the new -NO2 group to the position *ortho* to the amine. This yields 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The -NH2 group of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in acidic water, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is treated with base (NaOH) and an ethyl halide (EtBr) to form the corresponding ether: `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`.\n\n    This sequence (i-vii) is chemically logical and represents a valid multi-step synthesis. Although it produces a 1,2,4-substituted isomer (`1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`) instead of the named 1,2,3-isomer, it is the only option that does not contain fundamentally flawed reaction ordering. The inclusion of steps viii and ix is likely an error in the question's construction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain fatal errors in their reaction sequences, making them chemically impossible. Option B presents a coherent, albeit complex, synthetic route for the first seven steps. The inconsistencies (wrong final product name, extraneous final steps) suggest the question itself is flawed. However, in a multiple-choice scenario, the task is to find the *best* possible answer. By eliminating the chemically invalid options, Option B remains the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
