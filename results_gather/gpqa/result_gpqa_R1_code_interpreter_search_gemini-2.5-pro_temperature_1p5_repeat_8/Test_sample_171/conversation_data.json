    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem relates the population of atomic energy levels to temperature. This relationship is governed by the Boltzmann equation, which applies to systems in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), an assumption given in the problem.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state 'b' (population N_b) to a lower state 'a' (population N_a) is:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights of the states (constants for a given transition).\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:**\n    Let R_1 be the ratio of the populations for star_1 (temperature T_1) and R_2 be the ratio for star_2 (temperature T_2).\n    *   For star_1: R_1 = (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For star_2: R_2 = (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Use the Information Given in the Problem:**\n    The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to ... star_2\". This means the ratio of the excited state population to the lower state population is twice as large for star_1.\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Set up the Equation and Simplify:**\n    Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship R_1 = 2 * R_2:\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g_b / g_a) is the same for both stars since it's the same atomic transition, so it cancels out:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n6.  **Solve for the Relationship between Temperatures:**\n    To solve for T_1 and T_2, we need to isolate the temperature terms. Divide both sides by the exponential term containing T_2:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\n    Using the exponent rule e^a / e^b = e^(a-b):\n    exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\n    exp[ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\n    Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Use the Numerical Values Provided:**\n    The problem gives the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    The Boltzmann constant is a fundamental physical constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    The question asks for a general equation relating the temperatures, and the options do not contain ΔE or k. This implies we should use the given values to simplify the expression. Let's calculate the factor (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value (treating it as the number 1, as is common in such physics problems where the units are implicitly handled) into our derived equation:\n    1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived equation is: ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2) ]\n    This matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n\nThe correct equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
