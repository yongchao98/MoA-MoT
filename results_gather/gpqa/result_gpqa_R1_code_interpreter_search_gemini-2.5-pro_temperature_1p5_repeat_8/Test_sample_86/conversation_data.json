    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n    *   **Molecular Composition:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Core Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. A benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen atom directly bonded to the aromatic ring, Ar-X) is confirmed.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We start with the benzene ring (C6). This leaves 2 carbon atoms (8 total - 6 ring = 2) for the two substituents.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains no carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and simple chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these parts, the molecule must be a haloacetophenone. The chemical formula would be C8H7XO.\n\n3.  **Analyze Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents (halogen and acetyl group) can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   Let's consider the *para* isomer (p-haloacetophenone). Due to symmetry, the four protons on the aromatic ring are chemically equivalent in pairs. This results in a characteristic A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') splitting pattern in the 1H NMR spectrum, which typically appears as two distinct doublets. Each doublet would integrate to 2 protons (2H).\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which will deshield the adjacent aromatic protons (shift them downfield). Halogens are also electron-withdrawing but are pi-donors, so their effect is often less pronounced than a carbonyl group. The aromatic protons will appear in the typical range of δ 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, the methyl protons will appear as a sharp singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with). It will integrate to 3 protons (3H). Its typical chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   In summary, for *p*-haloacetophenone, we expect to see:\n        *   Two doublets in the aromatic region (e.g., ~δ 7.5-8.0 ppm), each for 2H.\n        *   One singlet in the aliphatic region (e.g., ~δ 2.3 ppm) for 3H.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic proton region (δ 7-8 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integrations and multiplicities are inconsistent with the proposed structure. A 2H singlet is not plausible. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic A₂B₂ pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration (2H + 2H = 4H aromatic protons) is correct. The chemical shifts are in the expected downfield region.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group. The chemical shift is also characteristic.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for *p*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This suggests the carbonyl group is an aldehyde. A possible structure could be 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, which has 8 carbons. However, this structure has a *benzylic*-halogen bond (Ar-CH₂-X), not the required *aromatic*-halogen bond (Ar-X). Another possibility, 4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde, has an Ar-X bond but would show different splitting patterns (the aldehyde and CH₂ protons would couple to each other, not be singlets). Thus, this option does not match the compound described.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only NMR data that is fully consistent with a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring containing 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
