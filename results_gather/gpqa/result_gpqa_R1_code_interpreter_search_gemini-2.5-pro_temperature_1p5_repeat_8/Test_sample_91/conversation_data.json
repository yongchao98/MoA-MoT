    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and types of bonds. The condensed formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break it down and draw the structure to determine the count of each type of atom and bond.\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH3                             CH3\n      |                               |\n(1)C=(2)CH-(3)CH2-(4)CH-(5)CH2-(6)CH=(7)C\n  / \\             |                   / \\\nCH3  CH3         (CH3)             CH3  CH3\n```\nThis is a nonadiene with several methyl substituents. Let's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** There are 7 carbons in the main chain and 5 carbons in the methyl (CH3) groups. Total C = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** There are 7 hydrogens on the main chain (1 on C2, 2 on C3, 1 on C4, 2 on C5, 1 on C6) and 5 methyl groups (5 * 3 = 15 H). Total H = 7 + 15 = 22.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Chemical Bonds**\n\nNow, we count each type of bond in one molecule:\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the chain (C1=C2 and C6=C7).\n    *   Count = **2**\n*   **C-C single bonds:**\n    *   Bonds within the main chain: C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. (4 bonds)\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the chain: 2 on C1, 1 on C4, 2 on C7. (5 bonds)\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9**\n*   **C-H single bonds:**\n    *   As calculated above, there are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom.\n    *   Total C-H bonds = **22**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nThe total bond energy (ΔH_bond_energy) is the energy required to break down one mole of the gaseous compound into its constituent gaseous atoms.\nC12H22(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\nUsing the given bond energies:\n*   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_bond_energy = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\nΔH_bond_energy = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_bond_energy = 8800 + 1800 + 600\n**ΔH_bond_energy = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The reaction is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of C, 11 moles of H2) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C, 22 moles of H). This is the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements (ΔH_atomization_elements).\n\nUsing the given data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C(s) -> C(g)) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H (H2(g) -> 2H(g)) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization_elements = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nΔH_atomization_elements = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atomization_elements = 12000 + 1100\n**ΔH_atomization_elements = 13100 kJ**\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements and the energy released when those atoms form the molecule.\nΔHf° = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the molecule)]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n**ΔHf° = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include values in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to these units.\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass ≈ (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol)\nΔHf° (kJ/g) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\nLet's execute a python script to verify the arithmetic.\n```python\n# Given values\nBE_CH = 400  # kJ/mol\nBE_CC_single = 200  # kJ/mol\nBE_CC_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nAtomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100  # kJ/mol\n\n# Counts based on the molecular formula C12H22 and its structure\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H / 2\n\n# Bond counts in the molecule\nnum_bonds_CH = 22\nnum_bonds_CC_single = 9\nnum_bonds_CC_double = 2\n\n# 1. Calculate the total bond energy of the molecule (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\ntotal_bond_energy_compound = (num_bonds_CH * BE_CH) + (num_bonds_CC_single * BE_CC_single) + (num_bonds_CC_double * BE_CC_double)\n\n# 2. Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the elements in their standard states\ntotal_atomization_energy_elements = (num_C * Atomization_C) + (num_H2_molecules * BE_HH)\n\n# 3. Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = total_atomization_energy_elements - total_bond_energy_compound\n\n# 4. Calculate the molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses)\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1)\n\n# 5. Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nenthalpy_of_formation_g = enthalpy_of_formation_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Total Bond Energy of Compound: {total_bond_energy_compound} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total Atomization Energy of Elements: {total_atomization_energy_elements} kJ\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_of_formation_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass of C12H22: {molar_mass_C12H22} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_of_formation_g}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nTotal Bond Energy of Compound: 11200 kJ/mol\nTotal Atomization Energy of Elements: 13100.0 kJ\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0 kJ/mol\nMolar Mass of C12H22: 166 g/mol\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation is confirmed. The enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which corresponds to 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect units, value is for kJ/mol)\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect)\nC) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the molecule, not the enthalpy of formation)\nD) 11.44 kJ/g (Correct)\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we follow these steps:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Counts**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the molecule to determine its molecular formula and the number of each type of chemical bond.\nThe structural formula is:\n```\n      CH3                             CH3\n      |                               |\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n      |\n      CH3\n```\n*   **Counting Carbon Atoms (C):**\n    *   There are 7 carbon atoms in the main chain.\n    *   There are 5 methyl (CH3) groups attached, which contain 5 carbon atoms.\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   **Counting Hydrogen Atoms (H):**\n    *   From the two (CH3)2C= groups: 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 H atoms.\n    *   From the =CH- group: 1 H atom.\n    *   From the -CH2- groups: 2 * 2 = 4 H atoms.\n    *   From the -CH(CH3)- group: 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H atoms.\n    *   From the =CH- group: 1 H atom.\n    *   Let's recount more systematically from the full structure: (CH3)2[C] + [C]H + CH2 + CH(CH3) + CH2 + CH + [C](CH3)2. This doesn't seem right.\n    *   Let's use the given condensed formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Number of carbons: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from C) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n    *   Number of hydrogens: (2 * 3) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + (2 * 3) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   **Counting Bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure has two double bonds (`C=C`). So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds involving carbon can be calculated. The sum of valencies for 12 carbons is 12 * 4 = 48. This must equal 2*(No. C-C bonds) + 2*(No. C=C bonds) + (No. C-H bonds).\n        Let x = number of C-C bonds.\n        48 = 2*x + 2*2 + 22\n        48 = 2x + 4 + 22\n        48 = 2x + 26\n        2x = 22\n        x = 11. Let's re-verify by counting.\n        Bonds in chain: C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. (4 bonds)\n        Bonds to methyls: 2 on C1, 1 on C4, 2 on C7. (5 bonds)\n        Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n        Let's re-check the valency calculation:\n        48 = 2*(No. of C-bonds) = 2*(No. of C-C) + 2*(No. of C=C) + (No. of C-H)\n        No, that's not right. Each bond connects two atoms. Total bonds = (Sum of Valencies)/2.\n        For C12H22, total bonds = (12*4 + 22*1)/2 = (48+22)/2 = 35 bonds.\n        Total bonds = (No. C-C) + (No. C=C) + (No. C-H)\n        35 = (No. C-C) + 2 + 22\n        No. C-C = 35 - 24 = 11. There seems to be a discrepancy in the bond count. Let's draw it fully.\n\n      CH3   H   H   CH3 H   H   H   CH3\n       \\   /   |   |    \\   /   |   /\n        C = C - C - C -- C = C -- C - CH3\n       /       |   |           /\n      CH3      H   H          CH3\n      Something is wrong with my drawing based on the name.\n      Let's re-examine the name: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n      This name appears non-standard. A standard IUPAC name would be something like 2,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2,6-nonadiene. Let's assume the condensed formula is correct.\n      Structure:\n          CH3                                 CH3\n          |                                   |\n      1.C = 2.CH - 3.CH2 - 4.CH - 5.CH2 - 6.CH = 7.C\n      |   |                |               |   |\n      CH3 H                CH3             H   CH3\n\n      Let's recount based on this depiction.\n      Carbons: C1 has 2 CH3. C4 has 1 CH3. C7 has 2 CH3. Total Carbons = 7 chain + 5 methyl = 12 C. Correct.\n      Hydrogens: 2*3 (on C1's methyls) + 1 (on C2) + 2 (on C3) + 1 (on C4) + 3 (on C4's methyl) + 2 (on C5) + 1 (on C6) + 2*3 (on C7's methyls) = 6+1+2+1+3+2+1+6 = 22 H. Correct.

Correct.\n      C=C double bonds: 1 (C1=C2) + 1 (C6=C7). Total = 2 C=C bonds. Correct.\n      C-H single bonds: 22. Correct.\n\nMy initial bond counts were correct.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Enthalpy Change for Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\n*   **Atomization of Carbon:** 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **Atomization of Hydrogen:** 11 mol * Bond Energy(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements (ΔH_atom_elements):** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy Change for Bond Formation of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms form the product molecule. It is numerically equal to the total bond energy of the molecule (with an opposite sign). We calculate the total bond energy required to break the molecule into atoms (ΔH_atom_compound).\nC12H22(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy (ΔH_atom_compound):** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the energy required to atomize the elements minus the energy released when the product is formed (which is the same as the total bond energy of the product).\nΔHf° = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]\nΔHf° = ΔH_atom_elements - ΔH_atom_compound\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. We must check which one matches. Our calculated value of 1900 kJ/mol does not match any options directly with those units. Option A has the right number but wrong units. Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Mass = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nComparing our results to the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect units)\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect value)\nC) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy, not enthalpy of formation)\nD) 11.44 kJ/g (Matches our calculation)\n\n<<<D>>>"
