    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to place a single bromine atom on the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the Favorskii rearrangement. An α-halo ketone with an acidic proton on the other α-carbon, when treated with a strong base like NaOH, can undergo a ring contraction. The base abstracts the acidic α'-proton (from C6) to form an enolate. The enolate then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl group, and the resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses by breaking the bond between the original carbonyl carbon and the α'-carbon, leading to a ring-contracted carboxylate.\n*   **Product 2:** After protonation during workup, the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   *Note:* An alternative reaction is E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the next reaction step strongly points towards the Favorskii rearrangement being the intended pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl<sub>2</sub>) and pyridine**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl atom. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction confirms that Product 2 must have been a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)<sub>3</sub>)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reduction reaction. LiAlH(OtBu)<sub>3</sub> is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes and stop the reaction at that stage, preventing over-reduction to the primary alcohol. This is known as the Rosenmund reduction using a hydride source.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of unique proton environments in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by considering the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Structure:** A five-membered ring (cyclopentane) is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n2.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n3.  **Analysis of Hydrogen Environments:**\n    *   **The Aldehyde Proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. That's **1** distinct type.\n    *   **The Methine Proton (on C1):** The single proton on the carbon atom to which the aldehyde is attached (C1) is also unique. That's a **2nd** distinct type.\n    *   **The α-Protons (on C2 and C5):** Due to the plane of symmetry, the C2 position is equivalent to the C5 position. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic because they are on a methylene group adjacent to a prochiral center (C1). This means they are chemically non-equivalent. The same applies to C5. The symmetry means that one proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5, and the other proton on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5. This gives two more sets of protons. That's a **3rd** and **4th** distinct type.\n    *   **The β-Protons (on C3 and C4):** Similarly, the C3 position is equivalent to the C4 position by symmetry. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic because of their fixed spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule. This gives two more distinct types of protons. That's a **5th** and **6th** distinct type.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSumming up the distinct types of hydrogens:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (α-protons) + 2 (β-protons) = 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
