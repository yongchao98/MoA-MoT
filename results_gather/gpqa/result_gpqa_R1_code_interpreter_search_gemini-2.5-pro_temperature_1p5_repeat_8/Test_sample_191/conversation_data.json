    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. We need to find the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of electrostatics for conductors:**\n    *   In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk of a conductor must be zero.\n    *   This principle leads to charge redistribution.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):**\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   Since the electric field is zero everywhere inside the conductor, the electric flux through this Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$), if the flux is zero, the total charge enclosed by the surface must be zero.\n    *   The charge enclosed is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($Q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $+q + Q_{inner} = 0$, which implies that the total charge induced on the inner surface is $Q_{inner} = -q$.\n    *   This induced charge $-q$ arranges itself on the inner surface to perfectly cancel the field produced by the $+q$ charge for all points outside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   The total charge of an isolated conductor is conserved. Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, a corresponding charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain overall neutrality.\n    *   This charge, $Q_{outer} = +q$, moves to the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   A key concept here is electrostatic shielding (the Faraday cage effect). The conductor's bulk shields the outer surface from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$).\n    *   Therefore, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the cavity or the position of the charge within the cavity.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges, the $+q$ charge will distribute itself *uniformly* over the surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The total electric field at point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges: the original charge $+q$, the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   However, due to the shielding effect, the net electric field produced by the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is zero everywhere *outside* the conductor.\n    *   Thus, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n7.  **Apply the Shell Theorem:**\n    *   The Shell Theorem states that the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution (like our uniform charge on the outer sphere) is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance $L$ from point P.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ is extraneous and intended to distract. The fundamental principles of electrostatic shielding simplify the problem significantly. The correct expression for the electric field at P depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P ($L$).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - This matches our derivation.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
