    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Decay Law:**\n    The number of particles, `N`, that remain undecayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ₀)`\n    where:\n    *   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n    *   `τ₀` is the *proper mean lifetime* of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    *   `t` is the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    The particles are moving at relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). The time experienced by the particles (`t_proper`) is different from the time measured in the lab (`t_lab`). This is due to time dilation:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate Travel Time in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall.\n    *   Distance, `R` = 30 m.\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    *   The time taken to reach the wall in the lab frame is:\n        `t_lab = Distance / Speed ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Calculate Travel Time in the Particle's Frame:**\n    We need to find the time that passes in the particle's own reference frame during its journey to the wall. We can rearrange the time dilation formula:\n    `t_proper = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (c * γ)`\n\n5.  **Combine Decay and Relativity:**\n    Now we can substitute the proper time (`t_proper`) into the decay equation to find the fraction of particles (`N/N₀`) that survive the trip to the detector wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t_proper / τ₀) = exp(- (R / (c * γ)) / τ₀)`\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n\n6.  **Analyze the Given Conditions:**\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    `K = R / (c * τ₀)`\n    So the equation simplifies to:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    We are given two scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, and the fraction of particles reaching the wall is `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** The fraction of particles reaching the wall is `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`, and we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    We can solve this system of two equations. First, let's find the constant `K` from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, substitute this value of `K` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Multiply both sides by -1:\n    `ln(3) - ln(2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Finally, rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of gamma_2 using the derived formula\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n> 실행 결과:\n> 54.18986216834316\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.2.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 28\nC) 68\nD) 54\n\nThe calculated value of ~54.2 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning for this problem involves the interplay between relativistic time dilation and exponential decay.\n\n1.  **Particle Decay and Survival Fraction:**\n    The fraction of particles that survive after a time `t` in their own reference frame (proper time, `t_p`) is given by the formula:\n    `Fraction surviving = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ₀)`\n    where `τ₀` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:**\n    The particles are moving at a high velocity relative to the detector (the lab frame). The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the time experienced by the particle (`t_p`) due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_p` or `t_p = t_lab / γ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector, a distance `R = 30` meters. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    The time taken in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = Distance / Speed ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combining the Concepts:**\n    We can substitute the expressions for time into the decay formula. The proper time experienced by the particle during its flight is:\n    `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n    So, the survival fraction becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-[R / (γ * c)] / τ₀) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Using the Given Information:**\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this particle and detector. Let's call it `A`.\n    The survival fraction is `N/N₀ = exp(-A / γ)`.\n\n    We are given two scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** When `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-A / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which the survival fraction is `2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-A / γ₂)`\n\n6.  **Solving for `γ₂`:**\n    First, we solve for the constant `A` using the information from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -A / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -A / 20`\n    `A = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, we use this value of `A` in the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -A / γ₂`\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Using the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this with the given options, the closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
