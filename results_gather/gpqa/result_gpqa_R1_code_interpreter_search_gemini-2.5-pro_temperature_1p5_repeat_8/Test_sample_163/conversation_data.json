    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses, M1 / M2.\n\n### 1. Identify the relevant physical principles and formulas\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i) )\n\nwhere:\n*   `M` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". This is a crucial piece of information. For an eclipse to occur, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees.\nWhen `i` = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin^3(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass formula significantly:\n\nM ≈ (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3\n\n### 2. Set up the mass ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n\nM1 = (P1 / (2 * π * G)) * (K1a + K1b)^3\nM2 = (P2 / (2 * π * G)) * (K2a + K2b)^3\n\nNow, let's divide M1 by M2:\n\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 / (2 * π * G)) * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ (P2 / (2 * π * G)) * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]\n\nThe term `1 / (2 * π * G)` is a constant and cancels out, leaving:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) )^3\n\n### 3. Substitute the given values\n\nLet's plug in the values for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1a = 10 km/s\n*   K1b = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities: K1_total = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2a = 15 km/s\n*   K2b = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities: K2_total = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow substitute these into the ratio formula. Note that the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) will cancel out, so no conversion is needed.\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)^3\n\n### 4. Calculate the final result\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation using a simple script.\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_total = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_total = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio M1 / M2\n# Ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation gives a result of 0.432.\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)^3 = 2 * (3 / 5)^3 = 2 * (0.6)^3 = 2 * 0.216 = 0.432\n\n### 5. Compare with the options\n\nThe calculated mass ratio M1 / M2 is approximately 0.432. Let's compare this to the given choices:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.7\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2, denoted as M1/M2.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics Principles:** The problem involves binary stars with known orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. This is a classic application of Kepler's Third Law as applied to spectroscopic binary systems. The formula for the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is:\n\n    M_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)\n\n    where:\n    *   `M_total` is the total mass of the binary system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the observer's line of sight.\n\n3.  **Analyze Key Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". This is a critical piece of information. For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees.\n    *   If i ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    *   Consequently, sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n    *   This greatly simplifies the mass formula to: M_total ≈ (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n4.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio M1 / M2.\n    *   For system 1: M1 ≈ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1a + K1b)³\n    *   For system 2: M2 ≈ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2a + K2b)³\n\n    Now, let's form the ratio M1 / M2:\n    M1 / M2 = [ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1a + K1b)³ ] / [ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2a + K2b)³ ]\n\n    The constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving a simpler expression for the ratio:\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n    Plugging these values into the ratio formula:\n    M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * [ (15) / (25) ]³\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** The calculation was performed using the python script.\n    *   `mass_ratio = (2.0 / 1.0) * ((10.0 + 5.0) / (15.0 + 10.0))**3`\n    *   `mass_ratio = 2 * (15 / 25)**3`\n    *   `mass_ratio = 2 * (0.6)**3`\n    *   `mass_ratio = 2 * 0.216`\n    *   `mass_ratio = 0.432`\n\n    The code output `0.43199999999999994` is the floating-point representation of this result.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio M1/M2 is ~0.432. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.6\n    B) ~ 1.2\n    C) ~ 0.7\n    D) ~ 0.4\n\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
