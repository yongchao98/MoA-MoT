    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum representation as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total orbital angular momentum operator $L^2$ (with eigenvalue $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(3)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$) and the total z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ (with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$).\n\n2.  **Identify the desired final state:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n    *   We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   This corresponds to the system collapsing into the eigenstate $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$, where $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$. Let's call this the final state.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of quantum measurement:**\n    *   According to the Born rule, the probability of obtaining a specific outcome is the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final state corresponding to that outcome.\n    *   Probability $P = |< \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} >|^2$.\n    *   In our case, $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use conservation of the z-component of angular momentum:**\n    *   The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with quantum number $m = -1$, so its eigenvalue is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. We can find its eigenvalue:\n        $L_z |1, -1; 1, -1> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |1, -1; 1, -1> = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar) |1, -1; 1, -1> = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |1, -1; 1, -1> = -2\\hbar |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n    *   So, the final state has a total z-component quantum number $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = -2$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the inner product:**\n    *   We have two states, the initial state and the final state, which are both eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator, $L_z$.\n    *   The initial state has eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state has eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n    *   A fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, the inner product of the initial state and the final state must be zero:\n        $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   The probability is the square of the magnitude of this inner product.\n    *   $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:** It is impossible to measure the individual z-components as $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ if the system is in a state with a total z-component of $m = -1$. This is because the sum of the individual components must equal the total ($m_1 + m_2 = m$). In this case, $-1 + (-1) = -2 \\neq -1$. Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is zero.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
