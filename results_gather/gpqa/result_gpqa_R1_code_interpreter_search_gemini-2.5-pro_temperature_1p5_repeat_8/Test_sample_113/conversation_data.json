    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    2.  **Reactants:** Butan-2-one (a ketone) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    3.  **Mechanism:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a strong nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   Step 1: CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n    4.  **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product. This requires a source of protons (H⁺).\n        *   Step 2: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    5.  **Identifying Reagent A:** The source of H⁺ is an acid. H₃O⁺ represents an acidic aqueous solution, typically used in a workup step after the initial reaction. NaHSO₃ is a reagent used for forming bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones, not for this step of cyanohydrin formation. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Reaction Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base upon heating.\n        *   R-C≡N + 2 H₂O → R-COOH + NH₃\n    3.  **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n    4.  **Identifying Reagent B:** The options for B are a strong acid (HCl) and a weak acid (CH₃COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis requires harsh conditions, meaning heating with either a strong acid or a strong base. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is generally not effective for this transformation. A strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a standard and effective reagent for acid-catalyzed nitrile hydrolysis. Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   Reagent A should be H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B should be HCl.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
