    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates that there are two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, the number of protons represented by each singlet must be equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. All signals are singlets, which means there is no splitting between adjacent protons. This suggests the alkyl groups are methyl groups (or other groups with no adjacent protons, like t-butyl, but methyl fits the formula).\n\n**2. Analyze the structures and expected 1H NMR spectra of the possible compounds:**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the molecular formula for all options.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. All three fit.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C6+4 H4+10 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\nNow, let's predict the spectrum for each compound individually, focusing on the number of signals and their integration, based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. This makes C1 and C3 equivalent, and C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes C1 and C4 equivalent, C2 and C3 equivalent, and H5 and H6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The CH2 group would be a **quartet** and the CH3 group would be a **triplet**. The problem states all signals are singlets, so this compound can be immediately ruled out. This eliminates option A.\n\n**3. Evaluate the remaining options as a 1:1 mixture:**\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has **two** aromatic singlets and **three** aliphatic singlets. Since each pure tetramethylbenzene isomer gives only one aromatic singlet, a mixture of any two of them will produce two aromatic singlets (assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, which is a safe bet). Since the mixture is 1:1 and each aromatic signal comes from 2 protons, the 1:1 integration ratio in the aromatic region is satisfied by any pair. The deciding factor is the aliphatic region.\n\nLet's check the combination of aliphatic signals for each option.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would produce a total of four aliphatic signals, unless some accidentally overlap. To get three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would need to overlap perfectly to form a single 6H signal. This would result in signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H (from overlap), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. While possible, it requires an assumption of accidental overlap.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would produce a total of five aliphatic signals. To get three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, significant and multiple accidental overlaps would be required. This is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   Combined, this mixture naturally produces **three aliphatic singlets**.\n    *   The integration of these signals would be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of integration is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This matches the experimental data perfectly without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly accounts for the observed number of signals and integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
