    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n*   We have a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.\n*   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ (a spectator ion) and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates completely into 2 Na+ (spectator ions), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water molecules.\n*   The primary components influencing the pH are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). This constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Moles and Concentrations**\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- and then their concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   **Moles of H2PO4- (from KH2PO4):**\n    *   Molar Mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4·2H2O):**\n    *   Molar Mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Concentrations:**\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**\nThe pH of the solution is controlled by the equilibrium between the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- pair, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n\nH2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\nKa2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻] = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO4^3-] Concentration**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\nKa3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻] = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n\n[PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we substitute the values we've calculated. Since Ka3 is extremely small, the equilibrium concentration of [HPO4^2-] is virtually identical to its initial concentration.\n\n[PO4³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n\nTo avoid rounding errors, we can perform the full calculation with a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# 1. Calculate moles\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# 2. Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume\n\n# 3. Calculate hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_conc = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# 4. Calculate orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\npo4_3_minus_conc = ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{po4_3_minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n executing the code...\n```text\n6.24e-07\n```\nThe calculation yields a concentration of 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M for the orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻).\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution**:\n    *   KH₂PO₄ is a salt that completely dissociates in water to form K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ ions. K⁺ is a spectator ion.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is a hydrated salt that dissolves in water to form 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ ions, and water. Na⁺ is a spectator ion.\n    *   The key species for the pH and equilibrium calculations are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).\n\n2.  **Recognize the buffer system**:\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ is a weak acid, and HPO₄²⁻ is its conjugate base. Together, they form a buffer solution.\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components**:\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄:\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n\n4.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components**:\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 200.00 mL = 0.200 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻:\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]**:\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₂:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n6.  **Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻]**:\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₃:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Substitute the known values. Since Ka₃ is very small, we can assume the equilibrium concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] is approximately equal to its initial concentration (0.02809 M).\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe code execution confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of `6.24e-07` M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
