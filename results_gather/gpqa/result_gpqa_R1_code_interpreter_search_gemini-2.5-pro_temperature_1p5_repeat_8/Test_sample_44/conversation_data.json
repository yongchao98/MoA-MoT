    "This problem involves determining the energy levels for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels for this potential are given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$  where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Quantum State:** For a particle in this system, the complete quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines its energy level) and its spin projection quantum number $m_s$ (which can be +1/2 for \"spin-up\" or -1/2 for \"spin-down\").\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### **2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nLet's list the energies of the lowest few single-particle states in terms of E:\n*   n = 1: $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   n = 2: $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   n = 3: $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   n = 4: $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n\n### **3. Calculation of System Energies**\n\nTo find the total energy of the system, we sum the energies of all four particles.\n\n**a) Ground State Energy (Lowest Total Energy)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all four particles are placed.\n*   **Energy Level n=1:** This is the lowest energy level ($1E$). We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Energy Level n=2:** This is the next lowest level ($4E$). We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total ground state energy ($E_{ground}$) is the sum of the energies of the occupied states:\n$E_{ground}$ = (2 particles in n=1) + (2 particles in n=2)\n$E_{ground}$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (2 * $E_2$)\n$E_{ground}$ = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**b) First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   New configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st}$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (1 * $E_2$) + (1 * $E_3$)\n$E_{1st}$ = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**c) Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\nLet's analyze the energy increase ($\\Delta E$) for different single-particle promotions from the ground state configuration (2 in n=1, 2 in n=2):\n\n1.  **Promote 1 particle from n=2 to n=3:**  $\\Delta E = E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E$.\n    Total Energy = 10E + 5E = 15E. (This is the 1st excited state).\n2.  **Promote 1 particle from n=1 to n=3:** $\\Delta E = E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E$.\n    Total Energy = 10E + 8E = **18E**. (Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n3.  **Promote 2 particles from n=2 to n=3:** $\\Delta E = 2(E_3 - E_2) = 2(5E) = 10E$.\n    Total Energy = 10E + 10E = 20E. (Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3).\n4.  **Promote 1 particle from n=2 to n=4:** $\\Delta E = E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E$.\n    Total Energy = 10E + 12E = 22E. (Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n\nComparing the total energies of these excited configurations (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (first excited state) and the second lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy ($E_{2nd}$) is **18E**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
