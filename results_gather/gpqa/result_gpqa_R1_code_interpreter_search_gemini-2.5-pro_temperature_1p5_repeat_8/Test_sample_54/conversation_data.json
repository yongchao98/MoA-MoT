    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm.**\n    *   The signal at **2.1 ppm** has an integration of **3H** (three protons) and is a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   A singlet means these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   A chemical shift around 2.1 ppm for a 3H singlet is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the signals in the alkene region (5-8 ppm) and the coupling constant.**\n    *   There are two signals in this region: **7.0 ppm** and **5.5 ppm**. These are the two vinylic protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a **doublet (d)** with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemistry.\n        *   A **trans** arrangement typically results in a large coupling constant, J = 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement results in a smaller coupling constant, J = 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed J value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the trans range. This strongly indicates that the two protons on the double bond are **trans** to each other.\n    *   This finding immediately eliminates the *cis* isomers: (B) Cis-propenyl acetate and (C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Distinguish between Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate based on the remaining signals.**\n    *   We are left with two options: (A) Trans-butenyl acetate and (D) Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze their expected structures and NMR signals.\n    *   **Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:** CH₃-C(=O)O-CH=CH-CH₃\n    *   **Structure of Trans-butenyl acetate (1-butenyl isomer):** CH₃-C(=O)O-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the splitting patterns to determine the full structure.**\n    *   Let's analyze the remaining signals from the provided data:\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the second vinylic proton. The multiplicity is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means the proton is being split by two different sets of neighbors: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This matches the `=CH-CH₃` fragment perfectly. The proton (`=CH-`) is split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton and into a quartet by the adjacent methyl (`-CH₃`) group.\n        *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is for three protons and is a **doublet (d)**. This indicates a methyl group (`CH₃`) that is adjacent to a single proton (`-CH-`). This is consistent with the methyl group in the `=CH-CH₃` fragment.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the observed data with the expected signals for the remaining options.**\n    *   **For Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃):**\n        *   CH₃-COO: singlet (matches 2.1 ppm signal).\n        *   -O-CH=: doublet (split by the other vinylic H) and very downfield due to the adjacent oxygen (matches 7.0 ppm signal).\n        *   =CH-CH₃: doublet of quartets (split by the other vinylic H and the methyl group) (matches 5.5 ppm signal).\n        *   =CH-CH₃: doublet (split by the adjacent vinylic H) (matches 1.6 ppm signal).\n        *   The observed data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    *   **For Trans-butenyl acetate (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   This structure contains an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) instead of a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n        *   It would show a signal for a CH₂ group (a multiplet) and a CH₃ group that is a triplet (split by the adjacent CH₂ group).\n        *   The provided data has no triplet signal and has a methyl signal that is a doublet, not a triplet. Therefore, this structure is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound that matches all aspects of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and coupling constant) is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
