    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial Mass: M\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300$ GeV.\n    *   Initial momentum: $p_{initial} = 0$.\n\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments produced by spontaneous fission.\n    *   Let the rest masses of the fragments be $m_1$ and $m_2$. Let $m_1$ be the more massive fragment.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n    *   The fragments will have kinetic energies $T_1$ and $T_2$ and momenta $\\vec{p}_1$ and $\\vec{p}_2$.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$\n\nNow, find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M$\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies. We know $Mc^2 = 300$ GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (more massive): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times Mc^2 = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (less massive): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times Mc^2 = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest-mass energy}) - (\\text{Final rest-mass energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n$T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### 4. Calculating T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nWe use the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero.\n$\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = 0 \\implies \\vec{p}_1 = -\\vec{p}_2$\nThis means the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   $T_{1, cl} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$\n*   $T_{2, cl} = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$\n\nTaking the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n$\\frac{T_{1, cl}}{T_{2, cl}} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$\n\nSince $m_1 = 2m_2$, the ratio is $\\frac{1}{2}$. So, $T_{2, cl} = 2T_{1, cl}$.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n$T_{1, cl} + T_{2, cl} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, cl} + 2T_{1, cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_{1, cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nSo, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 1 GeV.\n\n### 5. Calculating T1 using Relativistic Formulas\n\nWe again use conservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$). The relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass ($mc^2$) is:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n\nFrom this, we can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since the momenta are equal:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n\nWe also use the conservation of total energy. The total energy before ($Mc^2$) equals the total energy after ($E_1 + E_2$).\n$E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\nSo, $E_2 = Mc^2 - E_1$.\n\nSubstitute this into the momentum equation:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2)^2 - 2E_1(Mc^2) + E_1^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n\nThe $E_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$-(m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2)^2 - 2E_1(Mc^2) - (m_2c^2)^2$\n\nNow, solve for $E_1$:\n$2E_1(Mc^2) = (Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1 = \\frac{(Mc^2)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2}{2(Mc^2)}$\n\nPlug in the energy values we found earlier:\n$E_1 = \\frac{(300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2}{2 \\times 300}$\n$E_1 = \\frac{90000 + 39204 - 9801}{600}$\n$E_1 = \\frac{119403}{600} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy $E_1$ minus the rest-mass energy $m_1c^2$:\n$T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2$\n$T_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 6. Finding the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value of $T_1$ and the classical approximation.\n\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1, cl}$\nDifference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nFinally, convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's run a simple python script.\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nE0 = 300\n\n# Fragment rest-mass energies in GeV\nm1c2 = 0.66 * E0  # More massive fragment\nm2c2 = 0.33 * E0  # Less massive fragment\n\n# Total released kinetic energy (Q-value) in GeV\nQ = E0 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Classical calculation for T1 in GeV\n# From conservation of momentum, T1_cl/T2_cl = m2/m1 = 1/2\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q  => T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q => T1_cl = Q / 3\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1 in GeV\n# Total energy of the first fragment\nE1_relativistic = (E0**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2 * E0)\n# Kinetic energy of the first fragment\nT1_relativistic = E1_relativistic - m1c2\n\n# Difference in GeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n\n```\n executing the code ...\n- execution_code:\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nE0 = 300\n\n# Fragment rest-mass energies in GeV\nm1c2 = 0.66 * E0  # More massive fragment\nm2c2 = 0.33 * E0  # Less massive fragment\n\n# Total released kinetic energy (Q-value) in GeV\nQ = E0 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Classical calculation for T1 in GeV\n# From conservation of momentum, T1_cl/T2_cl = m2/m1 = 1/2\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q  => T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = Q => T1_cl = Q / 3\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1 in GeV\n# Total energy of the first fragment\nE1_relativistic = (E0**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2 * E0)\n# Kinetic energy of the first fragment\nT1_relativistic = E1_relativistic - m1c2\n\n# Difference in GeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\n- execution_log:\n```text\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n```\nThe python code confirms the manual calculations.

    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300$ GeV.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. We are given:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$ (fragment 1 is the more massive one).\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n\nFirst, let's find the rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ in terms of M.\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M$.\n\nNow, let's express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy:\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 - 297 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Calculating T1 (classical approximation):**\nBy conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n*   $T_{1,cl} = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_{2,cl} = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n$T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Calculating T1 (relativistic):**\nWe again use conservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$). The relativistic relationship between total energy E, momentum p, and rest-mass m is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\nThis means $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$. Since the momenta are equal:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n\nConservation of total energy states that the initial energy equals the final total energy:\n$Mc^2 = E_1 + E_2$.\nSo, $E_2 = Mc^2 - E_1 = 300 \\text{ GeV} - E_1$.\n\nSubstitute this into the momentum equation:\n$E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (Mc^2 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$E_1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (99)^2$\n$E_1^2 - 39204 = (300^2 - 2 \\times 300 \\times E_1 + E_1^2) - 9801$\n$E_1^2 - 39204 = 90000 - 600 E_1 + E_1^2 - 9801$\n\nThe $E_1^2$ terms cancel. Rearranging to solve for $E_1$:\n$600 E_1 = 90000 - 9801 + 39204$\n$600 E_1 = 119403$\n$E_1 = \\frac{119403}{600} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe correct (relativistic) kinetic energy $T_1$ is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n$T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Difference:**\nThe difference is $T_1 - T_{1,cl}$.\nDifference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\nDifference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
