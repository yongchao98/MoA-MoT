    "The user is asking to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions (Ca^2+) from a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex (let's denote it as CaY^2-) is formed from the reaction between calcium ions (Ca^2+) and the EDTA ligand (Y^4-). The formation reaction is:\n    Ca^2+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY^2-\n\n2.  **Formation Constant (K_f):** The problem provides the formation constant (also known as the stability constant) for this complex, K_Ca-EDTA or K_f.\n    K_f = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n\n3.  **Dissociation Reaction:** We are starting with the complex, so it will dissociate to reach equilibrium. The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n4.  **Dissociation Constant (K_d):** The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10^10) = 2 x 10^-11\n\n5.  **ICE Table:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| CaY^2-      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca^2+       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y^4-        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n6.  **Equilibrium Expression:** Now we write the equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction using the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table.\n    K_d = ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) / [CaY^2-]\n    2 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n7.  **Approximation:** The formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10), which means the complex is very stable and will not dissociate much. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n8.  **Solve for x:**\n    2 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ (2 x 10^-11) * (2 x 10^-2)\n    x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n    x = sqrt(4 x 10^-13)\n    To make the exponent even for an easier square root, we can write it as:\n    x = sqrt(40 x 10^-14)\n    x = sqrt(40) x 10^-7\n    Since sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7, sqrt(40) is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is equal to x.\nTherefore, [Ca^2+] ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\nLet's use a Python script to calculate the exact value for confirmation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the complex\nC_complex = 0.02  # M\n\n# Formation constant\nKf = 5e10\n\n# The equilibrium equation is x^2 / (C_complex) = 1/Kf\n# where x is the concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n# x^2 = C_complex / Kf\nx_squared = C_complex / Kf\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that x is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 6.3x10^-7 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex (let's denote it as CaY²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n2.  **Write the Dissociation Reaction:**\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:**\n    The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the reaction Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻.\n    K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ formed at equilibrium.\n\n| Species   | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| CaY²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺      | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y⁴⁻       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression for Dissociation:**\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻]\n    Substituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:**\n    Because the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This means the complex is very stable and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can assume that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n7.  **Solve for x:**\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to 'x'.\n    [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution (6.32e-07). Comparing this calculated value to the given options, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
