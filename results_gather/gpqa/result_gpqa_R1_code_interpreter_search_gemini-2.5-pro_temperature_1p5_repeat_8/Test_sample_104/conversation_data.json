    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Brightness Variation due to Spots:**\n    The star's brightness varies because of its rotation. When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the star appears brightest. When the hemisphere with dark, cool spots faces the observer, the star appears dimmest. The amplitude of this variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, relative to the maximum brightness.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Maximum Flux (F_max):**\n    The flux from a star is proportional to its effective temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴). The maximum flux occurs when we see the unspotted hemisphere, which has a uniform temperature `T_eff`.\n    `F_max` ∝ `T_eff`⁴\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimum Flux (F_min):**\n    The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view. This hemisphere's surface is a composite of the normal photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   The fraction of the area covered by spots is the filling factor, `f = 0.20`.\n    *   The temperature of these spots is `T_spot = T_eff - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The remaining fraction of the area, `1 - f = 0.80`, is at the star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n    The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the spotted and unspotted parts.\n    `F_min` ∝ (1 - `f`) * `T_eff`⁴ + `f` * `T_spot`⁴\n\n4.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot-Induced Variation:**\n    The amplitude of the light curve signal is the relative change in flux:\n    Amplitude_spots = (`F_max` - `F_min`) / `F_max`\n    Amplitude_spots = (`T_eff`⁴ - [(1 - `f`) * `T_eff`⁴ + `f` * `T_spot`⁴]) / `T_eff`⁴\n    Simplifying this expression:\n    Amplitude_spots = (`T_eff`⁴ - `T_eff`⁴ + `f` * `T_eff`⁴ - `f` * `T_spot`⁴) / `T_eff`⁴\n    Amplitude_spots = (`f` * `T_eff`⁴ - `f` * `T_spot`⁴) / `T_eff`⁴\n    Amplitude_spots = `f` * (1 - (`T_spot` / `T_eff`)⁴)\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    The problem asks for the size of a hypothetical planet that would cause the same amplitude signal if it transited an unspotted star. The dimming caused by a planet transit is equal to the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * `R_pl`²) / (π * `R_star`²)\n    Amplitude_planet = (`R_pl` / `R_star`)²\n\n6.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve:**\n    To find the relative radius of the planet (`R_pl` / `R_star`), we set the two amplitudes equal to each other.\n    (`R_pl` / `R_star`)² = Amplitude_spots\n    (`R_pl` / `R_star`)² = `f` * (1 - (`T_spot` / `T_eff`)⁴)\n    `R_pl` / `R_star` = sqrt(`f` * (1 - (`T_spot` / `T_eff`)⁴))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and compute the result.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the light curve variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\namplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of a transit is (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# We set the amplitudes to be equal: (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_spots\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spots)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem requires us to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by a star's spotted hemisphere and then find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause an identical signal during a transit.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Spots**\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible surface is at the effective temperature, `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This surface is a mix of normal photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   Area of spots = `f` = 20% = 0.20\n    *   Area of normal photosphere = `1 - f` = 80% = 0.80\n    *   Temperature of spots, `T_spot = T_eff - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n    The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average:\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the relative change in flux:\n`Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux (and canceling the proportionality constant):\n`Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - [ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴ ]) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spots = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spots = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size**\n\nThe dimming of a star's light during a transit (the amplitude of the transit signal) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n`Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star`\n`Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n`Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**Part 3: Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nWe want the planet to produce the same amplitude signal as the spots.\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nNow, solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThe python code confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of `0.32179...`.\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>"
