    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Define the Species and Equilibria:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) exists in equilibrium with several thiocyanato complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-\n\n3.  **Use the Overall Stability Constants (β):**\n    The formation of each complex is described by an overall stability constant (β_n):\n    *   Co^2+ + SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)]⁺ : β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n    *   Co^2+ + 2SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)₂] : β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n    *   Co^2+ + 3SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ : β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n    *   Co^2+ + 4SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ : β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n4.  **Define the Fraction of Each Species (α):**\n    The fraction (α_n) of each species [Co(SCN)_n] is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration c(Co). We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of [Co^2+], [SCN⁻], and its stability constant:\n    *   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n    The total cobalt concentration can be written as:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is:\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n5.  **Assumption on Ligand Concentration:**\n    The problem states [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, which is significantly smaller. In such cases, it is a common and reasonable assumption to treat the given ligand concentration as the free (equilibrium) ligand concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The information about the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species under this assumption.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Percentage:**\n    Now, substitute the given values into the formula for α₂:\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\n    Let's calculate each term in the expression:\n    *   Numerator term: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Denominator terms:\n        *   1 (for free Co²⁺)\n        *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of denominator terms (let's call it `S`): S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    Now, calculate α₂:\n    α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    To get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches one of the provided options. The following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Thiocyanate concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms for the denominator sum (the polynomial P)\n# P = 1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]**2 + beta3*[SCN-]**3 + beta4*[SCN-]**4\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# Denominator sum\ndenominator_sum = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)2], which is term2\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant species and equilibria:**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and its complexes with thiocyanate (SCN⁻):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n**2. Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nGiven values are:\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\nSince the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is much smaller than the ligand concentration (0.1 M), we can assume that the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, [SCN⁻], is approximately equal to its initial concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n**3. Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex (α₂):**\n\nThe fraction of any species is its concentration divided by the total concentration. For [Co(SCN)₂]:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from step 2 into the total concentration equation:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, express α₂ by substituting the expressions for [Co(SCN)₂] and c(Co):\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Substitute the numerical values and compute:**\n\n*   Numerator: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator:\n    *   1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n*   Sum of denominator terms = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches the calculation from the Python code output (16.916...).\n\n<<<A>>>"
