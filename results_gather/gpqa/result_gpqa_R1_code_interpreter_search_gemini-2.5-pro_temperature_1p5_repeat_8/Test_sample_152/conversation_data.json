These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is the one attached to the p-tolyl group.\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base used to deprotonate the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base, EtO⁻, removes an acidic α-proton from dimethyl malonate. The α-protons are acidic because the resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with both adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + EtO⁻ ⇌ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + EtOH\n\n3.  **Michael Addition (1,4-Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor.\n    *   The nucleophile, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, attacks the β-carbon of p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=C π-bond, pushing the electrons to form a new enolate intermediate: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃.\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final neutral product (A).\n    *   p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n5.  **Identify and Name Product (A):**\n    *   The structure is (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   To name this molecule using the options provided, we can identify the parent acid as propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid with a p-tolyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   Parent acid: (HOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOH\n    *   Esterification with three molecules of methanol gives the trimethyl ester.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\nThis is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael-type addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the carbon that was α to the carbonyl in the parent ketone, which is cyclohexanone).\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   Attack occurs at the β-carbon of CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n    *   The enamine functionality is converted back to a ketone (C=O) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n4.  **Identify and Name Product (B):**\n    *   The final product has a cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   A new substituent is attached at the C2 position (α to the carbonyl).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the Michael acceptor: -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   So, the final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN group at C2.\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N. The substituent, a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group, is on the C3 position.\n    *   The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is generally the major tautomer compared to the enol form for simple β-ketonitriles.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis requires working backward from the product to find the starting material (C). This is a retrosynthetic analysis of a Michael reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reagents:**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This consists of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione core and a (3-oxobutyl) side chain (-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃) attached at C2.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), which has the structure CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:** The bond formed in a Michael addition is between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is a highly acidic α-carbon (between two carbonyls). This is the α-carbon of the donor.\n    *   The β-carbon of the acceptor (but-3-en-2-one) is the terminal CH₂ group.\n    *   The side chain in the product is -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃, which matches the structure of MVK after addition at the β-carbon and subsequent protonation.\n    *   Therefore, the bond formed is between C2 of the donor ring and the terminal carbon of MVK.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant (C):** By breaking this newly formed bond, we can identify the original Michael donor. If we remove the (3-oxobutyl) group from C2 of the product, we are left with the original Michael donor.\n    *   Removing -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃ from 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione leaves **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The reaction is: the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (formed with KOH) attacks but-3-en-2-one. This is the first step of the Robinson annulation sequence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect name for A and B.\n*   B) Incorrect name for A, B, and C.\n*   C) Matches all three identified structures/names.\n*   D) Incorrect name for C.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
