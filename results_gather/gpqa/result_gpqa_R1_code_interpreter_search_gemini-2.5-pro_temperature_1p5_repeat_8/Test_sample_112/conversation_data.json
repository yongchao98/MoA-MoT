    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). It can also indicate an alcohol (-OH), but the broadness is usually more pronounced for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak and a C=O peak strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C peak indicates the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to the carbons of a double bond (H-C=C). This piece of data explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to determine the possible atomic composition of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. We will use the integer masses of the most common isotopes (C=12, H=1, O=16).\n    *   Let's test some combinations:\n        *   C₃H₉⁺: (3 * 12) + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45. This is the propyl cation.\n        *   C₂H₅O⁺: (2 * 12) + 5 + 16 = 24 + 5 + 16 = 45. This is an ethoxy or hydroxyethyl fragment.\n        *   COOH⁺: 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45. This corresponds to the carboxyl group fragment.\n    *   Given the strong evidence for a carboxylic acid from the FTIR data, the fragment at m/z = 45 is almost certainly the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides powerful confirmation of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize All Information:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have identified a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**. This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   From FTIR and 1H NMR, we have identified a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (or Double Bond Equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is `DBE = C - H/2 + 1` (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our molecule contains one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond.\n    *   Total DBE required = 1 (for C=O) + 1 (for C=C) = **2**.\n    *   The molecule must also contain **2 oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DBE for each option and check the oxygen count:\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 2. (Matches)\n        *   DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. (Matches)\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 2. (Matches)\n        *   DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. (Does not match. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, like hexanoic acid).\n    *   **C) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 1. (Does not match).\n        *   DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. (Does not match).\n    *   **D) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygen count = 1. (Does not match).\n        *   DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. (DBE matches, but oxygen count is wrong. This would be something like an unsaturated ketone or aldehyde).\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Only the formula **C6H10O2** is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms (2) to be a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl C=O bond and a C=C double bond. A possible structure for this compound is hexenoic acid (e.g., *trans*-2-hexenoic acid).\n\n<<<A>>>"
