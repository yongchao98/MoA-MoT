    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\nThe particle is spin 1/2 and is initially in a magnetic field `B_initial` pointing in the `+z` direction. Its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with this field. The magnetic moment operator is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin vector operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is `H = -μ · B`.\n\nInitially, `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS_z B`.\nThe energy levels are `E = -γB m_s ħ`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` (for spin-up, `|+z⟩`) or `-1/2` (for spin-down, `|-z⟩`).\n\nThe term \"aligned with the magnetic field\" means the magnetic moment vector points in the same direction as the magnetic field. This is the lower energy state.\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`. For the expectation value to be in the `+z` direction, `<μ_z>` must be positive.\n*   If `γ > 0` (e.g., for a proton), `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>` is positive when `<S_z>` is positive. The state with the maximum positive `<S_z>` is `|+z⟩` (where `<S_z> = +ħ/2`). This state has energy `E = -γB(ħ/2)`, which is the lower energy state.\n*   If `γ < 0` (e.g., for an electron), `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>` is positive when `<S_z>` is negative. The state with the most negative `<S_z>` is `|-z⟩` (where `<S_z> = -ħ/2`). This state has energy `E = -γB(-ħ/2) = |γ|B(ħ/2)`. Wait, let me recheck the energy. `E = -γ<S_z>B`. For the state `|-z>`, `E = -γ(-ħ/2)B = γħB/2`. Since `γ` is negative, this energy is negative, making it the lower energy state.\n\nSo, in either case, the system starts in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian. Let's proceed assuming `γ > 0` and the initial state is `|+z⟩`. We will see that the final frequency doesn't depend on this choice.\nThe initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. In matrix form, `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to be `B_new` in the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\nThe new Hamiltonian for `t>0` is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS_y B`.\nThe spin operator `S_y` is `(ħ/2)σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\nSo, `H = -γB(ħ/2)σ_y`.\nLet's define the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\nThe Hamiltonian becomes `H = -(ħω_L/2)σ_y`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\nThe state evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩`.\nSubstituting `H`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i[-(ħω_L/2)σ_y]t/ħ) |+z⟩`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(i(ω_L t/2)σ_y) |+z⟩`\n\nTo evaluate the matrix exponential `exp(iθσ_y)`, we use the general formula `exp(iθ n · σ) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ) n · σ`, where `n` is a unit vector. Here `θ = ω_L t/2` and `n` is the y-direction vector `(0,1,0)`.\n`exp(i(ω_L t/2)σ_y) = cos(ω_L t/2)I + i sin(ω_L t/2)σ_y`\nwhere `I` is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\nNow, we apply this operator to the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(ω_L t/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(ω_L t/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]] [[1], [0]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] + i sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [i]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] + i² sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [1]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2) [[1], [0]] - sin(ω_L t/2) [[0], [1]]`\nIn ket notation, this is:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`.\nWe know `μ_z = γS_z`. So we need to calculate `<S_z>(t)`.\n`<S_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`\nThe operator `S_z` is `(ħ/2)σ_z`, where `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = S_z (cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩)`\nSince `S_z|+z⟩ = +(ħ/2)|+z⟩` and `S_z|-z⟩ = -(ħ/2)|-z⟩`:\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω_L t/2)(ħ/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ω_L t/2)(-ħ/2)|-z⟩`\n`S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ + sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩]`\n\nNow we compute the inner product `⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`:\n`⟨ψ(t)| = cos(ω_L t/2)⟨+z| - sin(ω_L t/2)⟨-z|`\n`<S_z>(t) = (cos(ω_L t/2)⟨+z| - sin(ω_L t/2)⟨-z|) * (ħ/2) [cos(ω_L t/2)|+z⟩ + sin(ω_L t/2)|-z⟩]`\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis kets (`⟨+z|+z⟩=1`, `⟨-z|-z⟩=1`, `⟨+z|-z⟩=0`):\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) [cos²(ω_L t/2) * 1 - sin²(ω_L t/2) * 1]`\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) [cos²(ω_L t/2) - sin²(ω_L t/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) cos(ω_L t)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ω_L t)`\nSubstituting `ω_L = γB`:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThis is an oscillatory function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n`ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the new magnetic field (`y`-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω_L = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the `z`-axis oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
