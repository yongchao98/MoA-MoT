    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid solution (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n    *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M₂ * (40.00 cm³)\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.**\n*   First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.\n    *   Volume in Liters = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   Moles of acid (CH₃COOH) = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   This creates a buffer solution, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    *   pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH])\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is the ratio of their moles, which corresponds to the percentage of titration: 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution:\n    *   V_total = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   V_total = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]):\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   Calculate pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nComparing our calculated values (pH at 25% = 4.26; pH at equivalence = 8.52) with the options:\nA) 4.26; 8.52\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
