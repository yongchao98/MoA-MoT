    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula is DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (like in a carbonyl group, C=O).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with the aldehyde proton of the -CH2-CHO fragment. The chemical shift of 3.66 ppm is typical for benzylic protons that are also alpha to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts suggest at least one electron-donating group is attached to the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is indicative of an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2. Given the molecular formula contains nitrogen, this is the primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n    *   The starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**, also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    Structure of Starting Material:\n    ```\n        H2N - (C6H4) - CH2CHO  (para-isomer)\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This set of reagents is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   Intermediate A: 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride\n    ```\n        [Cl-][N2+] - (C6H4) - CH2CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt, often with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols from anilines.\n    *   Intermediate B: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)\n    ```\n        HO - (C6H4) - CH2CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating intermediate B with a strong base (KOH) and heat. Intermediate B is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). These conditions are perfect for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde present, it will be a self-condensation.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Subsequent protonation yields the aldol addition product.\n        *   Addition Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (B).\n        ```\n                  OH\n                  |\n        HO-(C6H4)-CH2-CH - CH(CHO)-(C6H4)-OH\n        ```\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. The proton on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl (C2) is removed, and the -OH group on the beta carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   Final Product: The dehydration of the aldol adduct leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n        ```\n                             CHO\n                             |\n        HO-(C6H4)-CH2 - CH = C -(C6H4)-OH\n        ```\n        Let's confirm the name: The main chain is a but-2-enal. A 4-hydroxyphenyl group is at position 2, and another 4-hydroxyphenyl group is attached to the carbon at position 4. The name is indeed 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\nThe sequence of reactions transforms p-aminophenylacetaldehyde into p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation under basic, heated conditions. The final stable product of this aldol condensation is the dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
