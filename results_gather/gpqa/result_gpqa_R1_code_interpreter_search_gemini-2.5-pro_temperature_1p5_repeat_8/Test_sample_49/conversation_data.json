    "This problem requires us to deduce the number of loops in a Feynman diagram from a mathematical expression that represents a \"size estimate\" of the corresponding physical quantity (like a cross-section or decay rate).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the key components of the expression:**\n    The given expression is: `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n    This expression contains several types of terms:\n    *   **Coupling constants:** `alpha^3` and `g^2`. `alpha` is the fine-structure constant, and `g` is another coupling constant. These tell us about the vertices in the diagram.\n    *   **Numerical factors:** `sqrt(2)` and `8`. These are typically results of specific integrations or group theory factors.\n    *   **Kinematic factors:** `(Q/M)^2`. This is a ratio of energy scales squared, typical in calculations involving masses and momentum transfer.\n    *   **Loop suppression factor:** `1/(4pi)^6`. This is the most crucial term for determining the number of loops.\n\n2.  **Analyze the loop suppression factor:**\n    In Quantum Field Theory (QFT) calculations in four-dimensional spacetime, each closed loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral over an undetermined four-momentum, `k`. The standard integration measure for each loop is `∫ d⁴k / (2π)⁴`.\n\n    When these integrals are evaluated (often using techniques like Wick rotation and dimensional regularization), they consistently produce a characteristic suppression factor. For each loop, this factor is `1/(16π²)`, which can be rewritten as `1/(4π)²`.\n\n    This factor appears in the amplitude `M` of the process. So, for a diagram with `L` loops, the amplitude `M` will be proportional to `(1/(4π)²)^L`.\n    \n    `M ∝ (1/(4π)²)^L`\n\n3.  **Relate the amplitude to the observable:**\n    The \"size estimate\" on the note is for a physical observable quantity, such as a decay rate (`Γ`) or a scattering cross-section (`σ`). These observables are proportional to the squared magnitude of the amplitude, `|M|²`.\n\n    Therefore, the observable quantity will have a dependence on the loop factor as follows:\n    \n    `Observable ∝ |M|² ∝ |(1/(4π)²)^L|² = (1/(4π)²)^(2L) = 1/(4π)^(4L)`\n\n    Wait, let's reconsider. The `1/(4π)^2` factor is often quoted as the suppression for the entire loop contribution to a rate or cross-section, not just the amplitude. This is a common convention in \"Naive Dimensional Analysis\" (NDA) used for size estimates. In this framework, the loop expansion is an expansion in powers of `(coupling / 4π)`. The core idea is that each loop adds a factor of `1/(16π²) = 1/(4π)²` to the overall expression for the rate or cross-section.\n\n    Let's adopt this standard rule of thumb for \"size estimates\":\n    An observable quantity calculated from an `L`-loop diagram is suppressed by a factor of `(1/(4π)²)^L`.\n\n    `Observable ∝ (1/(4π)²)^L = (4π)^(-2L)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the number of loops (L):**\n    The expression on the note contains the factor `1/(4pi)^6`, which can be written as `(4π)^(-6)`.\n    We can now equate this with the general loop suppression factor:\n\n    `(4π)^(-2L) = (4π)^(-6)`\n\n    By comparing the exponents, we get:\n\n    `-2L = -6`\n\n    `L = 3`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The other factors in the expression, such as the powers of the coupling constants `alpha` and `g`, relate to the number of vertices in the diagram. While a more complex analysis could try to relate the number of vertices to the number of loops, the most direct and reliable piece of information for determining the loop number is the characteristic `(4π)` suppression factor. The power of this factor points directly to a 3-loop diagram.\n\nThe diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
