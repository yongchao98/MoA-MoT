    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the System and Coordinates**\n\n*   We have an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons.\n*   Let's set up a 1D coordinate system along the horizontal axis (x-axis).\n*   The electron moves from left to right, so its velocity is in the +x direction.\n*   The positron moves from right to left, so its velocity is in the -x direction.\n\n**2. State the Conservation Laws**\n\nThe fundamental principles we need to apply are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of momentum.\n*   Total Energy (Initial) = Total Energy (Final)\n*   Total Momentum (Initial) = Total Momentum (Final)\n\n**3. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nLet `m` be the rest mass of the electron (which is the same as the positron's rest mass) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **For the electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Energy, `E_e = γ_e * m * c^2 = 4mc^2`.\n    *   Momentum magnitude is given by `p = m*c*sqrt(γ^2 - 1)`.\n    *   Momentum, `p_e = m * c * sqrt(4^2 - 1) = m * c * sqrt(15)`. Since it moves in the +x direction, the momentum vector is `(mc*sqrt(15), 0)`.\n\n*   **For the positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Energy, `E_p = γ_p * m * c^2 = 2mc^2`.\n    *   Momentum, `p_p = m * c * sqrt(2^2 - 1) = m * c * sqrt(3)`. Since it moves in the -x direction, the momentum vector is `(-mc*sqrt(3), 0)`.\n\n*   **Total Initial State:**\n    *   Total Energy `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc^2 + 2mc^2 = 6mc^2`.\n    *   Total Momentum `p_initial_x = p_e + p_p = mc*sqrt(15) - mc*sqrt(3) = mc * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))`.\n    *   Total initial momentum in the y-direction is `p_initial_y = 0`.\n\n**4. Describe the Final State (Two Photons)**\n\n*   The problem states the two photons have the same energy. Let's call this energy `E_γ`.\n*   For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = p*c`, so they also have the same momentum magnitude, `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n*   The photons move \"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\". Due to the conservation of momentum in the y-direction (which starts at 0), their y-momentum components must be equal and opposite. This means they are emitted at symmetric angles `θ` and `-θ` relative to the x-axis.\n\n*   **Photon 1 (upper-right):**\n    *   Momentum components: `(p_γ * cos(θ), p_γ * sin(θ))`.\n\n*   **Photon 2 (lower-right):**\n    *   Momentum components: `(p_γ * cos(θ), -p_γ * sin(θ))`.\n\n*   **Total Final State:**\n    *   Total Energy `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    *   Total Momentum `p_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Total Momentum `p_final_y = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0`.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation Laws to Solve for the Angle**\n\n*   **From Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `6mc^2 = 2E_γ`\n    *   `E_γ = 3mc^2`. This is the energy of each photon.\n    *   We can now find the momentum of each photon: `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3mc`.\n\n*   **From Conservation of Momentum (x-direction):**\n    *   `p_initial_x = p_final_x`\n    *   `mc * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Substitute the value of `p_γ` we just found:\n    *   `mc * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ)`.\n    *   `mc * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6mc * cos(θ)`.\n\n*   **Solve for θ:**\n    *   We can cancel `mc` from both sides:\n    *   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n    *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`.\n\n*   **Find the Angle Between the Photons:**\n    *   The angle of the first photon is `θ` and the second is `-θ`. The total angle between their directions is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\n    *   We need to calculate `2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n\nLet's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n\n# The angle between the photons is 2 * theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n```output\n138.2562424843469\n```\nThe result is approximately 138 degrees.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 74\nB) 172\nC) 138\nD) 96\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
