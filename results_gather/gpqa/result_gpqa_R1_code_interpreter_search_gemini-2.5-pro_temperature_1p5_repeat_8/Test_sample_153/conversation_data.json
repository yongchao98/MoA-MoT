    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires interpreting several types of spectroscopic data. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   So, we are looking for a compound containing one chlorine atom with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl). Let's check the options, which all have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options are isomers and match the mass spectrometry data. We need to use the other spectra to differentiate them.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an acyl chloride and would lack the broad O-H) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde and a phenol; while it has an O-H, it wouldn't be as broad as a carboxylic acid, and the carbonyl would be for an aldehyde). We are now left with options B and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7-8.5 ppm):** We have two signals in this region, which indicates the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **The Aromatic Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, symmetry causes the two protons ortho to one substituent to be chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent to also be equivalent. This results in two sets of protons. Each set splits the other into a doublet.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n*   We have narrowed our choices down to 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho-substituted):** Would have 4 distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex pattern of multiplets, not two simple doublets.\n*   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (para-substituted):** This structure has the required 1,4-disubstitution pattern that gives rise to two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, combining all the evidence, the unknown compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
