Deconstruction of the Problem**\n*   **Objective**: Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n*   **Key Information**:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so the star's properties (Temperature T_star, Radius R_star, Mass M_star) are constant for both.\n    *   Both planets have the same albedo (A).\n    *   Planet 1 Mass (M_p1) = 7 M_Earth\n    *   Planet 2 Mass (M_p2) = 5 M_Earth\n    *   Planet 1 max Doppler shift (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Planet 2 max Doppler shift (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n    *   Detection via transit method implies orbital inclination i ≈ 90° for both.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\nWe want the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2*a₁)) ] / [ T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2*a₂)) ]\n\nSince T_star, A, and R_star are the same for both planets, they cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit (and M_p << M_star) is:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) * √(G / (M_star * a))\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits are edge-on, so sin(i) ≈ 1 for both. We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nNow we form the ratio a₂ / a₁. The constants G and M_star cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the Ratio of Axes into the Temperature Ratio Formula**\nFrom Step 1, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁).\nSubstituting the result from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[ (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)² ]\n\nThe square and the square root cancel each other, leaving:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\n*   The ratio of planet masses (M_p₂ / M_p₁) is 5 / 7.\n*   The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (since K/c = Δλ/λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of velocities (K₁ / K₂) is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂).\n*   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4.\n\nNow substitute these values into the final equation from Step 4:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n**Step 6: Convert to a Decimal and Match the Answer**\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires finding the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets orbiting the same star.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are the same for both and cancel out in the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**2. Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced by a planet on its star is given by:\n$K \\approx M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n(assuming a circular orbit and the planet's mass $M_p$ is much less than the star's mass $M_{star}$).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx M_p^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n\nThe constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Relating Radial Velocity (K) to Doppler Shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$)**\n\nThe observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ is directly proportional to the radial velocity $K$. Therefore, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root cancels out the squares:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step derivation of the solution confirms the correct approach and result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulating the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature, `T_eq`, is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`.\n    When taking the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, several terms cancel out because the planets orbit the same star (`T_star`, `R_star`) and have the same albedo (`A`). This leaves a simplified relationship:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)` or `sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`.\n    This step is correctly identified by nearly all agents that provided reasoning (e.g., Agents 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13).\n\n2.  **Relating Orbital Distance (a) to Radial Velocity (K)**: The semi-major axis (`a`) needs to be determined from the given radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is `K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`. (The `sin(i)` term is ~1 because the planets are transiting).\n    Rearranging for `a` gives `a ≈ G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)`.\n\n3.  **Determining the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1)**: By taking the ratio of `a` for the two planets, the constant terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leading to:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²`\n    This crucial derivation is also performed correctly by the majority of reasoning agents.\n\n4.  **Connecting Doppler Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity (K)**: The Doppler shift is directly proportional to the radial velocity (`Δλ / λ_0 = K / c`). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts: `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Combining the steps gives the final equation for the temperature ratio:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)² ) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)`\n    Substituting the given values:\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n    *   `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n6.  **Numerical Result**: `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Answers\n\n*   A strong consensus exists on the calculation and the final numerical value of **~0.536**. Agents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 all correctly derive or state this value.\n*   However, there is significant disagreement on which letter option this corresponds to. This suggests that the agents may have been working from different or scrambled lists of options.\n*   Referring to the option list provided in the question:\n    A) ~ 1.05\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 0.98\n    D) ~ 1.30\n*   The calculated value `0.5357` is unambiguously closest to option B (`~ 0.53`). Agents 2 and 14 correctly identify this. The other agents who performed the calculation correctly failed to map their result to the correct letter from the provided list.\n\nThe overwhelming mathematical consensus points to a value of approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulating and Simplifying the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    According to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants that cancel out) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). The constants also cancel. The formula simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:** The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, $K$, induced on a star by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits are edge-on to us, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    First, we rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n    Now we can form the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constant terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ will cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p,1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Connecting Doppler Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude:** The observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v$) via the relation $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v}{c}$. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum RVs (the semi-amplitudes $K_1$ and $K_2$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substituting the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio gives:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n    Now substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n    Plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p,1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p,2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this with the provided options:\n    A) ~ 0.98\n    B) ~ 1.05\n    C) ~ 1.30\n    D) ~ 0.53\n    The calculated value is closest to 0.53, which is option D. Most of the candidate agents correctly perform the calculation but make an error in selecting the final letter.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's break down the solution into clear, logical steps.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n\nThe formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\sqrt{R_{star} / (2 a_1)}}{T_{star} (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\sqrt{R_{star} / (2 a_2)}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It is also given that the planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). These terms, along with the constant 2, cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 / a_1}}{\\sqrt{1 / a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo solve the problem, we now need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a₂ / a₁`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K), which represents the maximum speed of the star's \"wobble\" induced by an orbiting planet, is given by the formula (for a circular orbit and a planet mass much smaller than the star's):\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\nwhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be seen nearly edge-on. This means the inclination `i` for both planets is approximately 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n$K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n$a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂/a₁)\n\nNow, we can form the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` are constants and cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 4: Substitute and Calculate the Final Value\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift (Δλ), so the ratio K₁/K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂.\n\nNow we can substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nFinally, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1): $5 M_{Earth} / 7 M_{Earth} = 5/7$\n*   Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂) which equals K₁ / K₂: $0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

This can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form and Simplify the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    Based on the problem statement, several terms are identical for both planets and can be canceled out:\n    *   They orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants.\n    *   They have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$.\n    *   The factor of 2 is also a constant.\n\n    This simplification leaves us with:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity:** To find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$). This can be found using the data from the radial velocity (RV) method.

Relate Orbital Distance (`a`) to Radial Velocity (`K`)**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is:\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n(This assumes `M_p << M_star` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`, both of which are valid here).\n\nWe need to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n**4. Formulate the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\n\nNow we form the ratio `a2 / a1`. The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n**5. Connect `K` to Doppler Shift (`Δλ`)**\n\nThe observed Doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity (`K ∝ Δλ`). Therefore, the ratio of velocities is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts:\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\n**6. Substitute and Calculate**\n\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the `a2 / a1` equation:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`\n\nNow substitute this result into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt[ (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 ]`\n\nThe square and the square root cancel each other, leaving a very simple final relationship:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\nPlug in the given values:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n**7. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **~ 0.53**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Task**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. The Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhen we form a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) and having the same albedo ($A$), the common terms cancel out, leaving a simplified relationship:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\nThis crucial simplification is correctly identified by most agents (e.g., Agents 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13). This means the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n**3. The Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\nTo find the temperature ratio, we must first find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$. This can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data.\nFor a circular orbit (as stated) and a system viewed nearly edge-on (implied by the transit detection), the stellar RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow, forming the ratio $a_2 / a_1$, the constant terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\nThis derivation is also correctly performed by the most thorough agents.\n\n**4. Substituting Back and Final Calculation**\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$). So we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, calculate the final temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**5.

Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated result, ~0.536, is closest to 0.53. Several agents (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 13) correctly performed this calculation and identified the right answer. Other agents either made a mistake in their final step or mis-matched their correct numerical answer to the wrong letter option. The clear consensus on the calculation method and result confirms the answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Goal Identification**\nThe primary task is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2. This can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulating the Temperature Ratio**\nWe can set up a ratio of the temperatures for the two planets:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n**4. Simplifying the Ratio**\nBased on the information given in the problem:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants that cancel out.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ term cancels out.\n*   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n\nThis leaves a simplified expression that depends only on the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n**5. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe next step is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$) using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}}$ (after simplifying and collecting constants)\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\nSince the planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits are edge-on, meaning $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{a} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**6. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can create the ratio for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**7. Plugging in the Given Values**\nNow we substitute the numerical values from the problem statement:\n*   Mass Ratio: $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler Shift Ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**8. Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, we substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.5357.

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures `T_eq1 / T_eq2` is `((1/a1) / (1/a2))^(1/2)` which simplifies to `(a2 / a1)^(1/2)`.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: The semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass `M_p` and the radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` it induces on the star. The relationship is `a` is proportional to `M_p^2 / K^2`. Thus, the ratio `a2 / a1` is `(M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift**: The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift `Δλ`. So, `K1 / K2` equals `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Combining these relationships, we get:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    `M_p1 = 7 M_Earth`\n    `M_p2 = 5 M_Earth`\n    `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å`\n    `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n5.  **Result**: `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`. The code output confirms this calculation.

We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nNow we form the ratio a₂ / a₁.

Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1 - A)$ are the same for both and cancel out in the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**2. Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced by a planet on its star is given by:\n$K \\approx M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n(assuming a circular orbit and the planet's mass $M_p$ is much less than the star's mass $M_{star}$).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx M_p^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n\nThe constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Relating Radial Velocity (K) to Doppler Shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$)**\n\nThe observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ is directly proportional to the radial velocity $K$. Therefore, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nThe square root cancels out the squares:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step derivation of the solution confirms the correct approach and result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulating the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature, `T_eq`, is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`.\n    When taking the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, several terms cancel out because the planets orbit the same star (`T_star`, `R_star`) and have the same albedo (`A`). This leaves a simplified relationship:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)` or `sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`.\n    This step is correctly identified by nearly all agents that provided reasoning (e.g., Agents 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13).\n\n2.  **Relating Orbital Distance (a) to Radial Velocity (K)**: The semi-major axis (`a`) needs to be determined from the given radial velocity (RV) data. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (`K`) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is `K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`. (The `sin(i)` term is ~1 because the planets are transiting).\n    Rearranging for `a` gives `a ≈ G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)`.\n\n3.  **Determining the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1)**: By taking the ratio of `a` for the two planets, the constant terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leading to:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²`\n    This crucial derivation is also performed correctly by the majority of reasoning agents.\n\n4.  **Connecting Doppler Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity (K)**: The Doppler shift is directly proportional to the radial velocity (`Δλ / λ_0 = K / c`). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts: `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Combining the steps gives the final equation for the temperature ratio:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)² ) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K_1 / K_2)`\n    Substituting the given values:\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n    *   `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n6.  **Numerical Result**: `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Answers\n\n*   A strong consensus exists on the calculation and the final numerical value of **~0.536**. Agents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 all correctly derive or state this value.\n*   However, there is significant disagreement on which letter option this corresponds to. This suggests that the agents may have been working from different or scrambled lists of options.\n*   Referring to the option list provided in the question:\n    A) ~ 1.05\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 0.98\n    D) ~ 1.30\n*   The calculated value `0.5357` is unambiguously closest to option B (`~ 0.53`). Agents 2 and 14 correctly identify this. The other agents who performed the calculation correctly failed to map their result to the correct letter from the provided list.\n\nThe overwhelming mathematical consensus points to a value of approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulating and Simplifying the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    According to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants that cancel out) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). The constants also cancel. The formula simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( 1/a_1 \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( 1/a_2 \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:** The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, $K$, induced on a star by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits are edge-on to us, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    First, we rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n    Now we can form the ratio $a_2/a_1$. The constant terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ will cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p,1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Connecting Doppler Shift to RV Semi-Amplitude:** The observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v$) via the relation $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v}{c}$. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum RVs (the semi-amplitudes $K_1$ and $K_2$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substituting the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio gives:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n    Now substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n    Plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p,1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    *   $M_{p,2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

Based on the correct physics and arithmetic, the answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis task requires finding the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n\nThe formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the temperatures for Planet 1 and Planet 2, we set up the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nAccording to the problem, both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet on its star is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince both planets were found via the transit method, their orbits are edge-on to us, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Rearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n$a \\approx \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$. The constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ will cancel:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p,2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p,1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}\\right)} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{M_{p,1}^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### Step 3: Combine Formulas and Substitute Values\n\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$).

Formulate the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere `a` is the orbital semi-major axis.\n\nThe ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` simplifies significantly because `T_star`, `R_star`, and `A` are the same for both planets:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a1) / sqrt(1/a2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nThe problem now boils down to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance (`a`) to Radial Velocity (`K`)**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is:\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n(This assumes `M_p << M_star` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`, both of which are valid here).\n\nWe need to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n**4. Formulate the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\n\nNow we form the ratio `a2 / a1`. The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n**5. Connect `K` to Doppler Shift (`Δλ`)**\n\nThe observed Doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity (`K ∝ Δλ`). Therefore, the ratio of velocities is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts:\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\n**6. Substitute and Calculate**\n\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the `a2 / a1` equation:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`\n\nNow substitute this result into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt[ (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 ]`\n\nThe square and the square root cancel each other, leaving a very simple final relationship:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\nPlug in the given values:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n**7.

This means the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n**3. The Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\nTo find the temperature ratio, we must first find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$. This can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data.\nFor a circular orbit (as stated) and a system viewed nearly edge-on (implied by the transit detection), the stellar RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow, forming the ratio $a_2 / a_1$, the constant terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\nThis derivation is also correctly performed by the most thorough agents.\n\n**4. Substituting Back and Final Calculation**\nNow, substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_1}{K_2}$\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$). So we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, calculate the final temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**5.

Several agents (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 13) correctly performed this calculation and identified the right answer. Other agents either made a mistake in their final step or mis-matched their correct numerical answer to the wrong letter option. The clear consensus on the calculation method and result confirms the answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Goal Identification**\nThe primary task is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2. This can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulating the Temperature Ratio**\nWe can set up a ratio of the temperatures for the two planets:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n**4. Simplifying the Ratio**\nBased on the information given in the problem:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants that cancel out.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ term cancels out.\n*   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n\nThis leaves a simplified expression that depends only on the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n**5. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe next step is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$) using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}}$ (after simplifying and collecting constants)\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\nSince the planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits are edge-on, meaning $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{a} \\implies a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}$\n\n**6. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can create the ratio for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**7. Plugging in the Given Values**\nNow we substitute the numerical values from the problem statement:\n*   Mass Ratio: $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   Doppler Shift Ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**8. Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, we substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **A) ~ 0.53**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis of the problem proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` of a planet is proportional to `(1/a)^(1/4)`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit, assuming the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures `T_eq1 / T_eq2` is `((1/a1) / (1/a2))^(1/2)` which simplifies to `(a2 / a1)^(1/2)`.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: The semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass `M_p` and the radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` it induces on the star. The relationship is `a` is proportional to `M_p^2 / K^2`. Thus, the ratio `a2 / a1` is `(M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift**: The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift `Δλ`. So, `K1 / K2` equals `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Combining these relationships, we get:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    `M_p1 = 7 M_Earth`\n    `M_p2 = 5 M_Earth`\n    `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å`\n    `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n5.  **Result**: `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`. The code output confirms this calculation. This value is closest to `0.53`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
