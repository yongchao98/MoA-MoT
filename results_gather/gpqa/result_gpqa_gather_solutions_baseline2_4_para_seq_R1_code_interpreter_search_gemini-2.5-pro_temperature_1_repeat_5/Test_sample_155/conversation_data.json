This sequence is a net *anti*-dihydroxylation, adding two -OH groups across the double bond.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry dictates that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single, achiral **meso compound**.

(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   **Key Relationships:** The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds.\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) in an achiral environment.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will *not* be separated and will co-elute, appearing as a **single peak**.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and *will* be separated. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound, and one for the unresolved enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase.

The candidate answers all agree on this chemical reasoning, but their final letter choices differ because they were clearly provided with differently ordered options during their own evaluation. Based on the options presented in the problem description, A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the stereochemical outcome of two distinct reactions, followed by an understanding of how the resulting mixture of compounds behaves during chromatographic separation on both standard (achiral) and chiral columns. The provided candidate answers are unanimous in their chemical reasoning, although they select different final letters, likely due to variations in the presented options. The correct chemical logic is as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** The two-step sequence of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation. Two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond with *anti* stereochemistry (one from the top face, one from the bottom face).\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry dictates that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single, achiral **meso compound**. A meso compound possesses stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation sequence is performed.\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** The complementary stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n*   **Composition:** The final mixture is a combination of the products from both reactions. It contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both of the enantiomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Separations**\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard column and will co-elute, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a **second, distinct peak**.\n    *   **Result:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to distinguish between and separate molecules with different stereochemistries.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the meso compound from the others (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   Critically, it will also resolve the pair of enantiomers—(4R,5R) and (4S,5S)—into two separate peaks because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   **Result:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis definitively shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram**. Matching this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n*   B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\n*   C) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n*   D) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on established chemical principles, synthesized from the unanimous reasoning of the candidate agents.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Reactants and Reaction:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, a symmetrical *trans*-alkene. It undergoes an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction (epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed epoxide opening with water).\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single, achiral **meso compound**. A meso compound contains stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   **Product:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Reactants and Reaction:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a symmetrical *cis*-alkene. It undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene produces a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   **Product:** A 1:1 mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  The achiral meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n        2.  The chiral (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        3.  The chiral (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n4.  **Predict the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Chromatogram**\n    *   **Principle:** Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point) in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are readily separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will elute as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n    *   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows it to distinguish between and separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Analysis:** A chiral column can resolve all stereoisomers. It will resolve the meso-diol (a diastereomer) and, crucially, will also resolve the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) from each other.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical and chromatographic analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.

This sequence results in the *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond, a process known as anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry dictates that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene produces a single, achiral **meso compound**. This is because the product has chiral centers but possesses an internal element of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry), making the molecule achiral as a whole.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction yields a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. All candidate answers are in unanimous agreement on this point.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, undergoes the same anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture**, which is a 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a 1:1 racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

The two-step process involves mCPBA creating an epoxide, which is then opened by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This results in the addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond with *anti*-stereochemistry (one from each side of the original double bond plane).\n*   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry dictates that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single, achiral **meso compound**.

They will not be separated and will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are readily separated into distinct peaks.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and a second for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers because it can differentiate between diastereomers and, crucially, also between the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, a second for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and a third for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe scientific analysis unanimously shows that the combined product mixture will result in **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.

This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, with one adding to the top face and the other to the bottom face.\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry dictates that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene yields a single, achiral **meso compound**. This is because the product has stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal element of symmetry (e.g., a plane or center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Transformation:** The reaction is the same *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture**, which is a 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two compounds is formed: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The final mixture contains the products of both reactions. Therefore, there are three distinct stereoisomers present:\n        1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    *   The relationships between these isomers are key for chromatography:\n        *   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n        *   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols (it is a stereoisomer but not a mirror image of them).\n\n4.  **Predict the Chromatographic Behavior**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties, such as polarity. In an achiral environment, enantiomers have identical physical properties.\n        *   **Result:** Diastereomers (the meso compound vs. the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will separate into different peaks. However, the enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will not separate and will co-elute as a single peak. Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n        *   **Result:** The chiral column will separate all three distinct stereoisomers. It will resolve the meso-diol (as a diastereomer) and, crucially, it will also resolve the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) from each other. Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning from all candidate answers, which is independently verified here, leads to the same conclusion: the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram**.\n\nThis conclusion directly matches option C in the provided question. The variance in the final letter choices among the candidate answers is due to inconsistent lettering of the options they were presented with, not an error in their scientific analysis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive review and synthesis of the provided candidate answers, the final decision can be reached by a logical, step-by-step analysis of the chemistry and chromatography principles. The reasoning presented across all the candidates is virtually unanimous, despite variations in which letter they ultimately selected.\n\n### **Step-by-step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1: Anti-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene**\n    *   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a symmetrical *trans*-alkene) undergoes an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction. This involves the addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond with opposite stereochemistry.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** There is universal agreement among the candidates on the governing stereochemical rule: the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   **Product:** The sole product from Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: Anti-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene**\n    *   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a symmetrical *cis*-alkene) undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** All candidates correctly cite the corresponding rule: the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture**, which is a 1:1 mix of enantiomers.\n    *   **Product:** The product from Reaction 2 is a 1:1 mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   When the products from both reactions are combined, the final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The key relationships, noted by all candidates, are that the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) molecules are **enantiomers** of each other, while the meso molecule is a **diastereomer** of both.\n\n4.  **Predict the Chromatographic Outcomes**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity) in an achiral environment.\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be resolved. They will elute together as a **single peak**.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **will** be resolved. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   **Consensus Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment specifically designed to resolve enantiomers.\n        *   The chiral column can interact differently with all three stereoisomers. It will resolve the diastereomers (meso vs. the pair) and, crucially, will also resolve the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) vs. (4S,5S)) from each other.\n        *   **Consensus Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe unanimous scientific conclusion drawn from the reasoning of all candidate answers is that the combined mixture will show **2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.\n\nComparing this definitive result to the options provided in the question:\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the consensus from the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Anti-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-Alkene**\n    *   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a symmetrical, *trans*-alkene) is treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n    *   **Transformation:** This is an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction, adding two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the double bond.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental and universally agreed-upon rule of stereochemistry dictates that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a single, achiral **meso compound**. A meso compound contains stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   **Product:** The reaction produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Anti-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-Alkene**\n    *   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a symmetrical, *cis*-alkene) undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   **Product:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomeric compounds: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The final mixture, containing the products of both reactions, consists of three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (achiral)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (chiral)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (chiral)\n    *   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both enantiomers.\n\n4.  **Prediction for Chromatographic Separation**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point).\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated and will elute together, appearing as a **single peak**.\n        *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are readily separated. The meso compound will elute at a different time from the enantiomeric pair, appearing as a **separate, second peak**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment that can interact differently with each stereoisomer, including enantiomers.\n        *   The chiral column is specifically designed to resolve enantiomers. The (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-enantiomers will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the others, will also be separated and will have its own unique retention time, appearing as a **third peak**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe consensus of the chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is unambiguous: the final product mixture will produce **2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC** and **3 peaks on the chiral HPLC**.\n\nMatching this outcome to the options provided in the question:\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene.\n    *   **Reaction:** The two-step process of reacting with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) to form an epoxide, followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water (H₃O⁺), results in the net *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups (-OH) across the double bond.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** A fundamental rule of stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene yields a single, achiral **meso compound**. This is because the product has stereocenters but possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces only one product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Reaction:** It undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction as above.\n    *   **Stereochemical Principle:** The corresponding stereochemical rule states that the *anti*-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a 1:1 mixture of two chiral enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   The relationship between these isomers is crucial for chromatography. The (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images). The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of the other two (it is a stereoisomer but not a mirror image).\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point).\n        *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated and will elute from the column together, appearing as a **single peak**.\n        *   **Diastereomers**, on the other hand, have different physical properties. They will be separated by the column.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and a second, distinct peak for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment within the column. This environment allows the column to distinguish between and separate enantiomers.\n        *   The chiral column will separate the meso-diol from the other two isomers (as they are diastereomers).\n        *   Crucially, it will also separate the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers from each other.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will resolve all three unique stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical analysis, which is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all the provided candidate answers, demonstrates that the product mixture will result in **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the given options:\nA) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
