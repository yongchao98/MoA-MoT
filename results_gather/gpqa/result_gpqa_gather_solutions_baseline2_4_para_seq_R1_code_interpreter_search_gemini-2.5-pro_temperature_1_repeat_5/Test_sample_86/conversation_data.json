One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, such as Cl or Br). This group contains 0 carbons.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there are 7 hydrogen atoms to account for in the ¹H NMR spectrum (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Analyze the Options**\n\nWe now need to match the spectrum of a haloacetophenone to the given options. The key is to deduce the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) from the data provided.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from the Spectrum**\nThe NMR data presented in the options is the biggest clue. Option B shows a distinct aromatic pattern: `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two clean doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The molecule's high degree of symmetry results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring, which split each other into two doublets. This allows us to confidently identify the isomer.\n\nWith the structure identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. Chemical shifts will be downfield (high ppm) in the aromatic range (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any protons, so their signal will be a singlet (s) integrating to 3H. Their typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Total Integration:** The total proton count should be 4 (aromatic) + 3 (methyl) = 7H.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nNow, we compare our detailed prediction to the choices from the question prompt.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Check Aromatic Proton Count.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one at `6.9 ppm`.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** It shows the two doublets (`7.8`, `7.6`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted ring, and the `2.3 ppm` singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All shifts, splittings, and integrations are consistent.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identify Incorrect Functional Groups and Flawed Data.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the isomeric aldehyde, the data is chemically impossible. The adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other into a triplet and a doublet, not the two singlets shown.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Recognize the Required Aromatic Region.** There are no signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (6.5-8.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe systematic deconstruction of the question leads unequivocally to the structure of para-haloacetophenone. A careful analysis of the options shows that only one spectrum is chemically consistent with this structure. Despite the confusion in the candidate answers regarding the correct letter, a direct analysis of the question and options provided leads to a single clear solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning of the candidate agents and highlighting crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information provided in the question to identify the molecule. This process was performed correctly by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This identifies the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum reveals two key functional groups: a \"carbonyl group (C=O)\" and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (meaning a halogen atom is attached directly to the ring, Ar-X).\n\nPutting these clues together:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, such as -Cl or -Br). This group contains 0 carbons.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most stable chemical structure fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone** with the general structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This molecule has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) which must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Deduce the Isomer**\n\nNext, we must predict the spectrum. The arrangement of substituents (ortho, meta, or para) is key, and the options provide a major clue.\n\n*   **Inferring the Isomer:** A key pattern is visible in the provided options: two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are **doublets (d)** that integrate to **two protons (2H)** each. This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry in this isomer simplifies the spectrum significantly compared to the more complex patterns expected for ortho or meta isomers.\n*   **Predicting the Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. The signals will be downfield (high ppm value, >7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, their signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to 3H. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the 2.1-2.6 ppm range.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm. We will now evaluate the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, the spectrum is internally inconsistent, as the two singlets for the side chain are not chemically plausible.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a perfect match. It shows the two doublets `(7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d))` for a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3 (3H, s)` signal for the acetyl methyl group. The integration (2+2+3 = 7 protons) is correct for a C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows one. The signals are in the wrong regions, and the integration is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (> 6.5 ppm), which is a requirement for this molecule.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The foundational step is to correctly combine all pieces of information (carbon count, functional groups, core structure) to arrive at the correct molecular formula and class of compound (haloacetophenone). All candidate analyses succeeded here.\n2.  **Using the Answers to Inform the Question:** A key analytical skill is using the simplicity of the NMR options (specifically, the clean two-doublet pattern) to infer the correct isomer (*para*) without having to predict the complex spectra for the *ortho* and *meta* alternatives.\n3.  **Confirming Functional Groups:** It is essential to check for consistency. The presence of an aldehyde peak at ~9.9 ppm (Option A) is a clear contradiction to the acetyl group (-COCH₃) deduced from the carbon count and FTIR data. This allows for confident rejection of that option.\n4.  **Final Mapping Check:** A significant point of error among the candidate agents was incorrectly mapping their correct chemical analysis to the option letters (A, B, C, D) from the prompt. While the chemical reasoning was sound, this final administrative step led to many incorrect final answers. It is crucial to re-read the original options and match the correct spectrum—`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`—to its corresponding letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure a robust and accurate conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The aromatic ring (benzene) itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of Substituents.** We can now logically determine the two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this C₂H₃O description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that will be visible in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.**\nThe splitting pattern in option (D) shows two distinct signals in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to two protons, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. Ortho and meta isomers would produce more complex splitting patterns. This allows us to confidently identify the molecule as **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nWith this structure in mind, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Diagnostic Chemical Shifts.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone functional group we deduced. This option describes a different molecule.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in the aromatic region and has incorrect integration for other signals.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate responses and highlighting key points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure**\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the compound from the information given in the question. The reasoning for this is unanimous and robust across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" → This is a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄XY). It has 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens on the ring itself.\n*   **Carbon Count:** \"8 carbon atoms in total\" → Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents (X and Y) must have a combined total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):**\n    *   \"aromatic-halogen bond\" → One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br). This group contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n    *   \"carbonyl group\" → The molecule contains a C=O group.\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (0 carbons).\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The only common and stable group with this composition (C₂H₃O) is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\nNow we must predict what the spectrum for this molecule should look like. A critical clue comes from the options provided.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from the Options.** The problem doesn't state if the substitution is ortho, meta, or para. However, the spectra in the options provide a clear hint. The pattern of two clean **doublets (d)** in the aromatic region, each integrating to **two protons (2H)**, is the classic, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicted Signals for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two signals, each a doublet, each integrating to 2H. These will be in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ 7.0-8.0 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl methyl group (-CH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Their signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to 3H. Its characteristic chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Provided Options**\nWe must now systematically compare our prediction—`two 2H doublets (aromatic) + one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`—against the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups.** The peak at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced. This spectrum describes a different molecule, and even so, is chemically flawed (the aldehyde and CH₂ protons would split each other, not appear as two singlets).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Verifying Proton Count.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on the para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, with the correct integration and a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2 + 2 + 3 = 7H) matches the formula C₈H₇XO.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Checking Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm) and thus cannot represent this molecule.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe chemical information overwhelmingly points to the structure being a *para*-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data provided in option C is the only choice that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns. While many candidate answers came to the correct *chemical* conclusion, some mislabeled the final letter; a direct comparison of the evidence to the original prompt confirms C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the information provided in the question to identify the unknown compound.\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total\". A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must have a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum shows an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone** (structure: X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Analyze Isomerism**\n\nNext, we predict the NMR spectrum. The two substituents can be in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* arrangement. The signal patterns in the answer choices provide a strong clue.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from the Spectrum.** Several options show a simple, highly characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (`7.8 (2H, d)`). This symmetric `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. Other isomers (*ortho* or *meta*) would produce more complex, less symmetric splitting patterns.\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. The chemical shifts will be downfield (high ppm, >7.0) due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the halogen and acetyl groups.\n    2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** One signal, a **singlet (s)**, integrating to **3H**. It is a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Option against the Prediction**\n\nWe now match our prediction—two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic)—against the options provided in the prompt.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing Aromatic Region.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO), not the ketone (-COCH₃) we deduced. **Careful Point 4: Checking for Chemical Inconsistency.** Even if the structure were an aldehyde, this spectrum is flawed. The adjacent aldehyde proton and methylene protons (-CH₂CHO) would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet, not two singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** It has two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and a 3-proton singlet at a characteristic chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group. **Careful Point 5: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2 + 2 + 3 = 7H) is correct for the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical analysis of the provided information leads to the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The ¹H NMR data presented in option C is the only choice that is fully and accurately consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns. While many of the candidate agents had confusing answer lettering, their chemical reasoning was sound and overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached. A key detail here is that a di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring itself.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total\". The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 of these carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum confirms the presence of an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n*   **Assembly:** We combine these facts to deduce the complete structure:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** The molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, and it contains 7 total hydrogen atoms that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Infer the Isomerism**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** The problem does not state whether the substituents are *ortho*, *meta*, or *para*. However, the answer choices provide a crucial clue. Option B shows a highly symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region: two clean doublets, each integrating to two protons (`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`). This specific pattern is a textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** Based on the deduction that the molecule is *para*-haloacetophenone, we can predict its full spectrum:\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as **two doublets (d)** in the downfield region (high ppm), each integrating to **2H**. This is due to the two distinct, symmetrical sets of protons on the ring splitting each other.\n    2.  **Acetyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, typically with a chemical shift around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now rigorously evaluate each option based on our prediction of two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically >6.5 ppm), which is a requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a perfect match for our prediction. It shows the two doublets (`7.8 (2H, d)`, `7.6 (2H, d)`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3 (3H, s)` signal for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. The total integration (2+2+3=7H) is also correct.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Checking Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one in the aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Identifying Inconsistent Spectra.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible. The adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet respectively, not the two singlets shown. This is a classic \"distracter\" answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate answers and applying it to the specific question provided.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the information provided in the question to determine the identity of the compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** There are \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must have a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** Spectroscopy indicates the presence of a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (meaning a halogen atom like F, Cl, or Br is attached directly to the ring).\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to a single logical conclusion, as identified by all candidate agents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This group contains 0 carbons.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest, most stable chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has 7 hydrogen atoms that will appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNext, we must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone and determine its specific substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** A crucial step is to examine the splitting patterns in the provided options. Options A and C in the prompt list a distinct aromatic region with **two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H)**. This specific pattern is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This allows us to confidently identify the isomer.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Will appear as **two doublets (d)** in the downfield region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm), with each doublet integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons, so their signal will not be split. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, typically in the chemical shift range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets` + `one 3H singlet`. We must evaluate the options as they are presented in the question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is a **perfect match** to our prediction for para-haloacetophenone. It shows two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons and a 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, all in the expected chemical shift regions.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Checking Proton Integration.** This is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups and Flawed Data.** This is incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone we deduced from the problem's clues. Furthermore, the spectrum is chemically impossible for the corresponding aldehyde structure; the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet, not two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Recognizing the Expected Chemical Shift Regions.** This is incorrect as it lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nThe chemical analysis unanimously and correctly identifies the compound as para-haloacetophenone. The predicted ¹H NMR spectrum for this molecule matches the data provided in option A exactly. While the candidate answers show confusion over the lettering of the options (likely due to them being randomized in different test instances), their underlying chemical reasoning is sound and points to the same spectral data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting key analytical points.\n\n### **Step 1: Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must determine the chemical structure of the compound from the information given in the question. This reasoning is universally agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total\". The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum shows an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" and a \"carbonyl group (C=O)\".\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, e.g., -F, -Cl, -Br). This group contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Analyze Isomerism**\n\nNext, we must predict what the ¹H NMR spectrum of this compound should look like. The answer choices themselves provide a crucial clue.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Using the Options to Determine the Isomer.** The options present NMR spectra with simple, clean splitting patterns. Specifically, the pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons (`(2H, d), (2H, d)`), is a textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This allows us to confidently identify the specific isomer.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct sets of protons on the ring. They split each other's signals to produce **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. These signals will appear downfield (high ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-COCH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that contains two 2H doublets in the aromatic region (δ > 6.5 ppm) and one 3H singlet in the aliphatic region (δ ~2.3 ppm).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Check Proton Count.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identify Inconsistent Functional Groups and Splitting.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, even for the corresponding aldehyde structure, the splitting is chemically flawed—the aldehyde proton (-CHO) and adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other into a triplet and doublet, respectively, not two singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match for *para*-haloacetophenone. It has the two 2H doublets for the para-substituted ring and the 3H singlet for the acetyl group, all in the correct chemical shift regions. The total integration (2+2+3=7H) is also correct.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Know Characteristic Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (δ > 6.5 ppm) and therefore cannot represent the described compound.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe chemical reasoning unambiguously leads to the structure of *para*-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data presented in option C is the only choice that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring provides 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** The spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (a halogen is attached to the ring) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This contributes 0 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common, stable group with this composition (-C₂H₃O) is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The total number of protons to account for in the ¹H NMR is 4 on the ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Isomer Identification:** The provided answer choices show simple splitting patterns (doublets and singlets). A highly characteristic pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring due to its symmetry. Other isomers (ortho, meta) would produce more complex splitting.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two signals, each a **doublet (d)** due to splitting by an adjacent proton, and each integrating to **2H**. These signals appear downfield (high ppm) because both the halogen and acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** One signal, which is a **singlet (s)** because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon to cause splitting. It integrates to **3H** and has a characteristic chemical shift of ~2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for a spectrum with two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is a **perfect match**. It shows two doublets for the 4 para-substituted aromatic protons and one singlet for the 3 acetyl methyl protons. The chemical shifts and integrations (2+2+3=7H) are all correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows one.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, the spectrum is chemically impossible as the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other (into a triplet and doublet), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect because it lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically >6.5 ppm).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The structure should be deduced logically from all available information (carbon count, ring type, functional groups) rather than by guessing. This reliably leads to haloacetophenone.\n2.  **Using Splitting Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** The pattern of `two 2H doublets` is a critical clue that immediately points to a para-substituted ring, simplifying the problem significantly.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** The singlet at ~2.3 ppm is highly indicative of an acetyl methyl group, while the peak at ~9.9 ppm in another option is a red flag for an incorrect aldehyde functional group.\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** Option C should be rejected not only because it represents an aldehyde but also because the splitting pattern shown (two singlets for the side chain) violates basic coupling rules (the n+1 rule).\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** The sum of protons in the correct spectrum must match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular structure (C₈H₇XO has 7 protons). Only Option A has signals that integrate correctly to 7H and match the predicted splitting.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the ¹H NMR data in option A is the only one that correctly and completely describes the specified compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and adding key points for clarity.\n\n### **Step 1: Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must determine the chemical structure of the compound from the clues in the question.\n\n*   **Base Structure & Carbon Count**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with 8 total carbons. A benzene ring provides 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR)**: The spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X) and the other contains a carbonyl group.\n*   **Assembling the Structure**:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Substituent.** The most common and stable chemical group with the formula C₂H₃O containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound is a **haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). The total number of protons to be accounted for is 7 (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nWe need to match the predicted spectrum for haloacetophenone with the given options. The substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*) is key.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using Spectral Patterns to Infer Isomerism.** The provided options include spectra with a very distinct pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet (`d`), each integrating to two protons (`2H`). This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone**:\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H)**: Will appear as **two doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ 7.0-8.5 ppm), with each signal integrating to **2H**.\n    2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H)**: Will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. It is a singlet because it is not adjacent to any other protons. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the aliphatic region, typically around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm) and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Checking Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a **perfect match** for *para*-haloacetophenone. It has the two required doublets in the aromatic region (`7.8` and `7.6 ppm`) and the 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group at a characteristic chemical shift (`2.3 ppm`).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 5: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO), which contradicts the ketone structure we deduced. Furthermore, even if the structure were the corresponding aldehyde, the splitting is chemically impossible; the aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other into a triplet and doublet, respectively, not the two singlets shown.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical information leads to the structure of *para*-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data provided in option C is the only choice that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton count (integration), and signal splitting.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Deduce the Molecular Structure\n\nFirst, we analyze the clues given in the question to determine the identity of the compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** There are \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, which means the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nCombining these clues, we can assemble the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). Halogens contribute 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most stable chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**, with the general structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Specific Isomer\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can determine the specific isomer by analyzing the patterns presented in the options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Using the Options to Determine Isomerism.** The spectral data in option B, `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`, shows a highly characteristic pattern of two clean doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This simple pattern is a textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n\nWith this knowledge, we can predict the full spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone**:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct sets of protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. These signals are expected to be downfield (high ppm, >7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the -CH₃ group are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, this signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Original Options Against the Prediction\n\nNow, we compare our firm prediction against the four options provided in the initial question prompt.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group.\n        *   The chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integrations (2+2+3 = 7 protons) are all correct for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups.** This is incorrect. The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde (-CHO)**, not the ketone (-COCH₃) we deduced from the problem's clues.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Correct Chemical Shift Regions.** This is incorrect as it lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The chemical reasoning is clear and consistent across all competent analyses: the compound is para-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data presented in option B is the only choice that accurately and completely matches the predicted spectrum for this structure. The confusion in the candidate answers stems from evaluating a scrambled list of options, but a direct analysis of the original question unequivocally points to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the consensus from the candidate agents and identifying key points of consideration.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Provided Clues**\nThis initial step is the foundation of the problem, and all candidate agents reached a correct and unanimous conclusion.\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring with two functional groups attached (C₆H₄XY).\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself provides 6 carbons, leaving a combined total of 2 carbons for the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The molecule contains an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" and a \"carbonyl group (C=O).\"\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This contains zero carbon atoms.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    3.  The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Deduce Isomerism**\nThis step involves interpreting the clues given in the answer options to determine the substitution pattern.\n*   **Inferring the Isomer:** A key feature in several options is a pair of downfield doublets, each integrating to two protons. This simple `(2H, d)...(2H, d)` pattern in the aromatic region is a classic signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicting the Full Spectrum:** Based on the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**:\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct sets of protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, so these signals will appear downfield (high ppm).\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons). Its signal will therefore not be split, appearing as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the 2.1-2.6 ppm range.\n*   **Summary of Prediction:** We are looking for a spectrum with two 2H doublets in the aromatic region (~7-8 ppm) and one 3H singlet in the aliphatic region (~2.3 ppm).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Original Question's Options**\nNow, we match our prediction against the choices provided in the prompt.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically > 6.5 ppm).\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one in the aromatic region, and the total integration pattern is incorrect for our structure.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction of para-haloacetophenone. It has the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted ring (`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`), and a 3-proton singlet at a characteristic chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group (`2.3 (3H, s)`). The total integration (2+2+3 = 7H) is also correct.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum is inconsistent for two reasons. First, the signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not the ketone (-COCH₃) we deduced. Second, even if the molecule were the isomeric aldehyde, the splitting is chemically flawed. The adjacent aldehyde proton and methylene (-CH₂) protons would split each other (into a triplet and doublet, respectively), but they are shown as two non-interacting singlets.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Confusion in Candidate Labeling:** The provided candidate answers demonstrate strong and consistent chemical reasoning, but their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent. This indicates a likely mix-up in the labeling of options in their source material. The correct approach is to trust the consensus on the chemical reasoning and re-evaluate the original options from scratch, as done above.\n2.  **Using Spectrum Clues:** The simplicity of the splitting patterns in the options is a major clue that points toward the symmetrical *para* isomer. A less symmetrical *ortho* or *meta* isomer would produce a more complex multiplet in the aromatic region.\n3.  **Cross-validating All Data:** A candidate spectrum must be consistent in all aspects: chemical shifts, splitting patterns (multiplicity), and integration (proton count). Option (D) is a good example of a distractor that can be eliminated on multiple grounds (wrong functional group *and* flawed splitting).\n4.  **Verifying Proton Count:** Always do a quick check to see if the integrations add up to the expected number of protons. The structure is C₈H₇XO (7 protons). The integrations for Option (C) are 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H, which is a perfect match.\n\nBased on the overwhelming and consistent chemical reasoning, the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound is that listed in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The aromatic ring is benzene, which accounts for 6 carbons. This leaves 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR)**: The spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure**:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. The total number of protons to be accounted for is 7 (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum and Infer the Isomer**\n\nThe key is to use the patterns in the answer choices to determine the substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** The NMR data in option D presents a highly symmetrical and characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet (`d`), each integrating to two protons (`2H`). This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which split each other's signals into clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently identify the compound as **para-haloacetophenone** and predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two doublets in the downfield region (typically 7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2H.\n2.  **Acetyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so its signal is not split. It will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to 3H, typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Original Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for a spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` + `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (> 6.5 ppm), which is a requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Checking Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one (`6.9 (1H, s)`). The total integration is also incorrect for our deduced structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Identifying Functional Groups and Flawed Splitting.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO), not the ketone (-COCH₃) we deduced. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible. The adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other into a triplet and a doublet, not the two singlets shown.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a **perfect match** for para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2+2+3=7H) is correct for a C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidates and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues in the problem statement to identify the unknown compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This tells us the base molecule is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** There are \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms to be accounted for in the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum confirms the presence of a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X).\n\nLet's assemble these clues to build the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This group contains 0 carbons.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Deducing the Substituent.** The most common and chemically stable group with the formula C₂H₃O and containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the molecular structure is a **haloacetophenone**. Its formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there must be a total of 7 hydrogen atoms in the structure (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group). This is a critical check for the ¹H NMR integration.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* position. The data in the options allows us to determine the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying Isomerism from Splitting Patterns.** Option C presents a very clear aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet, each integrating to two protons (`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`). This pattern is the unmistakable, textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The molecule's symmetry creates two distinct sets of equivalent protons, which split each other into clean doublets. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, multi-peak patterns.\n\nWith the structure identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** As established, these will appear as two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will be in the downfield region (high ppm value) due to the electron-withdrawing nature of both the halogen and acetyl groups.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-COCH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**.\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Using Characteristic Chemical Shifts.** The typical chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group is δ 2.1-2.6 ppm. The protons on the aromatic ring will be in the δ 6.5-8.5 ppm range. An aldehyde proton, by contrast, would be much further downfield at δ 9-10 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Checking for Internal Consistency.** This spectrum is chemically flawed. The side-chain protons of the corresponding aldehyde ((p-halophenyl)acetaldehyde) would be -CH₂-CHO. These protons are adjacent and must split each other (into a doublet and a triplet), but they are incorrectly shown as singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a perfect match.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 5: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H, which perfectly matches the 7 protons in our C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one in the aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll evidence from the problem statement leads to the structure of para-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data provided in option C is the only choice that is fully and accurately consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, integration, and splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups. This structure has 4 hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring provides 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The total number of protons to be accounted for in the ¹H NMR is 7 (4 on the ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from the Options.** The problem's answer choices provide a major clue. The presence of two clean doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons (`2H, d`), is a classic textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry in the para isomer creates two distinct sets of equivalent protons that split each other, simplifying the spectrum. Other isomers (*ortho*, *meta*) would produce more complex splitting patterns not seen in the correct option.\n*   **Prediction for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** We expect **two doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ > 7.0 ppm), with each signal integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group's methyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, their signal will be a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Summary:** The correct spectrum must show two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe now compare our prediction against the specific options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is a **perfect match**. It shows the two doublets (`7.8` and `7.6 ppm`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring, and the singlet (`2.3 ppm`) for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns are correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This is incorrect as it has no signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically δ 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Checking Proton Integration.** This is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups and Flawed Data.** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone functional group we deduced. Second, even if the molecule were the isomeric aldehyde ((p-halophenyl)acetaldehyde), the spectrum is chemically impossible; the adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other's signals (into a triplet and a doublet, respectively), but they are incorrectly shown as singlets.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemical information overwhelmingly points to the structure being para-haloacetophenone.

The spectral data in the options provides a strong clue to the correct arrangement.\n*   **Inferring Isomerism from the Spectrum:** A key pattern visible in the options is a set of two distinct signals in the aromatic region (downfield), both of which are **doublets (d)** that each integrate to **two protons (2H)**. This simple `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two **doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ 7.0-8.5 ppm), each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group's methyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting. Their signal will be a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the aliphatic region, typically around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now rigorously evaluate each option provided in the question based on our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` + `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a perfect match for our prediction. It shows the two doublets (`7.8` and `7.6`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3` singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integrations (2+2+3=7H) are correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one in the correct region (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically > 6.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum is flawed for two reasons. First, the signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Second, even if the molecule were the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible; the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would have to split each other's signals, but they are incorrectly shown as two non-interacting singlets.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The most reliable path to the answer is to first deduce the molecular structure (para-haloacetophenone) by systematically combining all clues from the question (carbon count, ring type, functional groups).\n2.  **Using Splitting Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** The `two 2H doublets` pattern in the aromatic region is a critical shortcut that points directly to a para-substituted ring, simplifying the problem significantly.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** The singlet around ~2.3 ppm is highly indicative of an acetyl methyl group, while the peak at ~9.9 ppm in option D is a clear indicator of a different functional group (aldehyde) and allows for its immediate rejection.\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** A correct answer must be chemically plausible in all respects. Option D fails this test because it shows protons on adjacent carbons that are not split, violating fundamental NMR coupling rules.\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** The sum of protons in the correct spectrum (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H) must match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular formula (C₈H₇XO), providing a final confirmation.\n\n<<<A>>>"

One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, such as Cl or Br). This group contains 0 carbons.\n2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there are 7 hydrogen atoms to account for in the ¹H NMR spectrum (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Analyze the Options**\n\nWe now need to match the spectrum of a haloacetophenone to the given options. The key is to deduce the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) from the data provided.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from the Spectrum**\nThe NMR data presented in the options is the biggest clue. Option B shows a distinct aromatic pattern: `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two clean doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The molecule's high degree of symmetry results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring, which split each other into two doublets. This allows us to confidently identify the isomer.\n\nWith the structure identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. Chemical shifts will be downfield (high ppm) in the aromatic range (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any protons, so their signal will be a singlet (s) integrating to 3H. Their typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Total Integration:** The total proton count should be 4 (aromatic) + 3 (methyl) = 7H.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nNow, we compare our detailed prediction to the choices from the question prompt.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Check Aromatic Proton Count.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one at `6.9 ppm`.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** It shows the two doublets (`7.8`, `7.6`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted ring, and the `2.3 ppm` singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All shifts, splittings, and integrations are consistent.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identify Incorrect Functional Groups and Flawed Data.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the isomeric aldehyde, the data is chemically impossible. The adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other into a triplet and a doublet, not the two singlets shown.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Recognize the Required Aromatic Region.** There are no signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (6.5-8.5 ppm), which is an absolute requirement for this molecule.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe systematic deconstruction of the question leads unequivocally to the structure of para-haloacetophenone. A careful analysis of the options shows that only one spectrum is chemically consistent with this structure. Despite the confusion in the candidate answers regarding the correct letter, a direct analysis of the question and options provided leads to a single clear solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning of the candidate agents and highlighting crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information provided in the question to identify the molecule. This process was performed correctly by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This identifies the base as a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum reveals two key functional groups: a \"carbonyl group (C=O)\" and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (meaning a halogen atom is attached directly to the ring, Ar-X).\n\nPutting these clues together:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, such as -Cl or -Br). This group contains 0 carbons.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most stable chemical structure fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone** with the general structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This molecule has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) which must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Deduce the Isomer**\n\nNext, we must predict the spectrum. The arrangement of substituents (ortho, meta, or para) is key, and the options provide a major clue.\n\n*   **Inferring the Isomer:** A key pattern is visible in the provided options: two signals in the aromatic region, both of which are **doublets (d)** that integrate to **two protons (2H)** each. This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is the classic, textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry in this isomer simplifies the spectrum significantly compared to the more complex patterns expected for ortho or meta isomers.\n*   **Predicting the Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. The signals will be downfield (high ppm value, >7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, their signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to 3H. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the 2.1-2.6 ppm range.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm. We will now evaluate the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, the spectrum is internally inconsistent, as the two singlets for the side chain are not chemically plausible.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a perfect match. It shows the two doublets `(7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d))` for a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3 (3H, s)` signal for the acetyl methyl group. The integration (2+2+3 = 7 protons) is correct for a C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows one. The signals are in the wrong regions, and the integration is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (> 6.5 ppm), which is a requirement for this molecule.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The foundational step is to correctly combine all pieces of information (carbon count, functional groups, core structure) to arrive at the correct molecular formula and class of compound (haloacetophenone). All candidate analyses succeeded here.\n2.  **Using the Answers to Inform the Question:** A key analytical skill is using the simplicity of the NMR options (specifically, the clean two-doublet pattern) to infer the correct isomer (*para*) without having to predict the complex spectra for the *ortho* and *meta* alternatives.\n3.  **Confirming Functional Groups:** It is essential to check for consistency. The presence of an aldehyde peak at ~9.9 ppm (Option A) is a clear contradiction to the acetyl group (-COCH₃) deduced from the carbon count and FTIR data. This allows for confident rejection of that option.\n4.  **Final Mapping Check:** A significant point of error among the candidate agents was incorrectly mapping their correct chemical analysis to the option letters (A, B, C, D) from the prompt. While the chemical reasoning was sound, this final administrative step led to many incorrect final answers. It is crucial to re-read the original options and match the correct spectrum—`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`—to its corresponding letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to ensure a robust and accurate conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues from the question to determine the chemical structure of the unknown compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The aromatic ring (benzene) itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** The infrared spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Systematic Deduction of Substituents.** We can now logically determine the two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes **0 carbon atoms**.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both the remaining **2 carbon atoms** and the **carbonyl group**.\n*   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this C₂H₃O description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that will be visible in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can use the patterns in the answer options to deduce the specific arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Using the Options to Infer Isomerism.**\nThe splitting pattern in option (D) shows two distinct signals in the aromatic region: `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to two protons, is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. Ortho and meta isomers would produce more complex splitting patterns. This allows us to confidently identify the molecule as **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nWith this structure in mind, we can predict its full ¹H NMR spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will appear at a high chemical shift (downfield) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, it will appear as an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Diagnostic Chemical Shifts.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone functional group we deduced. This option describes a different molecule.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Verifying Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in the aromatic region and has incorrect integration for other signals.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a **perfect match** for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` are the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)` is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, appearing at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2+2+3=7H) matches the number of protons in the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate responses and highlighting key points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure**\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of the compound from the information given in the question. The reasoning for this is unanimous and robust across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" → This is a benzene ring with two groups attached (C₆H₄XY). It has 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens on the ring itself.\n*   **Carbon Count:** \"8 carbon atoms in total\" → Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents (X and Y) must have a combined total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):**\n    *   \"aromatic-halogen bond\" → One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br). This group contains **0 carbon atoms**.\n    *   \"carbonyl group\" → The molecule contains a C=O group.\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (0 carbons).\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The only common and stable group with this composition (C₂H₃O) is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group) that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\nNow we must predict what the spectrum for this molecule should look like. A critical clue comes from the options provided.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from the Options.** The problem doesn't state if the substitution is ortho, meta, or para. However, the spectra in the options provide a clear hint. The pattern of two clean **doublets (d)** in the aromatic region, each integrating to **two protons (2H)**, is the classic, textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicted Signals for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two signals, each a doublet, each integrating to 2H. These will be in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ 7.0-8.0 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl methyl group (-CH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Their signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to 3H. Its characteristic chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Provided Options**\nWe must now systematically compare our prediction—`two 2H doublets (aromatic) + one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`—against the options from the original question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups.** The peak at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced. This spectrum describes a different molecule, and even so, is chemically flawed (the aldehyde and CH₂ protons would split each other, not appear as two singlets).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Verifying Proton Count.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on the para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, with the correct integration and a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2 + 2 + 3 = 7H) matches the formula C₈H₇XO.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Checking Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm) and thus cannot represent this molecule.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe chemical information overwhelmingly points to the structure being a *para*-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data provided in option C is the only choice that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns. While many candidate answers came to the correct *chemical* conclusion, some mislabeled the final letter; a direct comparison of the evidence to the original prompt confirms C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the information provided in the question to identify the unknown compound.\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total\". A benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must have a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum shows an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone** (structure: X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum and Analyze Isomerism**\n\nNext, we predict the NMR spectrum. The two substituents can be in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* arrangement. The signal patterns in the answer choices provide a strong clue.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from the Spectrum.** Several options show a simple, highly characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (`7.8 (2H, d)`). This symmetric `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. Other isomers (*ortho* or *meta*) would produce more complex, less symmetric splitting patterns.\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. The chemical shifts will be downfield (high ppm, >7.0) due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the halogen and acetyl groups.\n    2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** One signal, a **singlet (s)**, integrating to **3H**. It is a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Option against the Prediction**\n\nWe now match our prediction—two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic)—against the options provided in the prompt.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing Aromatic Region.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO), not the ketone (-COCH₃) we deduced. **Careful Point 4: Checking for Chemical Inconsistency.** Even if the structure were an aldehyde, this spectrum is flawed. The adjacent aldehyde proton and methylene protons (-CH₂CHO) would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet, not two singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** It has two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and a 3-proton singlet at a characteristic chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group. **Careful Point 5: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration (2 + 2 + 3 = 7H) is correct for the C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical analysis of the provided information leads to the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**. The ¹H NMR data presented in option C is the only choice that is fully and accurately consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns. While many of the candidate agents had confusing answer lettering, their chemical reasoning was sound and overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached. A key detail here is that a di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring itself.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total\". The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 of these carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum confirms the presence of an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\n*   **Assembly:** We combine these facts to deduce the complete structure:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X, e.g., -Cl, -Br), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** The molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, and it contains 7 total hydrogen atoms that must appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Infer the Isomerism**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** The problem does not state whether the substituents are *ortho*, *meta*, or *para*. However, the answer choices provide a crucial clue. Option B shows a highly symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region: two clean doublets, each integrating to two protons (`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`). This specific pattern is a textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** Based on the deduction that the molecule is *para*-haloacetophenone, we can predict its full spectrum:\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** These will appear as **two doublets (d)** in the downfield region (high ppm), each integrating to **2H**. This is due to the two distinct, symmetrical sets of protons on the ring splitting each other.\n    2.  **Acetyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, typically with a chemical shift around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe will now rigorously evaluate each option based on our prediction of two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically >6.5 ppm), which is a requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This option is a perfect match for our prediction. It shows the two doublets (`7.8 (2H, d)`, `7.6 (2H, d)`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring and the `2.3 (3H, s)` signal for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. The total integration (2+2+3=7H) is also correct.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Checking Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one in the aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Identifying Inconsistent Spectra.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** functional group, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible. The adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet respectively, not the two singlets shown. This is a classic \"distracter\" answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the unanimous chemical reasoning from the candidate answers and applying it to the specific question provided.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the information provided in the question to determine the identity of the compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** There are \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must have a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** Spectroscopy indicates the presence of a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (meaning a halogen atom like F, Cl, or Br is attached directly to the ring).\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to a single logical conclusion, as identified by all candidate agents:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This group contains 0 carbons.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest, most stable chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has 7 hydrogen atoms that will appear in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNext, we must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone and determine its specific substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** A crucial step is to examine the splitting patterns in the provided options. Options A and C in the prompt list a distinct aromatic region with **two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H)**. This specific pattern is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This allows us to confidently identify the isomer.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Will appear as **two doublets (d)** in the downfield region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm), with each doublet integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons, so their signal will not be split. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**, typically in the chemical shift range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets` + `one 3H singlet`. We must evaluate the options as they are presented in the question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is a **perfect match** to our prediction for para-haloacetophenone. It shows two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons and a 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group, all in the expected chemical shift regions.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Checking Proton Integration.** This is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups and Flawed Data.** This is incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone we deduced from the problem's clues. Furthermore, the spectrum is chemically impossible for the corresponding aldehyde structure; the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other, producing a triplet and a doublet, not two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Recognizing the Expected Chemical Shift Regions.** This is incorrect as it lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nThe chemical analysis unanimously and correctly identifies the compound as para-haloacetophenone. The predicted ¹H NMR spectrum for this molecule matches the data provided in option A exactly. While the candidate answers show confusion over the lettering of the options (likely due to them being randomized in different test instances), their underlying chemical reasoning is sound and points to the same spectral data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting key analytical points.\n\n### **Step 1: Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must determine the chemical structure of the compound from the information given in the question. This reasoning is universally agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total\". The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum shows an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" and a \"carbonyl group (C=O)\".\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, e.g., -F, -Cl, -Br). This group contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Analyze Isomerism**\n\nNext, we must predict what the ¹H NMR spectrum of this compound should look like. The answer choices themselves provide a crucial clue.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Using the Options to Determine the Isomer.** The options present NMR spectra with simple, clean splitting patterns. Specifically, the pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons (`(2H, d), (2H, d)`), is a textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. This allows us to confidently identify the specific isomer.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct sets of protons on the ring. They split each other's signals to produce **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. These signals will appear downfield (high ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-COCH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that contains two 2H doublets in the aromatic region (δ > 6.5 ppm) and one 3H singlet in the aliphatic region (δ ~2.3 ppm).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Check Proton Count.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Identify Inconsistent Functional Groups and Splitting.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde**, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, even for the corresponding aldehyde structure, the splitting is chemically flawed—the aldehyde proton (-CHO) and adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other into a triplet and doublet, respectively, not two singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match for *para*-haloacetophenone. It has the two 2H doublets for the para-substituted ring and the 3H singlet for the acetyl group, all in the correct chemical shift regions. The total integration (2+2+3=7H) is also correct.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Know Characteristic Chemical Shift Regions.** This spectrum completely lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (δ > 6.5 ppm) and therefore cannot represent the described compound.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe chemical reasoning unambiguously leads to the structure of *para*-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data presented in option C is the only choice that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton integration, and signal splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring provides 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the two substituents combined.\n*   **Functional Groups (FTIR):** The spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (a halogen is attached to the ring) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This contributes 0 carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common, stable group with this composition (-C₂H₃O) is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The total number of protons to account for in the ¹H NMR is 4 on the ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Isomer Identification:** The provided answer choices show simple splitting patterns (doublets and singlets). A highly characteristic pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring due to its symmetry. Other isomers (ortho, meta) would produce more complex splitting.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two signals, each a **doublet (d)** due to splitting by an adjacent proton, and each integrating to **2H**. These signals appear downfield (high ppm) because both the halogen and acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** One signal, which is a **singlet (s)** because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon to cause splitting. It integrates to **3H** and has a characteristic chemical shift of ~2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for a spectrum with two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ppm: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is a **perfect match**. It shows two doublets for the 4 para-substituted aromatic protons and one singlet for the 3 acetyl methyl protons. The chemical shifts and integrations (2+2+3=7H) are all correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ppm: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows one.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ppm: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced. Furthermore, the spectrum is chemically impossible as the adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other (into a triplet and doublet), not appear as two singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ppm: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect because it lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically >6.5 ppm).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Systematic Structure Deduction:** The structure should be deduced logically from all available information (carbon count, ring type, functional groups) rather than by guessing. This reliably leads to haloacetophenone.\n2.  **Using Splitting Patterns to Infer Isomerism:** The pattern of `two 2H doublets` is a critical clue that immediately points to a para-substituted ring, simplifying the problem significantly.\n3.  **Recognizing Diagnostic Chemical Shifts:** The singlet at ~2.3 ppm is highly indicative of an acetyl methyl group, while the peak at ~9.9 ppm in another option is a red flag for an incorrect aldehyde functional group.\n4.  **Checking for Internal Consistency:** Option C should be rejected not only because it represents an aldehyde but also because the splitting pattern shown (two singlets for the side chain) violates basic coupling rules (the n+1 rule).\n5.  **Verifying Proton Integration:** The sum of protons in the correct spectrum must match the total number of protons in the deduced molecular structure (C₈H₇XO has 7 protons). Only Option A has signals that integrate correctly to 7H and match the predicted splitting.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, the ¹H NMR data in option A is the only one that correctly and completely describes the specified compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and adding key points for clarity.\n\n### **Step 1: Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, we must determine the chemical structure of the compound from the clues in the question.\n\n*   **Base Structure & Carbon Count**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with 8 total carbons. A benzene ring provides 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR)**: The spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X) and the other contains a carbonyl group.\n*   **Assembling the Structure**:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Substituent.** The most common and stable chemical group with the formula C₂H₃O containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound is a **haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). The total number of protons to be accounted for is 7 (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nWe need to match the predicted spectrum for haloacetophenone with the given options. The substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*) is key.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using Spectral Patterns to Infer Isomerism.** The provided options include spectra with a very distinct pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet (`d`), each integrating to two protons (`2H`). This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone**:\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H)**: Will appear as **two doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ 7.0-8.5 ppm), with each signal integrating to **2H**.\n    2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H)**: Will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. It is a singlet because it is not adjacent to any other protons. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the aliphatic region, typically around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that perfectly matches our prediction: two 2H doublets (aromatic) and one 3H singlet (aliphatic).\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm) and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Checking Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only shows one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in that region.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a **perfect match** for *para*-haloacetophenone. It has the two required doublets in the aromatic region (`7.8` and `7.6 ppm`) and the 3-proton singlet for the acetyl methyl group at a characteristic chemical shift (`2.3 ppm`).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 5: Identifying Contradictory and Flawed Data.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO), which contradicts the ketone structure we deduced. Furthermore, even if the structure were the corresponding aldehyde, the splitting is chemically impossible; the aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other into a triplet and doublet, respectively, not the two singlets shown.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical information leads to the structure of *para*-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data provided in option C is the only choice that is fully consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, proton count (integration), and signal splitting.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Deduce the Molecular Structure\n\nFirst, we analyze the clues given in the question to determine the identity of the compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** There are \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, which means the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n\nCombining these clues, we can assemble the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). Halogens contribute 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most stable chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**, with the general structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Specific Isomer\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* isomer. We can determine the specific isomer by analyzing the patterns presented in the options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Using the Options to Determine Isomerism.** The spectral data in option B, `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`, shows a highly characteristic pattern of two clean doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons. This simple pattern is a textbook signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n\nWith this knowledge, we can predict the full spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone**:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct sets of protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. These signals are expected to be downfield (high ppm, >7.0 ppm) because both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The three protons of the -CH₃ group are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, this signal will not be split and will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Original Options Against the Prediction\n\nNow, we compare our firm prediction against the four options provided in the initial question prompt.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one (`6.9 (1H, s)`) in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group.\n        *   The chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integrations (2+2+3 = 7 protons) are all correct for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups.** This is incorrect. The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde (-CHO)**, not the ketone (-COCH₃) we deduced from the problem's clues.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Recognizing the Correct Chemical Shift Regions.** This is incorrect as it lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ > 6.5 ppm), which is essential for this compound.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The chemical reasoning is clear and consistent across all competent analyses: the compound is para-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data presented in option B is the only choice that accurately and completely matches the predicted spectrum for this structure. The confusion in the candidate answers stems from evaluating a scrambled list of options, but a direct analysis of the original question unequivocally points to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the consensus from the candidate agents and identifying key points of consideration.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Provided Clues**\nThis initial step is the foundation of the problem, and all candidate agents reached a correct and unanimous conclusion.\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring with two functional groups attached (C₆H₄XY).\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself provides 6 carbons, leaving a combined total of 2 carbons for the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The molecule contains an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" and a \"carbonyl group (C=O).\"\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    1.  One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This contains zero carbon atoms.\n    2.  The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    3.  The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group) that must be accounted for in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Deduce Isomerism**\nThis step involves interpreting the clues given in the answer options to determine the substitution pattern.\n*   **Inferring the Isomer:** A key feature in several options is a pair of downfield doublets, each integrating to two protons. This simple `(2H, d)...(2H, d)` pattern in the aromatic region is a classic signature for a highly symmetrical **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring.\n*   **Predicting the Full Spectrum:** Based on the structure of **para-haloacetophenone**:\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct sets of protons on the ring. These split each other to form **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, so these signals will appear downfield (high ppm).\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons). Its signal will therefore not be split, appearing as a **singlet (s)** that integrates to **3H**. Its characteristic chemical shift is in the 2.1-2.6 ppm range.\n*   **Summary of Prediction:** We are looking for a spectrum with two 2H doublets in the aromatic region (~7-8 ppm) and one 3H singlet in the aliphatic region (~2.3 ppm).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Original Question's Options**\nNow, we match our prediction against the choices provided in the prompt.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum has no signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically > 6.5 ppm).\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only accounts for one in the aromatic region, and the total integration pattern is incorrect for our structure.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction of para-haloacetophenone. It has the two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted ring (`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`), and a 3-proton singlet at a characteristic chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group (`2.3 (3H, s)`). The total integration (2+2+3 = 7H) is also correct.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum is inconsistent for two reasons. First, the signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not the ketone (-COCH₃) we deduced. Second, even if the molecule were the isomeric aldehyde, the splitting is chemically flawed. The adjacent aldehyde proton and methylene (-CH₂) protons would split each other (into a triplet and doublet, respectively), but they are shown as two non-interacting singlets.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Confusion in Candidate Labeling:** The provided candidate answers demonstrate strong and consistent chemical reasoning, but their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent. This indicates a likely mix-up in the labeling of options in their source material. The correct approach is to trust the consensus on the chemical reasoning and re-evaluate the original options from scratch, as done above.\n2.  **Using Spectrum Clues:** The simplicity of the splitting patterns in the options is a major clue that points toward the symmetrical *para* isomer. A less symmetrical *ortho* or *meta* isomer would produce a more complex multiplet in the aromatic region.\n3.  **Cross-validating All Data:** A candidate spectrum must be consistent in all aspects: chemical shifts, splitting patterns (multiplicity), and integration (proton count). Option (D) is a good example of a distractor that can be eliminated on multiple grounds (wrong functional group *and* flawed splitting).\n4.  **Verifying Proton Count:** Always do a quick check to see if the integrations add up to the expected number of protons. The structure is C₈H₇XO (7 protons). The integrations for Option (C) are 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H, which is a perfect match.\n\nBased on the overwhelming and consistent chemical reasoning, the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound is that listed in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **Core Structure and Carbon Count**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The aromatic ring is benzene, which accounts for 6 carbons. This leaves 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR)**: The spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure**:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most stable and common chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. The total number of protons to be accounted for is 7 (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum and Infer the Isomer**\n\nThe key is to use the patterns in the answer choices to determine the substitution pattern (*ortho*, *meta*, or *para*).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from Spectral Patterns.** The NMR data in option D presents a highly symmetrical and characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet (`d`), each integrating to two protons (`2H`). This `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern is a classic textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which split each other's signals into clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently identify the compound as **para-haloacetophenone** and predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** Two doublets in the downfield region (typically 7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2H.\n2.  **Acetyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (which has no protons), so its signal is not split. It will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to 3H, typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Original Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for a spectrum that matches our prediction: `two 2H doublets (aromatic)` + `one 3H singlet (aliphatic)`.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 2: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical chemical shift region for aromatic protons (> 6.5 ppm), which is a requirement for this molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 3: Checking Proton Integration.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one (`6.9 (1H, s)`). The total integration is also incorrect for our deduced structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** **Careful Point 4: Identifying Functional Groups and Flawed Splitting.** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO), not the ketone (-COCH₃) we deduced. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the isomeric aldehyde, the spectrum is chemically impossible. The adjacent aldehyde and methylene protons would split each other into a triplet and a doublet, not the two singlets shown.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum is a **perfect match** for para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   The total integration (2+2+3=7H) is correct for a C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidates and highlighting crucial points of analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the clues in the problem statement to identify the unknown compound.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This tells us the base molecule is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups attached.\n*   **Carbon Count:** There are \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbon atoms to be accounted for in the two substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The infrared spectrum confirms the presence of a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X).\n\nLet's assemble these clues to build the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This group contains 0 carbons.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Deducing the Substituent.** The most common and chemically stable group with the formula C₂H₃O and containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the molecular structure is a **haloacetophenone**. Its formula is C₈H₇XO, which means there must be a total of 7 hydrogen atoms in the structure (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group). This is a critical check for the ¹H NMR integration.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum and Identify the Isomer**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* position. The data in the options allows us to determine the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying Isomerism from Splitting Patterns.** Option C presents a very clear aromatic region: two signals, each a doublet, each integrating to two protons (`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`). This pattern is the unmistakable, textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The molecule's symmetry creates two distinct sets of equivalent protons, which split each other into clean doublets. *Ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce more complex, multi-peak patterns.\n\nWith the structure identified as **para-haloacetophenone**, we can predict its full spectrum:\n1.  **Aromatic Protons (4H):** As established, these will appear as two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. They will be in the downfield region (high ppm value) due to the electron-withdrawing nature of both the halogen and acetyl groups.\n2.  **Acetyl Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-COCH₃) is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, its signal will be an unsplit **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**.\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Using Characteristic Chemical Shifts.** The typical chemical shift for an acetyl methyl group is δ 2.1-2.6 ppm. The protons on the aromatic ring will be in the δ 6.5-8.5 ppm range. An aldehyde proton, by contrast, would be much further downfield at δ 9-10 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options Against the Prediction**\n\nWe are looking for the spectrum that matches our prediction: two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and one 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This spectrum lacks any signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone we deduced.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Checking for Internal Consistency.** This spectrum is chemically flawed. The side-chain protons of the corresponding aldehyde ((p-halophenyl)acetaldehyde) would be -CH₂-CHO. These protons are adjacent and must split each other (into a doublet and a triplet), but they are incorrectly shown as singlets.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This is a perfect match.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: The two doublets for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: The singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group, at a characteristic chemical shift.\n        *   **Careful Point 5: Verifying Proton Integration.** The total integration is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H, which perfectly matches the 7 protons in our C₈H₇XO structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Incorrect.** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum only accounts for one in the aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll evidence from the problem statement leads to the structure of para-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data provided in option C is the only choice that is fully and accurately consistent with this structure in terms of chemical shifts, integration, and splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means its base is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two functional groups. This structure has 4 hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring provides 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The spectrum indicates an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (one substituent is a halogen, -X) and a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contributes 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The total number of protons to be accounted for in the ¹H NMR is 7 (4 on the ring and 3 on the methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inferring Isomerism from the Options.** The problem's answer choices provide a major clue. The presence of two clean doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons (`2H, d`), is a classic textbook signature for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The high degree of symmetry in the para isomer creates two distinct sets of equivalent protons that split each other, simplifying the spectrum. Other isomers (*ortho*, *meta*) would produce more complex splitting patterns not seen in the correct option.\n*   **Prediction for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** We expect **two doublets (d)** in the downfield aromatic region (typically δ > 7.0 ppm), with each signal integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** The three protons of the acetyl group's methyl group (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, their signal will be a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Summary:** The correct spectrum must show two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe now compare our prediction against the specific options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is a **perfect match**. It shows the two doublets (`7.8` and `7.6 ppm`) for the 4 protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring, and the singlet (`2.3 ppm`) for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group. All chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns are correct.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Recognizing the Aromatic Region.** This is incorrect as it has no signals in the characteristic chemical shift region for aromatic protons (typically δ 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Checking Proton Integration.** This is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons, but this spectrum shows only one (`6.9 (1H, s)`).\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Identifying Incorrect Functional Groups and Flawed Data.** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone functional group we deduced. Second, even if the molecule were the isomeric aldehyde ((p-halophenyl)acetaldehyde), the spectrum is chemically impossible; the adjacent aldehyde proton (-CHO) and methylene protons (-CH₂-) would split each other's signals (into a triplet and a doublet, respectively), but they are incorrectly shown as singlets.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemical information overwhelmingly points to the structure being para-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data provided in option A is the only choice that is fully and accurately consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
