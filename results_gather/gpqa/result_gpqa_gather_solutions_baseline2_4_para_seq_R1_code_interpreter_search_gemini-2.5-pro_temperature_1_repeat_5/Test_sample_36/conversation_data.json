This ylide `((CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃)` then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`).\n    *   **Product E**: The ketone's oxygen is replaced by the ylide's carbon group, coupling two identical fragments to form `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.

This attaches a second ethyl group to the carbon atom between the sulfurs. Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl functional group. Since the protected carbon atom was bonded to two ethyl groups, the product is a ketone. Product **D** is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a Wittig reaction. The reagents first form a phosphorus ylide from triphenylphosphine, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone.

A C₂ rotational axis passes through the midpoint of the central C=C bond, and it also possesses a center of inversion. This symmetry makes many groups of atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Stereoisomers)**: E/Z (or geometric) isomerism is not possible for this molecule. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon atom of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In this case, each alkene carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, there is only one possible structure.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Signals**:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments.

It possesses a C₂ rotational axis through the center of the C=C bond and a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Lack of Stereoisomers**: A critical observation is that E/Z (geometric) isomerism is **not possible** for this molecule. For E/Z isomers to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the sp² carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, there is only one unique structure.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments**: Due to the high symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two carbons of the central double bond are chemically identical. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: The four ethyl groups are equivalent to each other. Consequently, the four methylene carbons are also in identical chemical environments.

The aldehyde functional group of propionaldehyde is converted into a cyclic thioacetal using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) and a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃).\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   **Reaction:** Deprotonation. Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the acidic proton from the carbon atom situated between the two sulfur atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Umpolung):** This is a key step known as a Corey-Seebach reaction, which achieves \"umpolung\" or polarity reversal. The carbon that was originally the electrophilic center of the aldehyde is now a potent nucleophile (carbanion).\n    *   **Product B:** The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic Substitution (Sₙ2). The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane, forming a new C-C bond and adding a second ethyl group.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   **Reaction:** Deprotection. The thioacetal group is hydrolyzed, regenerating a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** Since the deprotected carbon is bonded to two ethyl groups, the product is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   **Reaction:** Wittig reaction. This process converts the ketone (D) into an alkene.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Ylide Formation):** The reagents first form a phosphorus ylide. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) form a phosphonium salt, which is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   **Reaction Product E:** The ylide reacts with 3-pentanone. The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by the C=C fragment from the ylide. The final product is formed by joining two identical fragments: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The systematic name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments by analyzing the molecular symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Symmetry):** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a center of symmetry and a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the midpoint of the central C=C double bond. This renders many atoms and groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (No Stereoisomers):** E/Z (or geometric) isomerism is **not possible** for this molecule. For E/Z isomers to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the sp² hybridized carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups, so no stereoisomers can be formed.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The symmetry also makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment.

The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized. This is a classic \"Umpolung\" (polarity reversal) reaction.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane, which is a strong nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal, regenerating a carbonyl group. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product is a ketone.\n    *   **Product D**: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, a Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and the base BuLi. The ylide is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`.\n    *   This ylide reacts with the ketone, D (3-pentanone, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon part of the ylide.\n    *   **Final Product E**: The reaction yields `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`, which is systematically named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n#### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must determine the number of chemically distinct carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of E**: 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ axis of rotation through the midpoint of the C=C bond, which makes the two halves of the molecule identical. This symmetry means that many groups of atoms are chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments**:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two central carbons of the double bond are in identical chemical environments due to symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: All four ethyl groups are equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are all equivalent. This results in **one signal**.\n\nThe total number of unique carbon environments is 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Reactions**: The synthesis involves a sequence of standard but distinct reactions: thioacetal protection, umpolung/deprotonation, Sₙ2 alkylation, thioacetal deprotection, and the Wittig reaction. A mistake in any step would lead to the wrong final product.\n2.  **The Wittig Reagent**: The alkyl halide used is 3-bromopentane, leading to a more complex ylide (`(Et)₂C=PPh₃`) than is often seen in textbook problems. This ylide reacts with 3-pentanone, which has an identical carbon skeleton.\n3.  **Symmetry of the Final Product**: The most crucial part of the final step is to recognize the high symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n4.  **No E/Z Isomerism**: A common mistake would be to assume the existence of E/Z isomers. However, for a double bond to exhibit E/Z isomerism, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In product E, each carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups, making E/Z isomerism impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step synthesis correctly yields 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.

The aldehyde functional group of propionaldehyde (`CH₃CH₂CHO`) is protected by reacting it with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT). The product, **A**, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic due to the stabilizing effect of the sulfur atoms on the resulting carbanion. This is a classic example of **\"Umpolung\"** (polarity reversal), where the normally electrophilic carbonyl carbon is converted into a nucleophile. Product **B** is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (`CH₃CH₂Br`) in an Sₙ2 alkylation reaction, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the **deprotection** (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal group, regenerating a carbonyl. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone. Product **D** is **3-pentanone**, with the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a **Wittig reaction**.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is formed. Triphenylphosphine (`PPh₃`), 3-bromopentane (`(CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr`), and BuLi react to form the phosphorus ylide: **`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`**.\n    *   The ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D). The C=O double bond of the ketone is replaced with the C=C fragment from the ylide.\n    *   The reaction effectively couples two `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` units. The final product, **E**, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n### **Part 2: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nNow we must determine the number of signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene). This corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms, which is determined by molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n    The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the center of the C=C double bond, and a center of inversion at the same point.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    Due to the high degree of symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are chemically equivalent. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are chemically equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are also all chemically equivalent. This results in **one signal**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Summing the unique environments gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Umpolung:** The conversion of the aldehyde carbon from an electrophile into a nucleophile via dithiane protection and deprotonation is a key concept in this synthesis.\n*   **Symmetry in the Wittig Reaction:** The synthesis is convergent, using two similar C3-C2-C3 fragments (one from propionaldehyde + ethyl bromide, the other from 3-bromopentane) to create a highly symmetrical final product.\n*   **Absence of E/Z Isomerism:** A critical point is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene cannot have E/Z isomers. For E/Z isomerism to be possible, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups, making the molecule inherently symmetrical with only one possible geometric form.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical synthesis produces 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.

For E/Z isomers to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, the molecule exists as only one structure.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    Due to the molecule's high symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments. They are chemically equivalent and produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent. Consequently, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other and produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are also chemically equivalent.

This attaches a second ethyl group to the carbon atom between the sulfurs. Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl functional group. Since the protected carbon atom was bonded to two ethyl groups, the product is a ketone. Product **D** is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a Wittig reaction. The reagents first form a phosphorus ylide from triphenylphosphine, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone. The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide. The final product, **E**, is formed by coupling two identical fragments, resulting in **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must determine the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by examining the symmetry of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis and Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.

Here, each of the sp² hybridized carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups, so no stereoisomers can be formed.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The symmetry also makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment. They will produce **one signal**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn total, there are three distinct types of carbon atoms in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Therefore, its ¹³C-NMR spectrum will show **3 signals**. Matching this number with the given options:\n\nA) 6\nB) 3\nC) 11\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a two-stage solution: first, determining the structure of the final product, E, through a five-step reaction sequence, and second, analyzing the symmetry of E to determine the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n#### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nLet's break down the synthesis reaction by reaction.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard protection reaction. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized. This is a classic \"Umpolung\" (polarity reversal) reaction.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane, which is a strong nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal, regenerating a carbonyl group. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product is a ketone.\n    *   **Product D**: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, a Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and the base BuLi. The ylide is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`.\n    *   This ylide reacts with the ketone, D (3-pentanone, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon part of the ylide.\n    *   **Final Product E**: The reaction yields `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`, which is systematically named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n#### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must determine the number of chemically distinct carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of E**: 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ axis of rotation through the midpoint of the C=C bond, which makes the two halves of the molecule identical. This symmetry means that many groups of atoms are chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments**:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two central carbons of the double bond are in identical chemical environments due to symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: All four ethyl groups are equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are all equivalent. This results in **one signal**.\n\nThe total number of unique carbon environments is 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Reactions**: The synthesis involves a sequence of standard but distinct reactions: thioacetal protection, umpolung/deprotonation, Sₙ2 alkylation, thioacetal deprotection, and the Wittig reaction. A mistake in any step would lead to the wrong final product.\n2.  **The Wittig Reagent**: The alkyl halide used is 3-bromopentane, leading to a more complex ylide (`(Et)₂C=PPh₃`) than is often seen in textbook problems. This ylide reacts with 3-pentanone, which has an identical carbon skeleton.\n3.  **Symmetry of the Final Product**: The most crucial part of the final step is to recognize the high symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n4.  **No E/Z Isomerism**: A common mistake would be to assume the existence of E/Z isomers. However, for a double bond to exhibit E/Z isomerism, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In product E, each carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups, making E/Z isomerism impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step synthesis correctly yields 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. A symmetry analysis of this molecule shows it has three unique carbon environments. Therefore, it will show **3 signals** in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum. Matching this number to the provided options:\n\nA) 11\nB) 3\nC) 8\nD) 6\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful consideration of the chemical principles involved.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nTo find the number of NMR signals, we must first deduce the correct structure of the final product, E, by following the five-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard **thioacetal protection** reaction. The aldehyde functional group of propionaldehyde (`CH₃CH₂CHO`) is protected by reacting it with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT). The product, **A**, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic due to the stabilizing effect of the sulfur atoms on the resulting carbanion. This is a classic example of **\"Umpolung\"** (polarity reversal), where the normally electrophilic carbonyl carbon is converted into a nucleophile. Product **B** is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (`CH₃CH₂Br`) in an Sₙ2 alkylation reaction, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the **deprotection** (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal group, regenerating a carbonyl. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone. Product **D** is **3-pentanone**, with the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a **Wittig reaction**.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is formed. Triphenylphosphine (`PPh₃`), 3-bromopentane (`(CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr`), and BuLi react to form the phosphorus ylide: **`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`**.\n    *   The ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D). The C=O double bond of the ketone is replaced with the C=C fragment from the ylide.\n    *   The reaction effectively couples two `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` units. The final product, **E**, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n### **Part 2: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nNow we must determine the number of signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene). This corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms, which is determined by molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n    The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the center of the C=C double bond, and a center of inversion at the same point.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    Due to the high degree of symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are chemically equivalent. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are chemically equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are also all chemically equivalent. This results in **one signal**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Summing the unique environments gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Umpolung:** The conversion of the aldehyde carbon from an electrophile into a nucleophile via dithiane protection and deprotonation is a key concept in this synthesis.\n*   **Symmetry in the Wittig Reaction:** The synthesis is convergent, using two similar C3-C2-C3 fragments (one from propionaldehyde + ethyl bromide, the other from 3-bromopentane) to create a highly symmetrical final product.\n*   **Absence of E/Z Isomerism:** A critical point is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene cannot have E/Z isomers. For E/Z isomerism to be possible, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups, making the molecule inherently symmetrical with only one possible geometric form.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical synthesis produces 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Analysis of its highly symmetrical structure reveals that it has exactly three unique carbon environments. Therefore, it will show **3 signals** in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 11\nB) 3\nC) 6\nD) 8\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
