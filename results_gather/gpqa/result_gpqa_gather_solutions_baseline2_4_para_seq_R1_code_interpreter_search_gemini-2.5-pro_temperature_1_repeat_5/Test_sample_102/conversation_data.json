Deconstruct the Goal\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" which implies that the reaction sequence should be highly efficient and regioselective. The order of reactions is crucial.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure\n*   The benzene ring has three substituents:\n    1.  An **acetyl group (`-COCH₃`)** at position 1. This is a deactivating and **meta-director**.\n    2.  A **bromo group (`-Br`)** at position 3. This is a deactivating but **ortho, para-director**.\n    3.  A **nitro group (`-NO₂`)** at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating and **meta-director**.\n*   The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**, meaning they are all meta to one another.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Chemical Viability of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each of the four distinct synthetic pathways presented.\n\n*   **Sequence in Option A:** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`\n    *   This pathway involves performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on a bromonitrobenzene ring.\n    *   **Flaw:** The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is a strong deactivating group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction from occurring. This is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n*   **Sequence in Option B:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`\n    *   This pathway creates aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it.\n    *   **Flaw:** This reaction fails under standard conditions. The basic amino group (`-NH₂`) of aniline acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`), poisoning the catalyst and deactivating the ring. As written, this is not a valid synthetic step.\n\n*   **Sequence in Option D:** This option, as presented by some agents, involves `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`.\n    *   **Flaw:** This sequence takes benzene, converts it to nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. It is a pointless loop that makes no progress.\n\n*   **Sequence in Option C:** `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n    This sequence represents a sophisticated, multi-step synthesis.\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation to make acetophenone, followed by bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is an efficient start.\n    2.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step involves nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directors conflict (acetyl is meta, bromo is ortho,para), leading to a **mixture of isomers**. This initially appears to be a low-yield step.\n    3.  **Step iv & v (Convergent Steps):** This is the brilliant part of the strategy. The mixture of nitro-isomers is reduced to the corresponding amino-isomers (step iv). Then, a second nitration is performed (step v). For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group (`-NH₂`) and the acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) **work together cooperatively**. They force the new nitro group to add to the same position (C5). This highly selective step **converges** the different pathways, funneling the mixture from step iii toward the correct intermediate.\n    4.  **Step vi & vii (Cleanup):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its critical role in directing the final substitution, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Options A and B contain reactions that fail under the specified conditions.\n*   Option D (as defined in the detailed breakdown) is a nonsensical loop.\n*   Option C describes a valid, albeit complex, \"convergent synthesis.\" This is a known and powerful strategy for creating complex molecules where simpler pathways are blocked. It overcomes the non-selective step (iii) by using a subsequent, highly selective step (v) to resolve the mixture, thus leading to a high *overall* yield of the final product.\n\nTherefore, the sequence presented in option C is the only chemically sound, high-yield route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** The product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are arranged in a 1,3,5-pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** The question demands a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant amounts of unwanted isomers or that fail to proceed.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction (using `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` to add the acetyl group) is crucial but has major limitations. It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also **fails** on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The inclusion of `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (forms a diazonium salt), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the diazonium salt) is a strong clue that an advanced strategy involving a temporary amino group is necessary to control the placement of the substituents.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Methodically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence first makes bromobenzene, then nitrates it to form p-bromonitrobenzene (the major isomer). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence is a pointless loop. Steps (i) through (iv) take benzene, nitrate it, reduce the nitro group to an amine, form a diazonium salt, and then remove it to regenerate the starting material, benzene. This sequence makes no progress towards the product.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating it and the ring. Although the rest of the proposed synthesis would be highly selective, this non-viable first key step makes the entire pathway incorrect as written.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence describes a sophisticated but chemically sound strategy known as a \"convergent synthesis\".\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, then brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group ensures that 3-bromoacetophenone is formed with high selectivity.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not selective because the directing effects of the acetyl group (meta) and the bromo group (ortho,para) are in conflict, leading to a mixture of isomers.\n    3.  **Step iv & v:** This is the brilliant part of the strategy. The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group, which is a powerful temporary director. Then, a second nitration is performed. In this step, the powerful amino group and the acetyl group work cooperatively to direct the new nitro group to position 5 with very high selectivity, regardless of which isomer from the previous mixture is used. This causes the different reaction pathways to **converge** on the correct substitution pattern.\n    4.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having perfectly served its directing role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain steps that are either chemically non-viable under the specified conditions or are nonsensical. Option A describes a well-established, elegant synthetic route that, despite containing one non-selective step, is designed to funnel the resulting mixture toward a single product in a subsequent, highly selective step. This \"convergent\" approach allows for a high overall yield from the starting material and represents the best and only correct answer among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting with benzene.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** The product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at C1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5 arrangement, where all three groups are *meta* to one another.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**, meaning it must be designed for high selectivity, avoiding steps that produce large amounts of difficult-to-separate isomers.\n\n### **2. Key Chemical Principles and Constraints**\n\n*   **Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitations:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, has two critical constraints relevant here:\n    1.  It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as one bearing a nitro group (-NO₂).\n    2.  It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an amino group, -NH₂), because the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n*   **Advanced Strategy:** The inclusion of `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization of -NH₂), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) strongly suggests that a sophisticated strategy is required. This involves using an amino group as a powerful, temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the principles above.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence first creates bromobenzene, then nitratates it (mostly to p-bromonitrobenzene). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence first prepares aniline (benzene → nitrobenzene → aniline). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation directly on aniline.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. Although more complex procedures exist to achieve this transformation, the sequence as written is fundamentally flawed. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop and does not advance the synthesis. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence represents a complex but sound and elegant synthetic strategy.\n        1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first converted to acetophenone, and then brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is efficient and selective.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is **not selective** because of conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is *meta*, -Br is *ortho,para*), so it produces a mixture of isomers. This appears to violate the \"high-yield\" rule.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The nitro groups on the entire mixture are reduced to amino groups (-NH₂).\n        4.  **Step v:** This is the brilliant, yield-rescuing step. The mixture is nitrated a *second* time. For the major intermediates, the powerful activating amino group and the acetyl group now work **cooperatively** (reinforce each other) to direct the new nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This highly selective step **converges** the different pathways into a single, correctly substituted product stream.\n        5.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role in directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence represents a classic \"convergent synthesis.\" It cleverly overcomes the lack of selectivity in an early step by using a later, highly selective step to funnel the entire mixture toward the desired product. This makes the **overall synthesis**, from start to finish, a high-yield process. It is the only option where all steps are chemically valid and the strategy leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct synthetic pathway.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal**\n\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  `-COCH₃` (acetyl group) at C1\n    2.  `-Br` (bromo group) at C3\n    3.  `-NO₂` (nitro group) at C5\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution. All groups are *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Key Directing Effects:**\n    *   Acetyl (`-COCH₃`): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   Nitro (`-NO₂`): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   Bromo (`-Br`): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **Objective:** Find a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires the chosen reaction sequence to be highly selective and avoid steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Critical Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) has two critical limitations relevant here:\n    1.  It fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group.\n    2.  It fails on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) is a strong clue that an advanced strategy is being used. This strategy involves creating a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`) to act as a powerful director and then removing it at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **3. Systematically Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on its chemical viability and selectivity.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). After making p-bromonitrobenzene in the first two steps, the Friedel-Crafts acylation will not work because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This is not a viable route.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress toward the final product.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**\n    This pathway starts by converting benzene into aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation directly on aniline. As established in the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this sequence is fundamentally flawed as written.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a sophisticated but chemically sound synthesis.\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. These steps are selective and efficient.\n    2.  **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The directors are in conflict (acetyl is meta, bromo is ortho,para), which produces a *mixture* of isomers.\n    3.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the mixture of isomers is reduced to a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`).\n    4.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the key, elegant step. For the major intermediates in the mixture, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C5) with very high selectivity.\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having successfully directed the final substitution, is cleanly removed.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they contain either chemically impossible steps (Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring or on aniline) or a nonsensical reaction loop. Option D outlines a valid, albeit complex, \"convergent\" synthesis. It cleverly takes the mixture produced from a non-selective step and funnels all major products into the correctly substituted precursor in a subsequent, highly selective step. This is a hallmark of an elegant, high-yield synthetic design for a challenging target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** The molecule to be synthesized is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-arrangement. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This means the pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of unwanted isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nTo plan the synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other reaction rules.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Constraint (Friedel-Crafts Reaction):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group (`-NO₂`). It also fails when an amino group (`-NH₂`) is on the ring because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Provided in the Question**\n\nLet's evaluate each reaction sequence for chemical viability and its ability to achieve the high-yield goal.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then the meta-directing acetyl group correctly positions the bromine at C3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This is a sound start.\n    *   **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para), which will lead to a mixture of isomers. This appears to violate the high-yield principle.\n    *   **Steps iv-vii:** This is the elegant part of the synthesis. The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group. This amino group is a powerful director. In a subsequent nitration (step v), the powerful amino group and the acetyl group work cooperatively to direct the new nitro group to position 5 for all isomers in the mixture. This is a highly selective \"convergent\" step. Finally, the temporary amino group is removed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a sophisticated and valid convergent synthesis. It is designed to overcome an intermediate non-selective step, leading to a high overall yield. This is the correct approach.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product).\n    *   **Step iii:** An attempt is made to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene. This reaction will fail or give extremely low yields because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline.\n    *   **Step iii:** An attempt is made to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence converts benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop that does not advance the synthesis toward the target molecule.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically sound and elegant synthetic route. Although it involves an intermediate non-selective step (iii), it employs a well-known convergent synthesis strategy where a subsequent, highly selective step (v) resolves the mixture, thus achieving a high overall yield. This makes it the best and only correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** The molecule to be synthesized is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** It consists of a central benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**, which means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nTo design an effective synthesis, we must consider the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   The presence of both meta-directing and ortho,para-directing groups suggests a simple, direct substitution will be problematic.\n*   **Crucial Reaction Constraint (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is very sensitive. It fails on:\n    *   Strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a nitro group).\n    *   Aniline (a ring with an amino group, -NH₂), because the basic amine reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst and poisons it.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's systematically evaluate each proposed reaction sequence based on the principles above.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence first forms aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. Thus, this pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence first creates bromobenzene, then nitates it to give mainly p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or proceed with extremely low yield. This is not a high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress toward the target molecule.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\". Let's follow the steps:\n    1.  **Step i:** Acylation of benzene yields **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This step is regioselective.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. At this stage, the directors conflict (meta vs. ortho,para), so this step produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n    4.  **Step iv:** The entire mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to the corresponding amino isomers.\n    5.  **Step v:** A second nitration. This is the crucial, elegant step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful *ortho,para*-directing amino group and the *meta*-directing acetyl group **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This highly selective step causes the separate pathways to *converge* on the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having served its purpose of controlling the final substitution, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or futile steps. Option D is the only sequence that represents a valid, albeit complex, synthetic strategy. It cleverly uses a non-selective step and then funnels the resulting mixture into a single product pathway in a subsequent, highly selective step. This is a hallmark of an elegant, high-yield synthesis for a challenging target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal:**\n    *   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** The pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires the chosen reaction sequence to be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers that would be difficult to separate and lower the overall yield.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Directing Effects:** We must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles.\n        *   -COCH₃ (acetyl): Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n        *   -Br (bromo): Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n        *   -NO₂ (nitro): Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Reaction Constraints:** A critical rule governs one of the key reactions:\n        *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings** (e.g., those with a nitro group) and also fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst and poisons it.\n\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **Option A:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`\n        This sequence is nonsensical. The first four steps—nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination—take benzene as the starting material and convert it back into benzene. This is a pointless loop that makes no progress. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`\n        This sequence begins by converting benzene to aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this pathway is not viable as written.\n\n    *   **Option D:** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`\n        This sequence first produces bromobenzene and then nitratres it to form (mainly) p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give an extremely low yield. This pathway is also not viable.\n\n    *   **Option B:** `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n        This sequence represents a complex but chemically sound and elegant synthesis.\n        1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to **acetophenone**, introducing a *meta*-director.\n        2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This step is selective.\n        3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** Nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone is not selective because the directors conflict (-COCH₃ is *meta*, while -Br is *ortho,para*). This produces a mixture of isomers. This appears to be a low-yield step.\n        4.  **Steps iv-vii (The Convergent Strategy):** This is the brilliant part of the synthesis. The entire mixture from step iii is carried forward. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (a temporary, powerful directing group). A second nitration is performed. In this crucial step, the directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group work together (**converge**) to direct the new nitro group to the C5 position, regardless of which isomer from the mixture is used. Finally, the temporary amino group is removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    Options A, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed or non-viable chemical steps. Option B, while having one non-selective step, outlines a classic and powerful \"convergent synthesis\" strategy. This approach is specifically designed to overcome the problem of the initial mixture by funneling all major intermediates into the single desired product pathway, thereby achieving a high *overall* yield. It is the only complete, correct, and plausible strategy among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal:**\n    *   **Target:** The goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution. All groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**. This means the pathway must be designed to be highly regioselective, maximizing the formation of the desired product over isomers.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Directing Effects:** We must consider how each substituent directs incoming groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n        *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, but **ortho,para-director**.\n        *   `-NH₂` (Amino): Strongly activating, **ortho,para-director**. This group appears as a temporary intermediate.\n    *   **Key Constraint (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`), is crucial but has major limitations. It fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a nitro group) and on aniline (rings with an amino group, as the base poisons the catalyst).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Four Options:**\n\n    *   **Option A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n        *   This sequence generates bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n        *   **Flaw:** The Friedel-Crafts reaction in step (iii) will fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n    *   **Option B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   This sequence generates aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it.\n        *   **Flaw:** The Friedel-Crafts reaction in step (iii) will fail because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. While complex multi-step workarounds exist, the reaction as written is not standard or high-yield.\n\n    *   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂...**\n        *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction, diazotization, and then deamination.\n        *   **Flaw:** These first four steps simply take benzene and convert it back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress.\n\n    *   **Option C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   This sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound strategy.\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then the *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3 to form **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is efficient and selective.\n        2.  **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step is not highly selective due to conflicting directing effects (-COCH₃ is *meta*, -Br is *ortho,para*), producing a **mixture of isomers**.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The entire mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to the corresponding mixture of amino isomers. This creates a temporary, powerful directing group.\n        4.  **Step v:** The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. This is the brilliant, convergent step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful *ortho,para*-directing amino group and the *meta*-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This highly selective step funnels the product mixture toward the desired structure.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role, is removed via diazotization and deamination to give the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain either chemically non-viable steps or are nonsensical loops. Option C, while containing a non-selective intermediate step, describes an elegant and well-known \"convergent synthesis\" strategy. This approach is specifically designed to overcome the problem of the initial mixture by using a subsequent, highly selective step that forces all reaction pathways to converge on the desired product structure. This makes the overall process, from start to finish, a high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents on the Benzene Ring:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position C1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The pattern is 1,3,5. All three substituents are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The question asks for a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant quantities of unwanted isomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nTo design an effective synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other fundamental reaction limitations.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Reaction Limitation (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is crucial but is subject to strict rules. It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n*   **Advanced Strategy Indication:** The presence of `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) in the options strongly suggests the use of a sophisticated strategy involving an amino group (`-NH₂`) as a temporary, powerful directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical viability and the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. As established, this reaction fails because the basic amino group poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring. The presence of the nitro group prevents the acylation from occurring. Therefore, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n    This pathway is nonsensical. The first four steps (nitration -> reduction -> diazotization -> deamination) simply convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene. This is a futile loop that does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This pathway is complex but represents a chemically sound and elegant solution.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is a selective step.\n    3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This is a critical step in the strategy. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone is **not selective** because the directors are in conflict (`-COCH₃` directs meta to C5, while `-Br` directs ortho/para to C2, C4, C6). This produces a mixture of isomers. While this seems to violate the \"high-yield\" rule, it is part of a larger plan.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group. This introduces a powerful, temporary directing group.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step that redeems the synthesis. The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the new amino group and the original acetyl group **work together (converge)** to direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position: C5**. This step is highly selective and funnels the intermediates into a single product line.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its crucial role in directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a valid \"convergent synthesis\". Although it involves a non-selective intermediate step, the overall strategy is designed to resolve that mixture in a subsequent, highly selective step, leading to a high *overall* yield of the final product. This represents the most sophisticated and chemically correct pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the provided options to determine the correct, high-yield synthetic pathway.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Constraints\n\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (`-COCH₃`), a bromo group (`-Br`), and a nitro group (`-NO₂`) in a 1,3,5-relationship (all meta to each other).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\". This demands high selectivity (regioselectivity) in the reaction steps.\n*   **Reaction Limitation:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the acetyl group) is a critical step that fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a `-NO₂` group) and on aniline (rings with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   Steps i & ii convert benzene to aniline.\n    *   Step iii attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and \"poisons\" the `AlCl₃` catalyst, deactivating the ring. This pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a futile loop that accomplishes nothing. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   Steps i & ii produce 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene as the major product.\n    *   Step iii attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    This option describes a sophisticated but chemically sound multi-step synthesis.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This introduces a meta-directing acetyl group. This is a valid first step.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is a highly selective step.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** This is a key step. Nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone, which has conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, while `-Br` is ortho,para), produces a **mixture of isomers**. This initially appears to violate the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro groups on the entire mixture of isomers are reduced to amino groups. This introduces a powerful ortho,para-directing temporary group.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step that resolves the previous mixture. For the main intermediates, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the new nitro group to the same position (**C5**). This \"convergent\" step forces the reaction pathway towards the desired substitution pattern with high selectivity.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role in directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and C all contain fatally flawed steps that would fail or be nonsensical. Option D, while complex, outlines a valid and elegant synthetic strategy. It uses a \"convergent\" approach where an initial non-selective step is resolved by a subsequent highly selective step, a known and powerful technique for achieving a high *overall* yield in a complex synthesis. Therefore, it is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship with one another.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question demands a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This means the chosen sequence must be efficient and, most importantly, highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers which would lower the overall yield of the desired product.\n\n### **2. Review Key Chemical Principles**\n\n*   **Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-NH₂ (Amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**. Its presence in the reagents (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO₂/HCl`) suggests its use as a temporary directing group.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation Constraints:** This crucial reaction, used to add the acetyl group, **fails** under two specific conditions relevant here:\n    1.  On strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a nitro group).\n    2.  On aniline (rings with an amino group), as the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option for its chemical viability.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a futile loop that does not progress the synthesis.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Steps (i) and (ii) would produce p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or have an extremely low yield.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form aniline. However, step (iii) attempts a direct Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence describes a valid, sophisticated, and high-yield strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is a selective step.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step has conflicting directors (meta-directing acetyl vs. ortho,para-directing bromo) and produces a **mixture of isomers**. This initially appears to be a low-yield step.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group, creating a powerful temporary directing group.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the key, convergent step. In the main isomers from the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group now **reinforce** each other, both directing the new nitro group to the **C5 position**. This step is highly regioselective and funnels the previous mixture toward the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed to yield the final product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed steps (a futile loop or failed reactions). Option B describes a well-known, elegant strategy known as a **convergent synthesis**. While it contains an intermediate non-selective step, the overall design ensures a high yield by cleverly channeling the resulting mixture into a single product in a later, highly selective step. It is the only chemically viable and complete high-yield synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    *   The goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All groups are in a *meta* relationship to one another.\n\n2.  **Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n        *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n        *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **Crucial Reaction Limitation:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those with a nitro group. It also fails on rings with an amino group (-NH₂) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Sequentially:**\n\n    *   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   Steps (i) and (ii) would form 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene as the major product.\n        *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The reaction will fail or give extremely low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n        *   **Conclusion: Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline (-NH₂).\n        *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst by forming an unreactive complex.\n        *   **Conclusion: Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n        *   The first four steps of this sequence are nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence converts benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back into benzene. It is a futile loop that accomplishes nothing.\n        *   **Conclusion: Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   This sequence describes a sophisticated but valid and effective synthesis.\n        *   **i) Acylation:** Benzene → **Acetophenone**. OK.\n        *   **ii) Bromination:** The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, giving **3-bromoacetophenone**. This step is regioselective.\n        *   **iii) First Nitration:** 3-bromoacetophenone has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ directs meta, -Br directs ortho,para). This step produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n        *   **iv) Reduction:** The nitro group(s) on the mixture of isomers are reduced to amino (-NH₂) groups. This introduces a powerful ortho,para directing group.\n        *   **v) Second Nitration:** This is the key strategic step. For the isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group now work together (**converge**) to direct the new nitro group to the same place: **position 5**. This step is highly regioselective and funnels the mixture toward the correct product precursor.\n        *   **vi & vii) Diazotization & Deamination:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its critical role, is cleanly removed to yield the final product.\n        *   **Conclusion: Correct.** This strategy, known as a convergent synthesis, is designed to overcome the challenge of conflicting directors to provide a high overall yield.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option D outlines a complete and elegant synthetic pathway that, despite having a non-selective intermediate step, is designed as a whole to be a high-yield process. It is the only viable route among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Problem\n\n**1. Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This molecule has a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\nThe key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Directing Effects of Substituents:** The order of the reactions is crucial and depends on the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): A deactivating group but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Key Reaction Constraints:** A high-yield synthesis must consider the limitations of certain reactions:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts (FC) Acylation (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`):** This reaction is essential for adding the acetyl group, but it fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also fails on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with the `AlCl₃` catalyst, deactivating it.\n    *   **Temporary Directing Groups:** The inclusion of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of nitro to amino), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) strongly suggests an advanced strategy. This involves using an amino group (`-NH₂`) as a powerful temporary director to control the placement of other groups before it is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce p-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a **nonsensical loop** that makes no progress. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group poisons the `AlCl₃` catalyst. While multi-step workarounds exist, this direct reaction as written is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence describes a sophisticated but chemically sound **convergent synthesis**.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** This is a key strategic step. The ring has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para), so this reaction produces a **mixture of isomers**. This may seem like a low-yield step.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the mixture of isomers is reduced to a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`). No products are discarded.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group **cooperatively direct** the incoming nitro group to the same position (C5). This highly selective reaction \"funnels\" the mixture of intermediates from step (iii) towards the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its directing role, is cleanly removed to yield the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed or non-viable reaction steps as written. Option A is the only sequence that represents a complete and chemically sound pathway. It is a classic example of an elegant synthesis that, despite an intermediate non-selective step, is designed to be high-yield overall by cleverly using a temporary directing group and a convergent step to resolve the isomeric mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule and the Goal\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5 arrangement, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires the reaction sequence to be efficient and highly selective, avoiding steps that produce large amounts of unwanted isomers.\n\n### 2. Analyze Key Chemical Principles and Constraints\n*   **Substituent Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is critical.\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl)** and **-NO₂ (nitro)** are deactivating *meta*-directors.\n    *   **-Br (bromo)** is a deactivating *ortho,para*-director.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) has major limitations. It fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group) and on rings with a basic amino group (-NH₂), which poisons the catalyst.\n*   **Temporary Directing Group:** The inclusion of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (forms a diazonium salt), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the diazonium salt) is a strong clue that the best strategy involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful temporary director. This group can be used to control the placement of other substituents and is then removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nLet's analyze each of the provided reaction sequences based on these principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence first creates aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation directly on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence generates p-bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii). The reaction will fail or give extremely low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** This describes a sophisticated but sound \"convergent synthesis.\"\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then to 3-bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group ensures the bromine is placed correctly.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not selective because the directing effects of the -COCH₃ (meta) and -Br (ortho,para) groups are in conflict, leading to a mixture of isomers.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to the corresponding amino isomers.\n        4.  **Step v:** A second nitration is performed. This is the crucial, elegant step. For the main isomers in the mixture, the powerful *ortho,para*-directing amino group and the *meta*-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**, both directing the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is a highly selective step that funnels the mixture toward the correct product.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role, is removed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a well-designed, high-yield strategy that uses a convergent approach to resolve the lack of selectivity in an intermediate step. It is the most chemically sound pathway.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop and is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on the analysis, Options A, B, and D contain fundamentally flawed or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a valid, albeit complex, synthetic route that is designed to be high-yield overall by cleverly using a temporary directing group in a convergent synthesis. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting with benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Goal\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be highly efficient and regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints\n*   **Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is dictated by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Critical Constraints on Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) has two critical limitations relevant here:\n    1.  It fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group.\n    2.  It fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    This sequence is incorrect. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop and does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) on p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product from the first two steps). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing the FCA reaction to fail or proceed with extremely low yield.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). As stated in the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. Although the subsequent steps are designed around reinforcing directing effects, the failure of step (iii) makes the entire pathway non-viable as written.\n\n*   **Option C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to C3, efficiently forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not highly selective because the directors are in conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, while -Br is ortho,para), leading to a **mixture of isomers**.\n    3.  **Step iv:** The entire mixture of nitro-isomers is then reduced, converting the nitro groups into amino (-NH₂) groups. This introduces a powerful temporary directing group.\n    4.  **Step v:** This is the elegant, yield-rescuing step. The mixture of amino-isomers is nitrated again. For the major isomers in the mixture, the directing effects of the powerful amino group (ortho,para) and the acetyl group (meta) now **cooperate (reinforce each other)**. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, **C5**. This highly selective step causes the different pathways to converge, funneling the intermediates into the correctly substituted product.\n    5.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain either nonsensical steps or reactions that fail under the specified conditions. Option C, while involving a non-selective intermediate step, describes a classic and powerful synthetic strategy. By cleverly using a convergent step to resolve the isomeric mixture, it achieves a high overall yield from start to finish using only viable reactions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Evaluate the Chemical Viability of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze each of the four distinct synthetic pathways presented.\n\n*   **Sequence in Option A:** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`\n    *   This pathway involves performing a Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) on a bromonitrobenzene ring.\n    *   **Flaw:** The nitro group (`-NO₂`) is a strong deactivating group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction from occurring. This is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n*   **Sequence in Option B:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`\n    *   This pathway creates aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it.\n    *   **Flaw:** This reaction fails under standard conditions. The basic amino group (`-NH₂`) of aniline acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`), poisoning the catalyst and deactivating the ring. As written, this is not a valid synthetic step.\n\n*   **Sequence in Option D:** This option, as presented by some agents, involves `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`.\n    *   **Flaw:** This sequence takes benzene, converts it to nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. It is a pointless loop that makes no progress.\n\n*   **Sequence in Option C:** `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n    This sequence represents a sophisticated, multi-step synthesis.\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation to make acetophenone, followed by bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is an efficient start.\n    2.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This step involves nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone. The directors conflict (acetyl is meta, bromo is ortho,para), leading to a **mixture of isomers**. This initially appears to be a low-yield step.\n    3.  **Step iv & v (Convergent Steps):** This is the brilliant part of the strategy. The mixture of nitro-isomers is reduced to the corresponding amino-isomers (step iv). Then, a second nitration is performed (step v). For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group (`-NH₂`) and the acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) **work together cooperatively**. They force the new nitro group to add to the same position (C5). This highly selective step **converges** the different pathways, funneling the mixture from step iii toward the correct intermediate.\n    4.  **Step vi & vii (Cleanup):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its critical role in directing the final substitution, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Options A and B contain reactions that fail under the specified conditions.\n*   Option D (as defined in the detailed breakdown) is a nonsensical loop.\n*   Option C describes a valid, albeit complex, \"convergent synthesis.\" This is a known and powerful strategy for creating complex molecules where simpler pathways are blocked. It overcomes the non-selective step (iii) by using a subsequent, highly selective step (v) to resolve the mixture, thus leading to a high *overall* yield of the final product.\n\nTherefore, the sequence presented in option C is the only chemically sound, high-yield route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** The product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are arranged in a 1,3,5-pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** The question demands a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant amounts of unwanted isomers or that fail to proceed.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction (using `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` to add the acetyl group) is crucial but has major limitations. It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also **fails** on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The inclusion of `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (forms a diazonium salt), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the diazonium salt) is a strong clue that an advanced strategy involving a temporary amino group is necessary to control the placement of the substituents.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Methodically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence first makes bromobenzene, then nitrates it to form p-bromonitrobenzene (the major isomer). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence is a pointless loop. Steps (i) through (iv) take benzene, nitrate it, reduce the nitro group to an amine, form a diazonium salt, and then remove it to regenerate the starting material, benzene. This sequence makes no progress towards the product.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating it and the ring. Although the rest of the proposed synthesis would be highly selective, this non-viable first key step makes the entire pathway incorrect as written.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence describes a sophisticated but chemically sound strategy known as a \"convergent synthesis\".\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, then brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group ensures that 3-bromoacetophenone is formed with high selectivity.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not selective because the directing effects of the acetyl group (meta) and the bromo group (ortho,para) are in conflict, leading to a mixture of isomers.\n    3.  **Step iv & v:** This is the brilliant part of the strategy. The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group, which is a powerful temporary director. Then, a second nitration is performed. In this step, the powerful amino group and the acetyl group work cooperatively to direct the new nitro group to position 5 with very high selectivity, regardless of which isomer from the previous mixture is used. This causes the different reaction pathways to **converge** on the correct substitution pattern.\n    4.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having perfectly served its directing role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain steps that are either chemically non-viable under the specified conditions or are nonsensical. Option A describes a well-established, elegant synthetic route that, despite containing one non-selective step, is designed to funnel the resulting mixture toward a single product in a subsequent, highly selective step. This \"convergent\" approach allows for a high overall yield from the starting material and represents the best and only correct answer among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting with benzene.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** The product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at C1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5 arrangement, where all three groups are *meta* to one another.\n*   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**, meaning it must be designed for high selectivity, avoiding steps that produce large amounts of difficult-to-separate isomers.\n\n### **2. Key Chemical Principles and Constraints**\n\n*   **Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitations:** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group, has two critical constraints relevant here:\n    1.  It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as one bearing a nitro group (-NO₂).\n    2.  It **fails** on aniline (a ring with an amino group, -NH₂), because the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n*   **Advanced Strategy:** The inclusion of `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization of -NH₂), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) strongly suggests that a sophisticated strategy is required. This involves using an amino group as a powerful, temporary directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the principles above.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence first creates bromobenzene, then nitratates it (mostly to p-bromonitrobenzene). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence first prepares aniline (benzene → nitrobenzene → aniline). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation directly on aniline.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. Although more complex procedures exist to achieve this transformation, the sequence as written is fundamentally flawed. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop and does not advance the synthesis. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence represents a complex but sound and elegant synthetic strategy.\n        1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first converted to acetophenone, and then brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is efficient and selective.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is **not selective** because of conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is *meta*, -Br is *ortho,para*), so it produces a mixture of isomers. This appears to violate the \"high-yield\" rule.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The nitro groups on the entire mixture are reduced to amino groups (-NH₂).\n        4.  **Step v:** This is the brilliant, yield-rescuing step. The mixture is nitrated a *second* time. For the major intermediates, the powerful activating amino group and the acetyl group now work **cooperatively** (reinforce each other) to direct the new nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This highly selective step **converges** the different pathways into a single, correctly substituted product stream.\n        5.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role in directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence represents a classic \"convergent synthesis.\" It cleverly overcomes the lack of selectivity in an early step by using a later, highly selective step to funnel the entire mixture toward the desired product. This makes the **overall synthesis**, from start to finish, a high-yield process. It is the only option where all steps are chemically valid and the strategy leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the correct synthetic pathway.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal**\n\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  `-COCH₃` (acetyl group) at C1\n    2.  `-Br` (bromo group) at C3\n    3.  `-NO₂` (nitro group) at C5\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution. All groups are *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Key Directing Effects:**\n    *   Acetyl (`-COCH₃`): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   Nitro (`-NO₂`): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   Bromo (`-Br`): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n*   **Objective:** Find a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires the chosen reaction sequence to be highly selective and avoid steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Critical Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) has two critical limitations relevant here:\n    1.  It fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group.\n    2.  It fails on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Use of a Temporary Directing Group:** The presence of reagents for reduction (`Fe/HCl`), diazotization (`NaNO₂/HCl`), and deamination (`H₃PO₂`) is a strong clue that an advanced strategy is being used. This strategy involves creating a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`) to act as a powerful director and then removing it at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **3. Systematically Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on its chemical viability and selectivity.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). After making p-bromonitrobenzene in the first two steps, the Friedel-Crafts acylation will not work because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This is not a viable route.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress toward the final product.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**\n    This pathway starts by converting benzene into aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation directly on aniline. As established in the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this sequence is fundamentally flawed as written.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a sophisticated but chemically sound synthesis.\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. These steps are selective and efficient.\n    2.  **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The directors are in conflict (acetyl is meta, bromo is ortho,para), which produces a *mixture* of isomers.\n    3.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the mixture of isomers is reduced to a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`).\n    4.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the key, elegant step. For the major intermediates in the mixture, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C5) with very high selectivity.\n    5.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having successfully directed the final substitution, is cleanly removed.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they contain either chemically impossible steps (Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring or on aniline) or a nonsensical reaction loop. Option D outlines a valid, albeit complex, \"convergent\" synthesis. It cleverly takes the mixture produced from a non-selective step and funnels all major products into the correctly substituted precursor in a subsequent, highly selective step. This is a hallmark of an elegant, high-yield synthetic design for a challenging target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target:** The molecule to be synthesized is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-arrangement. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This means the pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of unwanted isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nTo plan the synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other reaction rules.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Constraint (Friedel-Crafts Reaction):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group (`-NO₂`). It also fails when an amino group (`-NH₂`) is on the ring because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Provided in the Question**\n\nLet's evaluate each reaction sequence for chemical viability and its ability to achieve the high-yield goal.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then the meta-directing acetyl group correctly positions the bromine at C3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This is a sound start.\n    *   **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para), which will lead to a mixture of isomers. This appears to violate the high-yield principle.\n    *   **Steps iv-vii:** This is the elegant part of the synthesis. The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group. This amino group is a powerful director. In a subsequent nitration (step v), the powerful amino group and the acetyl group work cooperatively to direct the new nitro group to position 5 for all isomers in the mixture. This is a highly selective \"convergent\" step. Finally, the temporary amino group is removed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a sophisticated and valid convergent synthesis. It is designed to overcome an intermediate non-selective step, leading to a high overall yield. This is the correct approach.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product).\n    *   **Step iii:** An attempt is made to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene. This reaction will fail or give extremely low yields because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to aniline.\n    *   **Step iii:** An attempt is made to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence converts benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop that does not advance the synthesis toward the target molecule.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed or nonsensical steps. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically sound and elegant synthetic route. Although it involves an intermediate non-selective step (iii), it employs a well-known convergent synthesis strategy where a subsequent, highly selective step (v) resolves the mixture, thus achieving a high overall yield. This makes it the best and only correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** The molecule to be synthesized is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** It consists of a central benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**, which means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nTo design an effective synthesis, we must consider the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   The presence of both meta-directing and ortho,para-directing groups suggests a simple, direct substitution will be problematic.\n*   **Crucial Reaction Constraint (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is very sensitive. It fails on:\n    *   Strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a nitro group).\n    *   Aniline (a ring with an amino group, -NH₂), because the basic amine reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst and poisons it.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's systematically evaluate each proposed reaction sequence based on the principles above.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence first forms aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. Thus, this pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence first creates bromobenzene, then nitates it to give mainly p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or proceed with extremely low yield. This is not a high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress toward the target molecule.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\". Let's follow the steps:\n    1.  **Step i:** Acylation of benzene yields **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This step is regioselective.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. At this stage, the directors conflict (meta vs. ortho,para), so this step produces a **mixture of isomers**.\n    4.  **Step iv:** The entire mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to the corresponding amino isomers.\n    5.  **Step v:** A second nitration. This is the crucial, elegant step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful *ortho,para*-directing amino group and the *meta*-directing acetyl group **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This highly selective step causes the separate pathways to *converge* on the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having served its purpose of controlling the final substitution, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or futile steps. Option D is the only sequence that represents a valid, albeit complex, synthetic strategy. It cleverly uses a non-selective step and then funnels the resulting mixture into a single product pathway in a subsequent, highly selective step. This is a hallmark of an elegant, high-yield synthesis for a challenging target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal:**\n    *   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** The pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires the chosen reaction sequence to be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding the formation of significant amounts of unwanted isomers that would be difficult to separate and lower the overall yield.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Directing Effects:** We must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles.\n        *   -COCH₃ (acetyl): Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n        *   -Br (bromo): Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n        *   -NO₂ (nitro): Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Reaction Constraints:** A critical rule governs one of the key reactions:\n        *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) fails on strongly deactivated rings** (e.g., those with a nitro group) and also fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst and poisons it.\n\n3.  **Systematically Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **Option A:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`\n        This sequence is nonsensical. The first four steps—nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination—take benzene as the starting material and convert it back into benzene. This is a pointless loop that makes no progress. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`\n        This sequence begins by converting benzene to aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this pathway is not viable as written.\n\n    *   **Option D:** `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`\n        This sequence first produces bromobenzene and then nitratres it to form (mainly) p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or give an extremely low yield. This pathway is also not viable.\n\n    *   **Option B:** `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`\n        This sequence represents a complex but chemically sound and elegant synthesis.\n        1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to **acetophenone**, introducing a *meta*-director.\n        2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This step is selective.\n        3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** Nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone is not selective because the directors conflict (-COCH₃ is *meta*, while -Br is *ortho,para*). This produces a mixture of isomers. This appears to be a low-yield step.\n        4.  **Steps iv-vii (The Convergent Strategy):** This is the brilliant part of the synthesis. The entire mixture from step iii is carried forward. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (a temporary, powerful directing group). A second nitration is performed. In this crucial step, the directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group work together (**converge**) to direct the new nitro group to the C5 position, regardless of which isomer from the mixture is used. Finally, the temporary amino group is removed via diazotization and deamination.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    Options A, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed or non-viable chemical steps. Option B, while having one non-selective step, outlines a classic and powerful \"convergent synthesis\" strategy. This approach is specifically designed to overcome the problem of the initial mixture by funneling all major intermediates into the single desired product pathway, thereby achieving a high *overall* yield. It is the only complete, correct, and plausible strategy among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal:**\n    *   **Target:** The goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution. All groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   **Requirement:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield\"**. This means the pathway must be designed to be highly regioselective, maximizing the formation of the desired product over isomers.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Directing Effects:** We must consider how each substituent directs incoming groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n        *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n        *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, but **ortho,para-director**.\n        *   `-NH₂` (Amino): Strongly activating, **ortho,para-director**. This group appears as a temporary intermediate.\n    *   **Key Constraint (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction, used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`), is crucial but has major limitations. It fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a nitro group) and on aniline (rings with an amino group, as the base poisons the catalyst).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Four Options:**\n\n    *   **Option A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n        *   This sequence generates bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n        *   **Flaw:** The Friedel-Crafts reaction in step (iii) will fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n    *   **Option B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n        *   This sequence generates aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on it.\n        *   **Flaw:** The Friedel-Crafts reaction in step (iii) will fail because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst. While complex multi-step workarounds exist, the reaction as written is not standard or high-yield.\n\n    *   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂...**\n        *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction, diazotization, and then deamination.\n        *   **Flaw:** These first four steps simply take benzene and convert it back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop that makes no progress.\n\n    *   **Option C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n        *   This sequence represents a sophisticated and chemically sound strategy.\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then the *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3 to form **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is efficient and selective.\n        2.  **Step iii:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step is not highly selective due to conflicting directing effects (-COCH₃ is *meta*, -Br is *ortho,para*), producing a **mixture of isomers**.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The entire mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to the corresponding mixture of amino isomers. This creates a temporary, powerful directing group.\n        4.  **Step v:** The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. This is the brilliant, convergent step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful *ortho,para*-directing amino group and the *meta*-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position (C5)**. This highly selective step funnels the product mixture toward the desired structure.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role, is removed via diazotization and deamination to give the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain either chemically non-viable steps or are nonsensical loops. Option C, while containing a non-selective intermediate step, describes an elegant and well-known \"convergent synthesis\" strategy. This approach is specifically designed to overcome the problem of the initial mixture by using a subsequent, highly selective step that forces all reaction pathways to converge on the desired product structure. This makes the overall process, from start to finish, a high-yield synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Substituents on the Benzene Ring:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position C1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position C3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The pattern is 1,3,5. All three substituents are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n*   **Requirement:** The question asks for a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant quantities of unwanted isomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints**\n\nTo design an effective synthesis, we must consider the directing effects of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and other fundamental reaction limitations.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Reaction Limitation (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The reaction to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is crucial but is subject to strict rules. It **fails** on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also **fails** on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with and poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl₃`).\n*   **Advanced Strategy Indication:** The presence of `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) in the options strongly suggests the use of a sophisticated strategy involving an amino group (`-NH₂`) as a temporary, powerful directing group that is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical viability and the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. As established, this reaction fails because the basic amino group poisons the AlCl₃ catalyst. Therefore, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This pathway fails at step (iii). It first prepares 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product). Then, it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this highly deactivated ring. The presence of the nitro group prevents the acylation from occurring. Therefore, this is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n    This pathway is nonsensical. The first four steps (nitration -> reduction -> diazotization -> deamination) simply convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene. This is a futile loop that does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This pathway is complex but represents a chemically sound and elegant solution.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is a selective step.\n    3.  **Step iii (First Nitration):** This is a critical step in the strategy. The nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone is **not selective** because the directors are in conflict (`-COCH₃` directs meta to C5, while `-Br` directs ortho/para to C2, C4, C6). This produces a mixture of isomers. While this seems to violate the \"high-yield\" rule, it is part of a larger plan.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino (`-NH₂`) group. This introduces a powerful, temporary directing group.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step that redeems the synthesis. The mixture of amino isomers is nitrated again. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the new amino group and the original acetyl group **work together (converge)** to direct the incoming nitro group to the **same position: C5**. This step is highly selective and funnels the intermediates into a single product line.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its crucial role in directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a valid \"convergent synthesis\". Although it involves a non-selective intermediate step, the overall strategy is designed to resolve that mixture in a subsequent, highly selective step, leading to a high *overall* yield of the final product. This represents the most sophisticated and chemically correct pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the provided options to determine the correct, high-yield synthetic pathway.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Constraints\n\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (`-COCH₃`), a bromo group (`-Br`), and a nitro group (`-NO₂`) in a 1,3,5-relationship (all meta to each other).\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Key Constraint:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\". This demands high selectivity (regioselectivity) in the reaction steps.\n*   **Reaction Limitation:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the acetyl group) is a critical step that fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a `-NO₂` group) and on aniline (rings with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   Steps i & ii convert benzene to aniline.\n    *   Step iii attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with and \"poisons\" the `AlCl₃` catalyst, deactivating the ring. This pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...`**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a futile loop that accomplishes nothing. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...`**\n    *   Steps i & ii produce 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene as the major product.\n    *   Step iii attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂`**\n    This option describes a sophisticated but chemically sound multi-step synthesis.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This introduces a meta-directing acetyl group. This is a valid first step.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is a highly selective step.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** This is a key step. Nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone, which has conflicting directors (`-COCH₃` is meta, while `-Br` is ortho,para), produces a **mixture of isomers**. This initially appears to violate the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro groups on the entire mixture of isomers are reduced to amino groups. This introduces a powerful ortho,para-directing temporary group.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step that resolves the previous mixture. For the main intermediates, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**. They both direct the new nitro group to the same position (**C5**). This \"convergent\" step forces the reaction pathway towards the desired substitution pattern with high selectivity.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role in directing the final nitro group, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and C all contain fatally flawed steps that would fail or be nonsensical. Option D, while complex, outlines a valid and elegant synthetic strategy. It uses a \"convergent\" approach where an initial non-selective step is resolved by a subsequent highly selective step, a known and powerful technique for achieving a high *overall* yield in a complex synthesis. Therefore, it is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1.

An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship with one another.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question demands a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This means the chosen sequence must be efficient and, most importantly, highly regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers which would lower the overall yield of the desired product.\n\n### **2. Review Key Chemical Principles**\n\n*   **Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-NH₂ (Amino):** Strongly activating and an **ortho,para-director**. Its presence in the reagents (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO₂/HCl`) suggests its use as a temporary directing group.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation Constraints:** This crucial reaction, used to add the acetyl group, **fails** under two specific conditions relevant here:\n    1.  On strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a nitro group).\n    2.  On aniline (rings with an amino group), as the basic amine poisons the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's evaluate each option for its chemical viability.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a futile loop that does not progress the synthesis.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Steps (i) and (ii) would produce p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. Because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, this reaction will fail or have an extremely low yield.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form aniline. However, step (iii) attempts a direct Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with and deactivates the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence describes a valid, sophisticated, and high-yield strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, yielding **3-bromoacetophenone**. This is a selective step.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. This step has conflicting directors (meta-directing acetyl vs. ortho,para-directing bromo) and produces a **mixture of isomers**. This initially appears to be a low-yield step.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the isomer mixture is reduced to an amino group, creating a powerful temporary directing group.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the key, convergent step. In the main isomers from the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group now **reinforce** each other, both directing the new nitro group to the **C5 position**. This step is highly regioselective and funnels the previous mixture toward the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its strategic role, is cleanly removed to yield the final product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed steps (a futile loop or failed reactions). Option B describes a well-known, elegant strategy known as a **convergent synthesis**. While it contains an intermediate non-selective step, the overall design ensures a high yield by cleverly channeling the resulting mixture into a single product in a later, highly selective step. It is the only chemically viable and complete high-yield synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    *   The goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n        1.

This introduces a powerful ortho,para directing group.\n        *   **v) Second Nitration:** This is the key strategic step. For the isomers in the mixture, the powerful directing effects of the temporary amino group and the acetyl group now work together (**converge**) to direct the new nitro group to the same place: **position 5**. This step is highly regioselective and funnels the mixture toward the correct product precursor.\n        *   **vi & vii) Diazotization & Deamination:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its critical role, is cleanly removed to yield the final product.\n        *   **Conclusion: Correct.** This strategy, known as a convergent synthesis, is designed to overcome the challenge of conflicting directors to provide a high overall yield.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or nonsensical steps. Option D outlines a complete and elegant synthetic pathway that, despite having a non-selective intermediate step, is designed as a whole to be a high-yield process. It is the only viable route among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Problem\n\n**1. Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This molecule has a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (`-COCH₃`) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (`-Br`) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 5.\nThe key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Directing Effects of Substituents:** The order of the reactions is crucial and depends on the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n    *   `-COCH₃` (Acetyl): A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   `-Br` (Bromo): A deactivating group but an **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   `-NO₂` (Nitro): A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Key Reaction Constraints:** A high-yield synthesis must consider the limitations of certain reactions:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts (FC) Acylation (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`):** This reaction is essential for adding the acetyl group, but it fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group. It also fails on aniline (a ring with an `-NH₂` group) because the basic amine reacts with the `AlCl₃` catalyst, deactivating it.\n    *   **Temporary Directing Groups:** The inclusion of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduction of nitro to amino), `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization), and `H₃PO₂` (deamination) strongly suggests an advanced strategy. This involves using an amino group (`-NH₂`) as a powerful temporary director to control the placement of other groups before it is removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce p-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is not a viable pathway.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) take the starting material, benzene, and convert it back into benzene. This is a **nonsensical loop** that makes no progress. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group poisons the `AlCl₃` catalyst. While multi-step workarounds exist, this direct reaction as written is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence describes a sophisticated but chemically sound **convergent synthesis**.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This adds a meta-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** This is a key strategic step. The ring has conflicting directors (-COCH₃ is meta, -Br is ortho,para), so this reaction produces a **mixture of isomers**. This may seem like a low-yield step.\n    4.  **Step iv (Reduction):** The nitro group on the mixture of isomers is reduced to a temporary amino group (`-NH₂`). No products are discarded.\n    5.  **Step v (Second Nitration):** This is the brilliant, regioselective step. For the major isomers in the mixture, the powerful ortho,para-directing amino group and the meta-directing acetyl group **cooperatively direct** the incoming nitro group to the same position (C5). This highly selective reaction \"funnels\" the mixture of intermediates from step (iii) towards the correct substitution pattern.\n    6.  **Steps vi & vii (Deamination):** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its directing role, is cleanly removed to yield the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed or non-viable reaction steps as written. Option A is the only sequence that represents a complete and chemically sound pathway. It is a classic example of an elegant synthesis that, despite an intermediate non-selective step, is designed to be high-yield overall by cleverly using a temporary directing group and a convergent step to resolve the isomeric mixture.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule and the Goal\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5 arrangement, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Goal:** A \"high-yield\" synthesis. This requires the reaction sequence to be efficient and highly selective, avoiding steps that produce large amounts of unwanted isomers.\n\n### 2. Analyze Key Chemical Principles and Constraints\n*   **Substituent Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is critical.\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl)** and **-NO₂ (nitro)** are deactivating *meta*-directors.\n    *   **-Br (bromo)** is a deactivating *ortho,para*-director.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The reaction to add the acetyl group (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) has major limitations. It fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group) and on rings with a basic amino group (-NH₂), which poisons the catalyst.\n*   **Temporary Directing Group:** The inclusion of reagents like `Fe/HCl` (reduces -NO₂ to -NH₂), `NaNO₂/HCl` (forms a diazonium salt), and `H₃PO₂` (removes the diazonium salt) is a strong clue that the best strategy involves using an amino group (-NH₂) as a powerful temporary director. This group can be used to control the placement of other substituents and is then removed at the end of the synthesis.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nLet's analyze each of the provided reaction sequences based on these principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence first creates aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation directly on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable as written.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence generates p-bromonitrobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii). The reaction will fail or give extremely low yield because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    *   **Analysis:** This describes a sophisticated but sound \"convergent synthesis.\"\n        1.  **Steps i & ii:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone, and then to 3-bromoacetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group ensures the bromine is placed correctly.\n        2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not selective because the directing effects of the -COCH₃ (meta) and -Br (ortho,para) groups are in conflict, leading to a mixture of isomers.\n        3.  **Step iv:** The mixture of nitro isomers is reduced to the corresponding amino isomers.\n        4.  **Step v:** A second nitration is performed. This is the crucial, elegant step. For the main isomers in the mixture, the powerful *ortho,para*-directing amino group and the *meta*-directing acetyl group now **work together cooperatively**, both directing the incoming nitro group to position 5. This is a highly selective step that funnels the mixture toward the correct product.\n        5.  **Steps vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role, is removed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a well-designed, high-yield strategy that uses a convergent approach to resolve the lack of selectivity in an intermediate step. It is the most chemically sound pathway.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   **Analysis:** The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert the starting material, benzene, back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop and is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on the analysis, Options A, B, and D contain fundamentally flawed or nonsensical steps. Option C describes a valid, albeit complex, synthetic route that is designed to be high-yield overall by cleverly using a temporary directing group in a convergent synthesis. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting with benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Goal\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n*   **Key Requirement:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means the chosen pathway must be highly efficient and regioselective, avoiding steps that produce significant mixtures of isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects and Key Reaction Constraints\n*   **Directing Effects:** The order of reactions is dictated by the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating, **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating, **ortho,para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **Critical Constraints on Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** The reaction used to add the acetyl group (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) has two critical limitations relevant here:\n    1.  It fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as those with a nitro group.\n    2.  It fails on aniline (a ring with an -NH₂ group) because the basic amine \"poisons\" the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    This sequence is incorrect. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene back into benzene. This is a nonsensical loop and does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is incorrect. It attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) on p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product from the first two steps). The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, causing the FCA reaction to fail or proceed with extremely low yield.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). As stated in the constraints, this reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. Although the subsequent steps are designed around reinforcing directing effects, the failure of step (iii) makes the entire pathway non-viable as written.\n\n*   **Option C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n    This option describes a sophisticated and chemically sound \"convergent synthesis\".\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Benzene is first acylated to acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group then correctly directs bromination to C3, efficiently forming **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n    2.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is not highly selective because the directors are in conflict (-COCH₃ is meta, while -Br is ortho,para), leading to a **mixture of isomers**.\n    3.  **Step iv:** The entire mixture of nitro-isomers is then reduced, converting the nitro groups into amino (-NH₂) groups. This introduces a powerful temporary directing group.\n    4.  **Step v:** This is the elegant, yield-rescuing step. The mixture of amino-isomers is nitrated again. For the major isomers in the mixture, the directing effects of the powerful amino group (ortho,para) and the acetyl group (meta) now **cooperate (reinforce each other)**. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, **C5**. This highly selective step causes the different pathways to converge, funneling the intermediates into the correctly substituted product.\n    5.  **Step vi & vii:** The temporary amino group, having fulfilled its role, is cleanly removed via diazotization and deamination to yield the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain either nonsensical steps or reactions that fail under the specified conditions. Option C, while involving a non-selective intermediate step, describes a classic and powerful synthetic strategy. By cleverly using a convergent step to resolve the isomeric mixture, it achieves a high overall yield from start to finish using only viable reactions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
