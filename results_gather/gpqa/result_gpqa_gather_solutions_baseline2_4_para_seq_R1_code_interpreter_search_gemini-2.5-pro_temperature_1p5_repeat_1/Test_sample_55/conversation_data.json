Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to the ground state.\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 3s orbital.\n*   **Final State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two sequential **electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This means the atom must pass through an intermediate state in a cascade decay:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nThis process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous decay (emission of a photon), the atom's energy must decrease. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom model, this means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease in each step.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is **forbidden** because the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions:\n*   **Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since energy must decrease, $n' < 3$.\n*   **Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   A transition from a state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ is allowed, as $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n    *   Since energy must decrease, $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), we find the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, the intermediate state must be one of the three 2p sublevels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes presented in the options are physically valid paths according to the selection rules.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Transition Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific path is the branching ratio, which is the product of the probabilities of each step in the cascade.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$ for a specific $m'$.**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s`-state ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because the initial state and the E1 interaction are isotropic (in the absence of external fields), the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single one* of these states is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate `2p` state (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$), the only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy is the `1s` ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. As this is the only available pathway, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe correct answer must list a valid transition route and the correct probability of 1/3.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n    *   The route has a typo, and the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only choice that correctly pairs a valid physical process with its correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Physical Principles\n\nThe problem asks for a valid decay pathway and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The process is specified as two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number:** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay (spontaneous emission), energy is released, so the principal quantum number `n` must decrease in each step.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, violating the selection rules. Therefore, a two-step process via an intermediate state, let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, is required.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since this is a decay, the energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   A transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ is allowed, as $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n    *   Since this is also a decay, the energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$ and $l'=1$. The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all transition routes presented in the options (A, B, C, D) are physically plausible pathways.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability (or branching ratio). The overall probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n$P_{\\text{route}} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of the first step, $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**:\n    *   **Careful Point:** The most critical insight, unanimously agreed upon by all the candidate answers, is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s`-state ($l=0$). This state is **spherically symmetric**.\n    *   In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space for the emitted photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes that make up all the possibilities for this transition, the probability of decaying into any **single specific** channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step, $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**:\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.\n    *   Because this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any one of the three complete cascade routes is:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = (\\frac{1}{3}) \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, any of the valid decay routes has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the specific options given in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nThe only option that combines a physically valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a comprehensive synthesis of the candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous agreement on the underlying physics. The solution can be broken down into the following step-by-step analysis, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, to the ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$, through two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay via an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** A direct, single-step transition is forbidden. This is because the electric dipole selection rules, which govern these transitions, are not met. For a transition, the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. A direct $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ transition would have $\\Delta l = 0$, making it forbidden. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n1.  **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so `n` must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state (with $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease in this step as well, so $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Combining the energy constraints from both steps gives $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. This means the intermediate state must be one of the 2p states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition *routes* shown in the options are, therefore, physically plausible. The decision must hinge on the associated probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route\nThe total probability for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path, the transition happens with certainty. Thus, the probability for this second step is $P_2 = 1$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$):** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific sublevel, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    **Careful Point 3 (The crucial concept):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. `s-states` are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly describes a possible physical process with its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous agreement on the physical principles and the final calculated result. The variations in the final letter choices of the candidates are due to the randomization of the option order they were presented with. Here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules:**\n    *   The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it must pass through an intermediate state.\n    *   The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n        *   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   The change in magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For decay, energy must be released, so the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease in each step.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$.

This transition is allowed as $\\Delta l=-1$. For energy to decrease, the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Combining the energy constraints ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Combined with $l'=1$, the intermediate state must be one of the three `2p` sub-levels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All paths shown in the options are, therefore, physically possible routes.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    The probability, or branching ratio, of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.

The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\nThis process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n3.  For spontaneous emission (decay), the energy of the atom must decrease. In the non-relativistic H-atom, this means the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease** at each step.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Path of the Two-Step Decay\nThe decay must proceed through an intermediate state: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's call the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have **$l' = 1$**.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so **$n' < 3$**.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have **$m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$**.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   This transition must go from $l'=1$ to the final state's $l=0$, giving $\\Delta l = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so **$n' > 1$**.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have **$n'=2$**. Therefore, the decay proceeds through the $n=2, l=1$ (2p) level. The three possible pathways involve the intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes shown in the options are physically valid paths.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability of a single, specific decay path is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each individual step.\n$P(\\text{total route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    This is the most critical calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, making it an **s-state**. A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. In the absence of external fields, this means there is no preferred direction in space for the spontaneous emission. The decay is isotropic. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability of decaying into any **single one** of these specific states is exactly **$\\frac{1}{3}$**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    Once the atom is in a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, the only possible E1 decay path to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.

Understand the Physical Process and Identify Governing Rules**\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, to the ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.

The parity of the state must change.\n*   **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so $n$ must decrease at each step ($n_{\\text{final}} < n_{\\text{initial}}$).\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State and Possible Routes**\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because the change in the orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0$, violating the selection rule.

The steps and careful points below synthesize this consensus to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state `|3,0,0⟩` to the final state `|1,0,0⟩`. The mechanism is specified as **two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions**, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **Δl = ±1**.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **Δm = 0, ±1**.\n3.  For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, meaning the principal quantum number **n must decrease** at each step.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A direct one-step transition from `|3,0,0⟩` to `|1,0,0⟩` is forbidden. For such a transition, Δl = 0 - 0 = 0, which violates the Δl = ±1 rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be denoted by `|n',l',m'⟩`. We can find its properties by applying the selection rules to both steps of the cascade:\n\n*   **First Transition: `|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩`**\n    *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n    *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have **m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}**.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so **n' < 3**.\n\n*   **Second Transition: `|n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`**\n    *   A transition from `l'=1` to the final `l=0` state gives Δl = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease again, so **n' > 1**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** By combining the conditions on `n'` (i.e., `1 < n' < 3`), the only possible integer value is **n' = 2**. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`. This means all the transition routes shown in the options are physically possible paths.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability, or branching ratio, for one specific cascade path. This is calculated as the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 (`|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-state (l=0), which is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because the initial state is symmetric and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (in the absence of external fields), the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels (`m' = -1, 0, 1`).\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of transitioning into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 (`|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Once the atom is in an intermediate `|2,1,m'⟩` state (the 2p level), its only possible decay path to a lower energy that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is to the `|1,0,0⟩` ground state.\n    *   Because this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The total probability for any single, complete route is the product of these two probabilities:\n    P(route) = P(step 1) × P(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = **1/3**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nOur analysis shows that any of the three valid cascade routes has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) `... →|2,1,0⟩→ ... and 2/3` - The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) `... →|2,1,1⟩→ ... and 1/4` - The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) `... →|2,1,-1⟩→ ... and 1/4` - The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3` - The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Process and Identify the Rules**\n\nThe problem asks for a valid pathway and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism specified is two consecutive **electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n$$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$$\n\nThis process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Energy:** For spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic H-atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0$, violating the selection rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### **2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions:\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have **`l'=1`**.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have **`m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`**.\n    *   Since `n` must decrease, **`n' < 3`**.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state with `l'=1` to the final state with `l=0` is allowed ($\\Delta l = -1$).\n    *   Since `n` must decrease, the intermediate state must have **`n' > 1`**.\n\nCombining the constraints on the principal quantum number (`1 < n' < 3`), the intermediate state must have **`n'=2`**.\nTherefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: **$|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$**. All routes listed in the options are physically allowed paths.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" here refers to the branching ratio for a specific cascade path. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    This is the crucial part of the analysis. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s-state* (`l=0`), which is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of transitioning into any of the three available magnetic sublevels (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of entering any **single specific** channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p level), its only allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available path, the transition is certain to occur. The probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe now look for the option that pairs a valid decay route with the correctly calculated probability of `1/3`.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   **Route:** Valid.\n    *   **Probability:** Correct.\n    *   This is the correct answer.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   **Route:** Valid.\n    *   **Probability:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   **Route:** Valid.\n    *   **Probability:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   **Route:** Valid (assuming typo).\n    *   **Probability:** Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches the physical analysis is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, a clear and consistent physical argument emerges. All discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from different orderings of the options provided to each agent, but the underlying reasoning is unanimous. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the ground state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 1s state). This process occurs through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the well-defined **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy, which means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n**Careful Point 1:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. This is a crucial starting point. For this hypothetical direct jump, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms that a two-step process is necessary.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must find the allowed quantum numbers for the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **From Step 1:** For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$:\n    *   Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n    *   Since the initial state has $m=0$, the rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **From Step 2:** For the transition $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. This is consistent with a starting state of $l'=1$ since $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so the intermediate state must have a principal quantum number $n' > 1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number $n'$ from both steps ($1 < n' < 3$), we can definitively say that the only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible intermediate states are the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, \\text{and } |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe question asks for the probability (more accurately, the branching ratio) of one specific path. This is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    **Careful Point 3 (The Key Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of any external fields), the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    **Careful Point 4:** Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4.

The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n3.  For spontaneous emission (decay), the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease**, as the atom loses energy.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, violating the first selection rule. This confirms that the decay must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the decay path be $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions:\n\n*   **For Step 1:** The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $n$ must decrease, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n*   **For Step 2:** The transition is from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed. Since $n$ must decrease again, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number, we find **$1 < n' < 3$**, which means the intermediate state must have **$n'=2$**. Since we already found $l'=1$, the intermediate state must be a 2p orbital. Based on the $\\Delta m$ rule, there are three possible intermediate states: **$|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$**. All routes presented in the options are, therefore, physically plausible paths.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" here refers to the branching ratio for one specific cascade path. It is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**\n    This is the most critical part of the analysis. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. S-states are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, spontaneous emission is isotropic. This implies that the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and mutually exclusive outcomes for the decay to the 2p level, the probability of the atom entering any **single specific** channel is exactly **$\\frac{1}{3}$**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only decay path to a lower energy state allowed by E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. As this is the only available channel, the probability of this second step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single, specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe now compare this result—that any of the valid decay paths has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$—with the options provided in the question prompt.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: **This option presents a valid transition route and the correctly calculated probability.**\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect (and the initial state is omitted).\n\nThe only option that matches the correct physical analysis is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Physical Process\nThe problem asks for a valid decay pathway and its corresponding probability for a Hydrogen atom transitioning from the excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state. The process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nAll the candidate answers correctly identify the fundamental principles governing this process, the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic H-atom, this means the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease** at each step.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, which violates the selection rules. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Intermediate State\nWe must find the quantum numbers $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ of the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n*   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l=\\pm1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m=0, \\pm1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since $n$ must decrease, $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. A transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ satisfies the selection rule ($\\Delta l = 0-1=-1$).\n    *   Since $n$ must decrease again, $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), we conclude that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability (or branching ratio) of a single cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step. This is the crucial part of the analysis.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, which means it is an s-state and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom cannot prefer to transition into one magnetic sublevel ($m'=-1, 0, \\text{or } 1$) over the others. The transition probability is distributed equally among the three possible states. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of decaying into any **single specific** intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (a 2p state), its only possible decay path via an E1 transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. This is the only state of lower energy that satisfies the selection rules. As it is the *only* available decay channel, the probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single, complete route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Options\nWe are looking for the option that lists a valid route and the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The transition route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect (and the option has a typo).\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly pairs a valid physical process with its probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning presented across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe question asks to identify a valid decay pathway and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum Change:** The quantum number `l` must change by `Δl = ±1`.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number Change:** The quantum number `m` must change by `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n3.  **Energy Conservation:** For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step (`n_final < n_initial`).\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because `Δl = 0`, violating the first selection rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the cascade be represented as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has `l=0`, so to satisfy `Δl = ±1`, the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n    *   The initial state has `m=0`, so `Δm = 0, ±1` allows the intermediate state to have `m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n    *   Since `n` must decrease, `n' < 3`.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 2 ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state with `l'=1` to the final state with `l=0` gives `Δl = -1`, which is allowed.\n    *   Since `n` must decrease again, `n'` must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number (`1 < n' < 3`), we find `n'` must be 2. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes presented in the options are possible pathways.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe deciding factor is the probability (or branching ratio) associated with a single, specific decay route. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    This is the most critical calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` (`l=0`) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous decay process is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is **equally likely** to decay into each of the three available magnetic sublevels (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable and mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single* specific one of them is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only possible decay channel to a lower energy state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available pathway, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nWe now compare this result—that any of the valid routes has a probability of 1/3—with the specific options provided in the question.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found across all the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to a final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a two-step cascade decay through an intermediate state.\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum Change ($\\Delta l$)**: The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number Change ($\\Delta m$)**: The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Energy Change ($\\Delta n$)**: For a spontaneous decay, the atom loses energy, which in the non-relativistic H-atom means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Forbidden Transition**: A direct, single-step transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. For such a jump, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's denote the intermediate state by $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ and apply the selection rules to both steps.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition is from the intermediate state (which must have $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$), giving $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   The energy must decrease again in this step, so the intermediate state's principal quantum number $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Uniqueness of n'**: By combining the energy constraints from both steps, we find $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. This definitively means the intermediate state must be one of the 2p orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for the atom to follow one specific path is the product of the probabilities of each step. This calculation is the core of the problem.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Crucial Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable and mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Certainty of the Second Step**: Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path available, this transition occurs with certainty. Therefore, its probability is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of 1/3.

Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to the ground state.\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 3s orbital.\n*   **Final State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n*   **Mechanism:** The decay happens via two sequential **electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This means the atom must pass through an intermediate state in a cascade decay:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nThis process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For spontaneous decay (emission of a photon), the atom's energy must decrease. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom model, this means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease in each step.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is **forbidden** because the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0-0=0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions:\n*   **Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since energy must decrease, $n' < 3$.\n*   **Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   A transition from a state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ is allowed, as $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n    *   Since energy must decrease, $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), we find the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, the intermediate state must be one of the three 2p sublevels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes presented in the options are physically valid paths according to the selection rules.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Transition Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific path is the branching ratio, which is the product of the probabilities of each step in the cascade.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$ for a specific $m'$.**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s`-state ($l=0$) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because the initial state and the E1 interaction are isotropic (in the absence of external fields), the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single one* of these states is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate `2p` state (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$), the only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy is the `1s` ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. As this is the only available pathway, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe correct answer must list a valid transition route and the correct probability of 1/3.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n    *   The route has a typo, and the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only choice that correctly pairs a valid physical process with its correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Physical Principles\n\nThe problem asks for a valid decay pathway and its associated probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The process is specified as two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number:** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Principal Quantum Number:** For a decay (spontaneous emission), energy is released, so the principal quantum number `n` must decrease in each step.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, violating the selection rules. Therefore, a two-step process via an intermediate state, let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, is required.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since this is a decay, the energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   A transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$ is allowed, as $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n    *   Since this is also a decay, the energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Thus, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$ and $l'=1$. The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This confirms that all transition routes presented in the options (A, B, C, D) are physically plausible pathways.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability (or branching ratio). The overall probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n$P_{\\text{route}} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of the first step, $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**:\n    *   **Careful Point:** The most critical insight, unanimously agreed upon by all the candidate answers, is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s`-state ($l=0$). This state is **spherically symmetric**.\n    *   In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space for the emitted photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally probable outcomes that make up all the possibilities for this transition, the probability of decaying into any **single specific** channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of the second step, $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**:\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.\n    *   Because this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for any one of the three complete cascade routes is:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = (\\frac{1}{3}) \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, any of the valid decay routes has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the specific options given in the question:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\nThe only option that combines a physically valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a comprehensive synthesis of the candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous agreement on the underlying physics. The solution can be broken down into the following step-by-step analysis, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, to the ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$, through two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay via an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** A direct, single-step transition is forbidden. This is because the electric dipole selection rules, which govern these transitions, are not met. For a transition, the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. A direct $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ transition would have $\\Delta l = 0$, making it forbidden. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\nThe E1 selection rules are:\n1.  **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum ($\\Delta l$):** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number ($\\Delta m$):** $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Change in Principal Quantum Number ($\\Delta n$):** For a decay process (spontaneous emission), the atom loses energy, so `n` must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade to identify the quantum numbers of the intermediate state, $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **For the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   Initial state has $l=0$. The $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   Initial state has $m=0$. The $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Energy must decrease, so $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **For the second step ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state (with $l'=1$) to the final state (with $l=0$) gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed.\n    *   Energy must decrease in this step as well, so $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Combining the energy constraints from both steps gives $1 < n' < 3$. The only possible integer value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$. This means the intermediate state must be one of the 2p states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition *routes* shown in the options are, therefore, physically plausible. The decision must hinge on the associated probability.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of a Specific Route\nThe total probability for the atom to follow one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($P_2$):** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, its only E1-allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only path, the transition happens with certainty. Thus, the probability for this second step is $P_2 = 1$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($P_1$):** This is the probability of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state decaying to one specific sublevel, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n    **Careful Point 3 (The crucial concept):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. `s-states` are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission from this state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate state ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and exhaustive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single specific* channel is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single route is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Conclude\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer must pair a physically valid transition route with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly describes a possible physical process with its corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous agreement on the physical principles and the final calculated result. The variations in the final letter choices of the candidates are due to the randomization of the option order they were presented with. Here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules:**\n    *   The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it must pass through an intermediate state.\n    *   The process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n        *   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   The change in magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   For decay, energy must be released, so the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease in each step.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l=0$.

The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\nThis process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n3.  For spontaneous emission (decay), the energy of the atom must decrease. In the non-relativistic H-atom, this means the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease** at each step.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Path of the Two-Step Decay\nThe decay must proceed through an intermediate state: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's call the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have **$l' = 1$**.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so **$n' < 3$**.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state can have **$m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$**.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   This transition must go from $l'=1$ to the final state's $l=0$, giving $\\Delta l = -1$. This is allowed.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so **$n' > 1$**.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Intermediate State:** Combining the constraints on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the intermediate state must have **$n'=2$**. Therefore, the decay proceeds through the $n=2, l=1$ (2p) level. The three possible pathways involve the intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes shown in the options are physically valid paths.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability of a single, specific decay path is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each individual step.\n$P(\\text{total route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    This is the most critical calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, making it an **s-state**. A key property of s-states is that they are **spherically symmetric**. In the absence of external fields, this means there is no preferred direction in space for the spontaneous emission. The decay is isotropic. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable outcomes, the probability of decaying into any **single one** of these specific states is exactly **$\\frac{1}{3}$**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    Once the atom is in a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, the only possible E1 decay path to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{total route}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nWe need to find the option that presents a valid decay route and pairs it with the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: **The route is valid, and the probability is correct.**\n*   **D) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: This option has a typo.

Understand the Physical Process and Identify Governing Rules**\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, to the ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay is not direct but occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.

The steps and careful points below synthesize this consensus to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state `|3,0,0⟩` to the final state `|1,0,0⟩`. The mechanism is specified as **two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions**, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe entire process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **Δl = ±1**.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **Δm = 0, ±1**.\n3.  For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy, meaning the principal quantum number **n must decrease** at each step.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A direct one-step transition from `|3,0,0⟩` to `|1,0,0⟩` is forbidden. For such a transition, Δl = 0 - 0 = 0, which violates the Δl = ±1 rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be denoted by `|n',l',m'⟩`. We can find its properties by applying the selection rules to both steps of the cascade:\n\n*   **First Transition: `|3,0,0⟩ → |n',l',m'⟩`**\n    *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n    *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have **m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}**.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so **n' < 3**.\n\n*   **Second Transition: `|n',l',m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`**\n    *   A transition from `l'=1` to the final `l=0` state gives Δl = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease again, so **n' > 1**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** By combining the conditions on `n'` (i.e., `1 < n' < 3`), the only possible integer value is **n' = 2**. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: `|2,1,-1⟩`, `|2,1,0⟩`, and `|2,1,1⟩`. This means all the transition routes shown in the options are physically possible paths.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe deciding factor is the probability, or branching ratio, for one specific cascade path. This is calculated as the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 (`|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩`):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The initial state `|3,0,0⟩` is an s-state (l=0), which is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because the initial state is symmetric and spontaneous emission is an isotropic process (in the absence of external fields), the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels (`m' = -1, 0, 1`).\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of transitioning into any *single specific* intermediate state is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 (`|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩`):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Once the atom is in an intermediate `|2,1,m'⟩` state (the 2p level), its only possible decay path to a lower energy that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is to the `|1,0,0⟩` ground state.\n    *   Because this is the only available decay channel, the probability of this second transition is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The total probability for any single, complete route is the product of these two probabilities:\n    P(route) = P(step 1) × P(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = **1/3**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nOur analysis shows that any of the three valid cascade routes has a probability of 1/3. We now evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) `... →|2,1,0⟩→ ... and 2/3` - The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) `... →|2,1,1⟩→ ... and 1/4` - The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) `... →|2,1,-1⟩→ ... and 1/4` - The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3` - The transition route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Process and Identify the Rules**\n\nThe problem asks for a valid pathway and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism specified is two consecutive **electric dipole (E1) transitions**. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state:\n$$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$$\n\nThis process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number:** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Energy:** For spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic H-atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0$, violating the selection rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### **2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions:\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have **`l'=1`**.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have **`m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`**.\n    *   Since `n` must decrease, **`n' < 3`**.\n\n*   **For the second transition ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   The transition from the intermediate state with `l'=1` to the final state with `l=0` is allowed ($\\Delta l = -1$).\n    *   Since `n` must decrease, the intermediate state must have **`n' > 1`**.\n\nCombining the constraints on the principal quantum number (`1 < n' < 3`), the intermediate state must have **`n'=2`**.\nTherefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: **$|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$**. All routes listed in the options are physically allowed paths.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" here refers to the branching ratio for a specific cascade path. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    This is the crucial part of the analysis. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s-state* (`l=0`), which is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of transitioning into any of the three available magnetic sublevels (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of entering any **single specific** channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p level), its only allowed decay channel to a lower energy state is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available path, the transition is certain to occur. The probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **4.

All discrepancies in the final letter choices stem from different orderings of the options provided to each agent, but the underlying reasoning is unanimous. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the excited state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the ground state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 1s state). This process occurs through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the well-defined **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in orbital angular momentum must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy, which means the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($\\Delta n < 0$).\n\n**Careful Point 1:** A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden. This is a crucial starting point. For this hypothetical direct jump, the change in orbital angular momentum would be $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. This confirms that a two-step process is necessary.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nThe decay must proceed as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We must find the allowed quantum numbers for the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **From Step 1:** For the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$:\n    *   Since the initial state has $l=0$, the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ requires the intermediate state to have $l'=1$.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n    *   Since the initial state has $m=0$, the rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **From Step 2:** For the transition $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. This is consistent with a starting state of $l'=1$ since $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$.\n    *   The energy must decrease, so the intermediate state must have a principal quantum number $n' > 1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number $n'$ from both steps ($1 < n' < 3$), we can definitively say that the only possible integer value is $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible intermediate states are the three degenerate sublevels of the 2p orbital: $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, \\text{and } |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe question asks for the probability (more accurately, the branching ratio) of one specific path. This is the product of the probabilities of each individual step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    **Careful Point 3 (The Key Insight):** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` ($l=0$) and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, and the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission (in the absence of any external fields), the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability for any *single specific* channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    **Careful Point 4:** Once the atom is in an intermediate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, its only possible decay path to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**4.

The differences in the final letter choices are due to variations in how the options were ordered for each agent.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process and Governing Rules**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state, $|3,0,0\\rangle$, to the ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies the decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **Δl = ±1**.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **Δm = 0, ±1**.\n*   For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy, meaning the principal quantum number **n must decrease** at each step.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because for this path, Δl = 0, which violates the selection rules. This confirms the necessity of a two-step cascade decay.\n\n**2. Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the cascade be represented as: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy Δm=0,±1, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since energy must decrease, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   This transition from $l'=1$ to the final state's $l=0$ is allowed, as Δl = -1.\n    *   Since energy must decrease again, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, the intermediate state must be one of the three 2p sublevels: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means that all the decay paths listed in the options are physically plausible. The deciding factor is the probability.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of the atom following one specific cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   **Crucial Point:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an **s-state**. S-states are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   In the absence of external fields, spontaneous emission from a spherically symmetric state is **isotropic** (the same in all directions).\n    *   Consequently, the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).

The different letter choices among the candidates arise from variations in the order of options they were presented with. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown of the correct reasoning.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Physical Process and Apply Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is a two-step cascade decay, with each step being an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nThe process must obey the E1 selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n3.  For spontaneous emission (decay), the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease**, as the atom loses energy.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, violating the first selection rule. This confirms that the decay must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State**\n\nLet the decay path be $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both transitions:\n\n*   **For Step 1:** The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$. Since $n$ must decrease, $n'$ must be less than 3.\n*   **For Step 2:** The transition is from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ to the final state with $l=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = -1$, which is allowed. Since $n$ must decrease again, $n'$ must be greater than 1.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number, we find **$1 < n' < 3$**, which means the intermediate state must have **$n'=2$**. Since we already found $l'=1$, the intermediate state must be a 2p orbital. Based on the $\\Delta m$ rule, there are three possible intermediate states: **$|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$**. All routes presented in the options are, therefore, physically plausible paths.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe \"probability\" here refers to the branching ratio for one specific cascade path. It is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1: ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$)**\n    This is the most critical part of the analysis. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, making it an `s-state`. S-states are **spherically symmetric**, meaning they have no preferred orientation in space. In the absence of external fields, spontaneous emission is isotropic. This implies that the atom has an **equal probability** of decaying into each of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$). Since there are three equally likely and mutually exclusive outcomes for the decay to the 2p level, the probability of the atom entering any **single specific** channel is exactly **$\\frac{1}{3}$**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2: ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$)**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the only decay path to a lower energy state allowed by E1 selection rules is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. As this is the only available channel, the probability of this second step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single, specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe now compare this result—that any of the valid decay paths has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$—with the options provided in the question prompt.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: **This option presents a valid transition route and the correctly calculated probability.**\n*   **D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect (and the initial state is omitted).\n\nThe only option that matches the correct physical analysis is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Physical Process\nThe problem asks for a valid decay pathway and its corresponding probability for a Hydrogen atom transitioning from the excited state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two sequential electric dipole (E1) transitions, which implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state. The process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1 step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nAll the candidate answers correctly identify the fundamental principles governing this process, the E1 selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**.\n*   For spontaneous emission (decay), the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic H-atom, this means the principal quantum number **$n$ must decrease** at each step.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, which violates the selection rules. This confirms the necessity of the two-step process.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Intermediate State\nWe must find the quantum numbers $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ of the intermediate state by applying the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n*   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l=\\pm1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m=0, \\pm1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Since $n$ must decrease, $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. A transition from an intermediate state with $l'=1$ satisfies the selection rule ($\\Delta l = 0-1=-1$).\n    *   Since $n$ must decrease again, $n' > 1$.\n\nCombining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), we conclude that the intermediate state must have $n'=2$. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe probability (or branching ratio) of a single cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step. This is the crucial part of the analysis.\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, which means it is an s-state and is **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Because of this symmetry, spontaneous emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom cannot prefer to transition into one magnetic sublevel ($m'=-1, 0, \\text{or } 1$) over the others. The transition probability is distributed equally among the three possible states. Since there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of decaying into any **single specific** intermediate state is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (a 2p state), its only possible decay path via an E1 transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. This is the only state of lower energy that satisfies the selection rules. As it is the *only* available decay channel, the probability of this step is **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The overall probability for any single, complete route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{\\text{total}} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Options\nWe are looking for the option that lists a valid route and the correctly calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: The transition route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect (and the option has a typo).\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly pairs a valid physical process with its probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning presented across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Physical Process and Governing Rules\nThe question asks to identify a valid decay pathway and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the E1 selection rules:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum Change:** The quantum number `l` must change by `Δl = ±1`.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number Change:** The quantum number `m` must change by `Δm = 0, ±1`.\n3.  **Energy Conservation:** For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step (`n_final < n_initial`).\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because `Δl = 0`, violating the first selection rule. This confirms the necessity of a two-step process.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the cascade be represented as $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to determine the properties of the intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   The initial state has `l=0`, so to satisfy `Δl = ±1`, the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n    *   The initial state has `m=0`, so `Δm = 0, ±1` allows the intermediate state to have `m' ∈ {-1, 0, 1}`.\n    *   Since `n` must decrease, `n' < 3`.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 2 ($|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   A transition from the intermediate state with `l'=1` to the final state with `l=0` gives `Δl = -1`, which is allowed.\n    *   Since `n` must decrease again, `n'` must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** By combining the conditions on the principal quantum number (`1 < n' < 3`), we find `n'` must be 2. Therefore, there are three possible, physically valid intermediate states: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All transition routes presented in the options are possible pathways.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe deciding factor is the probability (or branching ratio) associated with a single, specific decay route. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    This is the most critical calculation. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an `s-state` (`l=0`) and is therefore **spherically symmetric**. It has no preferred orientation in space. Due to this symmetry, the spontaneous decay process is isotropic (the same in all directions). Consequently, the atom is **equally likely** to decay into each of the three available magnetic sublevels (`m'=-1, 0, 1`) of the intermediate state. Since there are three equally probable and mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of decaying into any *single* specific one of them is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level), the only possible decay channel to a lower energy state that satisfies the E1 selection rules is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state. Since this is the only available pathway, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any single specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n    $P_{total} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nWe now compare this result—that any of the valid routes has a probability of 1/3—with the specific options provided in the question.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

A careful examination of all the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical reasoning, which leads to a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Physical Process and Identify the Rules\nThe question describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The mechanism is specified as two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means the decay is a two-step cascade process that passes through an intermediate state.\n\nThe process is governed by the **E1 selection rules**:\n1.  **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The quantum number `l` must change by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  **Magnetic Quantum Number:** The quantum number `m` must change by $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  **Energy:** For a spontaneous decay, the atom must lose energy. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, this means the principal quantum number `n` must decrease at each step.\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0-0 = 0$, violating the first selection rule. This confirms that a two-step process is necessary.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 1:** The transition is from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Analysis of Step 2:** The transition is to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   The final state has $l=0$. A transition from the intermediate state with $l'=1$ is allowed since $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n    *   The principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the Intermediate State:** Combining the conditions on the principal quantum number ($1 < n' < 3$), the only possible integer value is $n'=2$. Therefore, the intermediate state must be a `2p` state. The three possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. This means that all the transition *routes* shown in the options are physically valid pathways.

All s-states are **spherically symmetric**. This means the atom has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state and the interaction for spontaneous emission are isotropic (in the absence of external fields), the decay has no preferred direction. This means the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three available magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the intermediate state.\n    *   Since there are three equally probable, exhaustive outcomes for this decay step, the probability of decaying into any **single specific** channel is exactly **1/3**.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2 ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$)**:\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state like $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the only decay path to a lower energy state that is allowed by the E1 selection rules is the transition to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ground state.\n    *   Since this is the only available decay channel, this transition occurs with a probability of **1**.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    The overall probability for any of the three complete cascade routes is the product of the two step-probabilities:\n    $P(\\text{route}) = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nWe need to find the option that pairs a valid physical route with the correctly calculated probability of `1/3`.\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.
