All candidate answers correctly identify that this requires two fundamental principles of planetary physics:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature vs. Orbital Distance (a):** For planets orbiting the same star with identical albedo, the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance ($a$).\n        *   $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$).\n        *   $P^2 \\propto a^3$ or $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n2.  **Combine the Principles:** The most efficient method, employed by nearly all candidates, is to synthesize these two laws into a single direct relationship between period ($P$) and temperature ($T_{eq}$).\n    *   From the temperature law, solve for distance: $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$.\n    *   Substitute this into Kepler's Law: $P \\propto (T_{eq}^{-2})^{3/2}$.\n    *   Simplifying the exponent gives the final relationship: $P \\propto T_{eq}^{-3}$.\n    *   This establishes that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:** Based on the derived relationship, the ratio we need is $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}})^{3}$.\n    *   First, calculate the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 by multiplying the given intermediate ratios:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}} = \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n    *   Next, cube this result to find the period ratio:\n        $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The calculated numerical value is approximately **33.4**.

The mass is considered negligible for this application of Kepler's Law, and the albedo term cancels out because it's equal for all planets. This is a common feature in physics problems to test conceptual understanding over rote calculation.\n*   **Intermediate Value Traps:** The options are deliberately designed to trap common mistakes.

Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Goal**\nThe core task is to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. This requires calculating the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Physical Principles**\nThere is a strong consensus among the candidate answers on the two fundamental physics principles required:\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature vs. Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a given star with a constant albedo is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance ($a$).\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$).\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$ which can be written as $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Principles into a Direct Relationship**\nThe most efficient path to the solution, used by nearly all agents, is to combine these two principles to establish a direct relationship between orbital period ($P$) and equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$).\n*   From the temperature law, we can express distance in terms of temperature: $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$.\n*   Substitute this expression for distance into Kepler's Law: $P \\propto a^{3/2} \\implies P \\propto (T_{eq}^{-2})^{3/2}$.\n*   Simplifying the exponent gives the final, powerful relationship:\n    $P \\propto T_{eq}^{-3}$\nThis shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nBased on the relationship derived above, the desired period ratio can be expressed as:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}})^{3}$\n\n*   **First, calculate the temperature ratio ($T_{eq,1}/T_{eq,3}$):** This is done by multiplying the given intermediate ratios.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}} = \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\n*   **Next, calculate the final period ratio:** Substitute the temperature ratio into the period ratio formula.\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\n**5.

The mass ratios and the specific albedo value of 0.3 are distractors. The crucial information is that the albedo is the *same* for all planets, causing it to cancel out in ratio calculations.\n*   **Intermediate Answer Traps:** The options are designed to trap common mistakes.

This indicates that the options were presented to them in a different order. Therefore, the decision must be based on the robustly calculated numerical result and the specific list of options provided in the problem description, not on the letters chosen by the other agents.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical steps required to solve the problem.

A student must complete all steps to arrive at the correct period ratio.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** The final answer is highly sensitive to using the correct exponents in the physical laws ($a^{-1/2}$, $a^{3/2}$) and the final derived relationship ($T_{eq}^{-3}$). Any mistake here would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation:** There is an overwhelming consensus among the candidate answers that the correct physical reasoning leads to a numerical result of approximately 33.4. The discrepancy in the final letter choices among agents is due to the option lists being presented in different orders, not from an error in the calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
