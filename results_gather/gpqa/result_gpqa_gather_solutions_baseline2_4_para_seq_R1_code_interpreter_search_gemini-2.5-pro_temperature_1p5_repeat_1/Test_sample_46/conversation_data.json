The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the randomization of the option list for each agent, not a disagreement in the scientific analysis. The following is a step-by-step consolidation of the correct reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This evidence rules out structures that have secondary amines or amides, like N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. The value is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which would absorb < 1700 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester whose C=O bond is conjugated with a benzene ring. This evidence rules out amide structures like 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, such as 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the highly downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This proves the methylene (-CH₂-) group is bonded directly to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the amine (-NH₂) protons, corroborating the IR data.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer Derivation**\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to one unambiguous structure:\n*   A benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   The substituents are in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nFinally, this structure is matched against the original list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect. It is an amide and is meta-substituted.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect. The ethyl group's NMR quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from all the candidate agents.\n\n### **1. Consensus among Agents**\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a remarkable and unanimous agreement on the chemical interpretation of the data. Every agent, through sound and consistent reasoning, arrives at the exact same chemical structure. The only discrepancies are in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D), which is a clear artifact of the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The core chemical analysis is flawless and universally agreed upon.\n\n### **2. Synthesis of the Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe correct, logical deduction that all agents followed is:\n\n*   **Step 2a: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional pi bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Step 2b: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. This frequency is consistent with a conjugated **ester**, as it is typically higher than the C=O stretch of a conjugated amide.\n\n*   **Step 2c: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** form a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts indicate the substituents are electronically different (one donating, one withdrawing).\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** are the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. This highly deshielded position proves the -CH₂- group is attached directly to the very electronegative oxygen atom of an ester functional group, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the IR analysis.\n\n### **3. Assembling the Final Structure**\nThe combined spectral evidence points unequivocally to one structure: a benzene ring that is para-substituted with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\nBased on the question provided, the options are:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectroscopic data derived above.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is incorrect. It is a meta-substituted compound (not para) and an amide (not an ester).\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is incorrect. It is an isomer, but the quartet for the ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, causing it to appear around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is incorrect. It is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis unanimously and conclusively identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. As per the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nA comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the original spectral data reveals a unanimous conclusion on the chemical structure, with discrepancies only arising from the randomization of the multiple-choice option letters presented to each agent. The chemical reasoning is uniformly sound across all responses.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step breakdown to confirm the correct answer:\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator for a molecule containing a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) based on the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, strong bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This single piece of evidence rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (<1700 cm⁻¹) but is perfectly consistent with an **ester** whose carbonyl group is conjugated with the aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound possesses both a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The differing chemical shifts indicate one substituent is electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons).\n*   **Peaks at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair is the clear signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. Such a strongly deshielded position indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is bonded directly to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen atom of the ester group (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the compound is an **ethyl ester**.\n*   **Peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons from the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Final Verification:**\n*   **Identified Fragments:**\n    *   A 1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring\n    *   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n    *   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   **Final Structure:** The only way to combine these pieces is to form **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   **Evaluating Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral evidence.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. It is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect isomer. The quartet for its ethyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. It is meta-substituted and an amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning from all candidate answers, confirmed by this analysis, identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Matching this to the provided option list gives A as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer based on the provided data and the consensus from the candidate agents. The reasoning provided by the candidate agents is uniformly correct, and the discrepancy in their final letter choices stems from the randomization of the options list, not from any error in chemical analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** A Degree of Unsaturation of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (the 5th degree), which, given the presence of two oxygen atoms, is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum\n*   **Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This is a crucial piece of evidence that rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. Its frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to an aromatic ring. The frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would generally appear below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This confirms the substitution pattern of the benzene ring.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) unmistakably indicate an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached directly to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of the ester group (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the compound is an ethyl ester.\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options\nThe combined spectral evidence points unequivocally to a single structure assembled from the following fragments:\n1.  A 1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group\n\nThe only structure that fits all this evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Now we evaluate the original options provided:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer (`H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`). Critically, the NMR signal for the ethyl group's -CH₂- protons would be next to the carbonyl carbon, giving a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence: the molecular formula, the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, the para-disubstituted ring, and all the corresponding chemical shifts, multiplicities, and integrations in the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers and a detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, a single, unambiguous conclusion can be reached. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2), which equals **5**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O). All candidate analyses correctly made this initial deduction.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. The two peaks correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively. This fact immediately rules out any structure that does not contain a primary amine, such as the secondary amide in option D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a **carbonyl (C=O)** group. Its specific frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**, which fits perfectly with the deduction of a benzene ring. It is too high in frequency to be a typical amide, such as in option B, 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, such as option B, 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** clearly represent an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene group (-CH₂-) this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester (**-O-CH₂CH₃**).\n    *   This chemical shift value decisively rules out the isomer in option A, 4-aminophenyl propionate. In that molecule, the methylene group would be attached to the carbonyl carbon (-CO-CH₂CH₃), and its signal would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nEvery piece of evidence converges on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nAll candidate answers, despite differences in the final letter they selected, correctly identified the structure through this same line of sound chemical reasoning. The discrepancy in their final letter choice is simply due to the options being randomized in their individual prompts.\n\nBased on the list of options provided with the question:\nA) 4-aminophenyl propionate\nB) 3-ethoxybenzamide\nC) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\nD) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nThe correct answer is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers and a careful re-examination of the spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be conclusively identified. The reasoning across all candidate answers is uniformly sound, pointing to the same chemical structure. The variation in the final letter choices is due to the options being listed in a different random order for each agent, not from any error in the chemical analysis.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation**: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (the 5th degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester** that is conjugated to an aromatic ring. The frequency is too high to be a typical amide, which would absorb at a lower wavenumber (e.g., < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This immediately rules out any ortho- or meta-substituted isomers.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial piece of information is the downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which perfectly corroborates the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Fragments and Final Evaluation:**\nAll pieces of evidence point to one unique structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data showing a primary amine.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: Incorrect. This is a structural isomer. Its NMR signal for the ethyl group's -CH₂- protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: Incorrect. This compound is an amide (not an ester) and is meta-substituted (not para), both of which are contradicted by the spectral data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer by synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For this formula, DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** All analyses correctly agree that a DoU of 5 indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional pi bond, which, given the presence of two oxygen atoms, is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This key piece of evidence eliminates any structure that is not a primary amine.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester** that is conjugated to a benzene ring. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would generally appear below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The unknown compound contains both a primary amine group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This means the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the clear signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene group (-CH₂-) this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom. This position is characteristic of a methylene group attached to the oxygen of an ester (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, which integrates to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons on a primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nBased on the evidence:\n1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents in a **para** arrangement.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nCombining these fragments leads to a single, unambiguous structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow we match this confirmed structure to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: **Incorrect.** This is a secondary amide, which is ruled out by the IR and NMR data showing a primary amine.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: **Incorrect.** This is an isomer (H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). In this structure, the quartet from the ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, not an ester oxygen, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed signal at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence: it is a para-disubstituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group, accounting for all observed spectral features.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: **Incorrect.** This is a meta-substituted compound (not para) and an amide (not an ester), both of which are contradicted by the data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA comprehensive analysis of the spectral data leads to a definitive conclusion. The reasoning is consistent across all candidate answers, even if their final letter choices differ due to randomization of the options.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 strongly indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This evidence rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines, such as **(B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. Its frequency is typical for an **ester** conjugated to an aromatic ring. This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide, ruling out **(D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This confirms the para substitution pattern and provides further evidence against the meta-substituted **(D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This highly deshielded position indicates the -CH₂- group is bonded directly to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester functional group. This confirms the fragment is an **ethyl ester (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options:**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence points to a single structure containing:\n*   A 1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: Incorrect. This is an isomer where the quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl, giving a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the primary amine data from the IR and NMR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct**. This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectral data: the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, the para-disubstituted ring, and all the corresponding chemical shifts.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with both the substitution pattern and the functional groups identified.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on the provided spectroscopic data and a synthesis of the consensus reasoning from the other agents.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n*   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = **5**.\n*   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (the 5th degree). Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Key Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Key Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. Its specific frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to a benzene ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which usually absorbs at a lower frequency, < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The separation in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents are electronically different (one donating, one withdrawing).\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) clearly indicate an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most critical piece of evidence is the quartet's chemical shift at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context must be the oxygen of the ester group (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** moiety.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet (bs) at 4.0 ppm, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nThe combined evidence from all analytical techniques points to a single structure:\n*   A benzene ring\n*   Substituted at the 1 and 4 (para) positions\n*   With a primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   And an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Now, let's evaluate the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Ruled out. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the primary amine data from the IR and NMR spectra.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Ruled out. This is a meta-substituted (1,3) amide. The NMR shows para-substitution, and the IR indicates an ester, not an amide.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of evidence: a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a para-disubstituted ring, along with all corresponding chemical shifts.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Ruled out. This is an isomer. In this structure, the ethyl group would be attached as -O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which strongly contradicts the observed shift of 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a meticulous review of the provided candidate answers and an independent analysis of the spectroscopic data, a single, unambiguous conclusion can be reached. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers is uniformly correct; the variation in the final letter chosen is a result of clerical errors or randomized option lists, not a failure in chemical analysis.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct structure and select the right option.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation**: The degree of unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This is a critical piece of evidence. The presence of *two* distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one peak in this region. This fact immediately helps eliminate certain possibilities.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency is key.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually below 1700 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Aromatic Region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**\n    *   **Interpretation**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: A meta- (1,3) or ortho- (1,2) substitution would result in a more complex splitting pattern. This confirms the para arrangement. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (e.g., -NH₂) and the other is electron-withdrawing (e.g., -COOR).\n*   **Ethyl Group: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**\n    *   **Interpretation**: This coupled triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of information in the spectrum. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the structure contains an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. It decisively rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (C), where the quartet would be for a -CO-CH₂CH₃ group and would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Amine Protons: 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**\n    *   **Interpretation**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the IR data.\n\n### **Conclusion: Assembling the Pieces**\nThe combined spectral evidence points to a single structure composed of:\n1.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n2.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n3.  A benzene ring where these two groups are attached in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis unique structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Matching the Structure to the Options**\nLet's evaluate the given options against our confirmed structure:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, contradicting the IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is meta-substituted and an amide, contradicting the NMR and IR data.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. As determined from the NMR chemical shift, this is the wrong ester isomer.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on the analysis of all provided candidate answers and the raw spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be definitively identified. There is a unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning across all agents, even though their final letter choices differ due to a randomization of the options they were shown.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the key evidence:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   This DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is consistent with an ester conjugated to an aromatic ring, and is too high to be a typical amide.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   The pattern of two doublets at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** confirms the presence of the two protons on the primary amine group.\n*   The triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** coupled with the quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)** clearly indicates an ethyl group. The crucial detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This highly downfield shift proves that the -CH₂- group is bonded directly to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n**Assembling the Structure:**\nThe combined evidence points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring that is para-substituted with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**Matching to the Options:**\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **This is the correct structure.**\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, contradicting the IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the quartet of the ethyl group would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, contradicting the evidence for a para-substituted ester.\n\nThe analysis of all data points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a systematic review of the spectral data and a synthesis of the correct reasoning present in all the candidate answers, the identity of the unknown compound can be conclusively determined. The provided candidate answers show a unanimous agreement on the chemical interpretation, with discrepancies only in the final letter choice due to variations in how the options were listed.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer:\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For this compound, DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (accounting for the 5th degree), which, given the two oxygen atoms, is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately eliminates structures with secondary amines or amides, such as **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to a benzene ring. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This fact rules out amide structures like **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This pattern rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, providing further evidence against **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) coupled with a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group at such a low field must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the compound is an ethyl ester.\n*   **Distinguishing Isomers:** This chemical shift at 4.5 ppm is crucial for differentiating between the remaining possibilities:\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Contains the H₂N-Ph-CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃ fragment. The bolded -CH₂- group attached to the ester oxygen is expected to have a chemical shift around 4.2-4.5 ppm. This matches the data perfectly.\n    *   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This isomer has the structure H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**CH₃. The bolded -CH₂- group is adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm. This contradicts the observed data.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet integrating to two protons at 4.0 ppm is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll spectral data points converge on a single, unambiguous structure. The molecule is a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) as substituents. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this correct structure to the provided options confirms that the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the spectral data and the reasoning presented in the candidate answers, a clear and definitive conclusion can be reached. The reasoning across all 15 candidate answers is chemically sound and unanimously identifies the correct compound, with discrepancies only arising from the different ordering of options presented to each agent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms present.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately makes structures that are not primary amines, like option (A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (a secondary amide), highly unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. Its frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to an aromatic ring. The value is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option C), which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, such as option (C) 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.

A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be bonded to a highly electronegative atom, confirming it is attached to the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester** fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   This single piece of data allows a decisive choice between the two remaining para-substituted ester isomers. It confirms ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (B) and rules out 4-aminophenyl propionate (D), where the quartet would be next to a carbonyl carbon and appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4.

Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, strong bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This observation is critical as it rules out any structures containing secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its specific frequency is consistent with an **ester conjugated** to an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which usually absorbs < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains both a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, represent a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out any ortho or meta isomers.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.

They correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NHR₂) or an amide would only show a single peak in this region. This evidence immediately rules out any option that is not a primary amine, such as **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with a benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which would appear <1700 cm⁻¹), ruling out amide-containing options like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, form a classic A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') pattern.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the definitive fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern confirms the substitution is on opposite ends of the ring, further ruling out the meta-substituted **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** A coupled triplet and quartet signify an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the single most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This fact allows for the crucial distinction between the two ester isomers:\n        *   **It confirms ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (D)**, which has the H₂N-Ph-CO-**O-CH₂**-CH₃ structure.\n        *   **It decisively rules out 4-aminophenyl propionate (B)**, whose structure is H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**-CH₃. In this isomer, the quartet for the bolded -CH₂- group would appear much further upfield, at approximately 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nEvery piece of evidence converges to identify one unique structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1- and 4-positions with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The correct compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (Secondary amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (Wrong ester isomer; NMR chemical shift mismatch).\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (Meta-substituted amide).\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** - Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the randomization of the option list for each agent, not a disagreement in the scientific analysis. The following is a step-by-step consolidation of the correct reasoning.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (1 degree), most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This evidence rules out structures that have secondary amines or amides, like N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. The value is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which would absorb < 1700 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester whose C=O bond is conjugated with a benzene ring. This evidence rules out amide structures like 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, such as 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the highly downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This proves the methylene (-CH₂-) group is bonded directly to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the amine (-NH₂) protons, corroborating the IR data.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer Derivation**\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to one unambiguous structure:\n*   A benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   The substituents are in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nFinally, this structure is matched against the original list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect. It is an amide and is meta-substituted.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect. The ethyl group's NMR quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from all the candidate agents.\n\n### **1. Consensus among Agents**\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a remarkable and unanimous agreement on the chemical interpretation of the data. Every agent, through sound and consistent reasoning, arrives at the exact same chemical structure. The only discrepancies are in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D), which is a clear artifact of the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The core chemical analysis is flawless and universally agreed upon.\n\n### **2. Synthesis of the Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe correct, logical deduction that all agents followed is:\n\n*   **Step 2a: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional pi bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Step 2b: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. This frequency is consistent with a conjugated **ester**, as it is typically higher than the C=O stretch of a conjugated amide.\n\n*   **Step 2c: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** form a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts indicate the substituents are electronically different (one donating, one withdrawing).\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** are the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. This highly deshielded position proves the -CH₂- group is attached directly to the very electronegative oxygen atom of an ester functional group, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the IR analysis.\n\n### **3. Assembling the Final Structure**\nThe combined spectral evidence points unequivocally to one structure: a benzene ring that is para-substituted with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\nBased on the question provided, the options are:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectroscopic data derived above.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is incorrect. It is a meta-substituted compound (not para) and an amide (not an ester).\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is incorrect. It is an isomer, but the quartet for the ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, causing it to appear around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is incorrect. It is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe analysis unanimously and conclusively identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. As per the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nA comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the original spectral data reveals a unanimous conclusion on the chemical structure, with discrepancies only arising from the randomization of the multiple-choice option letters presented to each agent. The chemical reasoning is uniformly sound across all responses.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step breakdown to confirm the correct answer:\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator for a molecule containing a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) based on the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, strong bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This single piece of evidence rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (<1700 cm⁻¹) but is perfectly consistent with an **ester** whose carbonyl group is conjugated with the aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound possesses both a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The differing chemical shifts indicate one substituent is electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons).\n*   **Peaks at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair is the clear signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. Such a strongly deshielded position indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is bonded directly to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen atom of the ester group (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the compound is an **ethyl ester**.\n*   **Peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons from the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Final Verification:**\n*   **Identified Fragments:**\n    *   A 1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring\n    *   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n    *   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   **Final Structure:** The only way to combine these pieces is to form **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   **Evaluating Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral evidence.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. It is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect isomer. The quartet for its ethyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. It is meta-substituted and an amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning from all candidate answers, confirmed by this analysis, identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Matching this to the provided option list gives A as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer based on the provided data and the consensus from the candidate agents. The reasoning provided by the candidate agents is uniformly correct, and the discrepancy in their final letter choices stems from the randomization of the options list, not from any error in chemical analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** A Degree of Unsaturation of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (the 5th degree), which, given the presence of two oxygen atoms, is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum\n*   **Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This is a crucial piece of evidence that rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. Its frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to an aromatic ring. The frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would generally appear below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This confirms the substitution pattern of the benzene ring.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) unmistakably indicate an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached directly to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of the ester group (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the compound is an ethyl ester.\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options\nThe combined spectral evidence points unequivocally to a single structure assembled from the following fragments:\n1.  A 1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring\n2.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group\n\nThe only structure that fits all this evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Now we evaluate the original options provided:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer (`H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`). Critically, the NMR signal for the ethyl group's -CH₂- protons would be next to the carbonyl carbon, giving a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence: the molecular formula, the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, the para-disubstituted ring, and all the corresponding chemical shifts, multiplicities, and integrations in the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers and a detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, a single, unambiguous conclusion can be reached. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2), which equals **5**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O). All candidate analyses correctly made this initial deduction.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. The two peaks correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively. This fact immediately rules out any structure that does not contain a primary amine, such as the secondary amide in option D, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a **carbonyl (C=O)** group. Its specific frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**, which fits perfectly with the deduction of a benzene ring. It is too high in frequency to be a typical amide, such as in option B, 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, such as option B, 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** clearly represent an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene group (-CH₂-) this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester (**-O-CH₂CH₃**).\n    *   This chemical shift value decisively rules out the isomer in option A, 4-aminophenyl propionate. In that molecule, the methylene group would be attached to the carbonyl carbon (-CO-CH₂CH₃), and its signal would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nEvery piece of evidence converges on a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nAll candidate answers, despite differences in the final letter they selected, correctly identified the structure through this same line of sound chemical reasoning. The discrepancy in their final letter choice is simply due to the options being randomized in their individual prompts.\n\nBased on the list of options provided with the question:\nA) 4-aminophenyl propionate\nB) 3-ethoxybenzamide\nC) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\nD) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nThe correct answer is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive review of the candidate answers and a careful re-examination of the spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be conclusively identified. The reasoning across all candidate answers is uniformly sound, pointing to the same chemical structure. The variation in the final letter choices is due to the options being listed in a different random order for each agent, not from any error in the chemical analysis.\n\nHere is the definitive step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation**: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (the 5th degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester** that is conjugated to an aromatic ring. The frequency is too high to be a typical amide, which would absorb at a lower wavenumber (e.g., < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This immediately rules out any ortho- or meta-substituted isomers.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial piece of information is the downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be directly bonded to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which perfectly corroborates the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Fragments and Final Evaluation:**\nAll pieces of evidence point to one unique structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data showing a primary amine.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: Incorrect. This is a structural isomer. Its NMR signal for the ethyl group's -CH₂- protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: Incorrect. This compound is an amide (not an ester) and is meta-substituted (not para), both of which are contradicted by the spectral data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer by synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For this formula, DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** All analyses correctly agree that a DoU of 5 indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional pi bond, which, given the presence of two oxygen atoms, is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This key piece of evidence eliminates any structure that is not a primary amine.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester** that is conjugated to a benzene ring. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would generally appear below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The unknown compound contains both a primary amine group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This means the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the clear signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene group (-CH₂-) this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom. This position is characteristic of a methylene group attached to the oxygen of an ester (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, which integrates to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons on a primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nBased on the evidence:\n1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents in a **para** arrangement.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nCombining these fragments leads to a single, unambiguous structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow we match this confirmed structure to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: **Incorrect.** This is a secondary amide, which is ruled out by the IR and NMR data showing a primary amine.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: **Incorrect.** This is an isomer (H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). In this structure, the quartet from the ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, not an ester oxygen, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed signal at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence: it is a para-disubstituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group, accounting for all observed spectral features.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: **Incorrect.** This is a meta-substituted compound (not para) and an amide (not an ester), both of which are contradicted by the data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA comprehensive analysis of the spectral data leads to a definitive conclusion. The reasoning is consistent across all candidate answers, even if their final letter choices differ due to randomization of the options.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n*   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 strongly indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This evidence rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines, such as **(B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) group**. Its frequency is typical for an **ester** conjugated to an aromatic ring. This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide, ruling out **(D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This confirms the para substitution pattern and provides further evidence against the meta-substituted **(D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This highly deshielded position indicates the -CH₂- group is bonded directly to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester functional group. This confirms the fragment is an **ethyl ester (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options:**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence points to a single structure containing:\n*   A 1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: Incorrect. This is an isomer where the quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl, giving a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the primary amine data from the IR and NMR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct**. This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectral data: the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, the para-disubstituted ring, and all the corresponding chemical shifts.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with both the substitution pattern and the functional groups identified.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on the provided spectroscopic data and a synthesis of the consensus reasoning from the other agents.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n*   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = **5**.\n*   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (the 5th degree). Given the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Key Peaks at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Key Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. Its specific frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to a benzene ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which usually absorbs at a lower frequency, < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The separation in chemical shifts indicates the two substituents are electronically different (one donating, one withdrawing).\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) clearly indicate an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most critical piece of evidence is the quartet's chemical shift at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context must be the oxygen of the ester group (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** moiety.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet (bs) at 4.0 ppm, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nThe combined evidence from all analytical techniques points to a single structure:\n*   A benzene ring\n*   Substituted at the 1 and 4 (para) positions\n*   With a primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   And an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Now, let's evaluate the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Ruled out. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the primary amine data from the IR and NMR spectra.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Ruled out. This is a meta-substituted (1,3) amide. The NMR shows para-substitution, and the IR indicates an ester, not an amide.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of evidence: a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a para-disubstituted ring, along with all corresponding chemical shifts.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Ruled out. This is an isomer. In this structure, the ethyl group would be attached as -O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which strongly contradicts the observed shift of 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a meticulous review of the provided candidate answers and an independent analysis of the spectroscopic data, a single, unambiguous conclusion can be reached. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers is uniformly correct; the variation in the final letter chosen is a result of clerical errors or randomized option lists, not a failure in chemical analysis.\n\nHere is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct structure and select the right option.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation**: The degree of unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This is a critical piece of evidence. The presence of *two* distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one peak in this region. This fact immediately helps eliminate certain possibilities.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency is key.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually below 1700 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests the compound is an ester, not an amide.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Aromatic Region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**\n    *   **Interpretation**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: A meta- (1,3) or ortho- (1,2) substitution would result in a more complex splitting pattern. This confirms the para arrangement. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (e.g., -NH₂) and the other is electron-withdrawing (e.g., -COOR).\n*   **Ethyl Group: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**\n    *   **Interpretation**: This coupled triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of information in the spectrum. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester. This confirms the structure contains an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**. It decisively rules out the isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (C), where the quartet would be for a -CO-CH₂CH₃ group and would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Amine Protons: 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**\n    *   **Interpretation**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), confirming the IR data.\n\n### **Conclusion: Assembling the Pieces**\nThe combined spectral evidence points to a single structure composed of:\n1.  A primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n2.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n3.  A benzene ring where these two groups are attached in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis unique structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Matching the Structure to the Options**\nLet's evaluate the given options against our confirmed structure:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, contradicting the IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is meta-substituted and an amide, contradicting the NMR and IR data.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. As determined from the NMR chemical shift, this is the wrong ester isomer.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on the analysis of all provided candidate answers and the raw spectroscopic data, the correct structure can be definitively identified. There is a unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning across all agents, even though their final letter choices differ due to a randomization of the options they were shown.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the key evidence:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   This DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are the unambiguous signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is consistent with an ester conjugated to an aromatic ring, and is too high to be a typical amide.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   The pattern of two doublets at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** confirms the presence of the two protons on the primary amine group.\n*   The triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** coupled with the quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)** clearly indicates an ethyl group. The crucial detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This highly downfield shift proves that the -CH₂- group is bonded directly to the highly electronegative oxygen atom of an ester, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n**Assembling the Structure:**\nThe combined evidence points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring that is para-substituted with a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**Matching to the Options:**\nNow, we match this confirmed structure to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **This is the correct structure.**\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, contradicting the IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this isomer, the quartet of the ethyl group would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, contradicting the evidence for a para-substituted ester.\n\nThe analysis of all data points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a systematic review of the spectral data and a synthesis of the correct reasoning present in all the candidate answers, the identity of the unknown compound can be conclusively determined. The provided candidate answers show a unanimous agreement on the chemical interpretation, with discrepancies only in the final letter choice due to variations in how the options were listed.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer:\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For this compound, DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (accounting for the 5th degree), which, given the two oxygen atoms, is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately eliminates structures with secondary amines or amides, such as **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to a benzene ring. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹). This fact rules out amide structures like **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This pattern rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, providing further evidence against **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) coupled with a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of evidence. A methylene (-CH₂-) group at such a low field must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the compound is an ethyl ester.\n*   **Distinguishing Isomers:** This chemical shift at 4.5 ppm is crucial for differentiating between the remaining possibilities:\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Contains the H₂N-Ph-CO-O-**CH₂**CH₃ fragment. The bolded -CH₂- group attached to the ester oxygen is expected to have a chemical shift around 4.2-4.5 ppm. This matches the data perfectly.\n    *   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This isomer has the structure H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂**CH₃. The bolded -CH₂- group is adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, which would result in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm. This contradicts the observed data.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet integrating to two protons at 4.0 ppm is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll spectral data points converge on a single, unambiguous structure. The molecule is a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) as substituents. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

The reasoning across all 15 candidate answers is chemically sound and unanimously identifies the correct compound, with discrepancies only arising from the different ordering of options presented to each agent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms present.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the unmistakable signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately makes structures that are not primary amines, like option (A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (a secondary amide), highly unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. Its frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated to an aromatic ring. The value is too high for a typical conjugated amide (like option C), which would absorb at a lower frequency (usually < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical pattern rules out any meta- or ortho-substituted isomers, such as option (C) 3-ethoxybenzamide.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the quartet's chemical shift at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be bonded to a highly electronegative atom, confirming it is attached to the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester** fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   This single piece of data allows a decisive choice between the two remaining para-substituted ester isomers. It confirms ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (B) and rules out 4-aminophenyl propionate (D), where the quartet would be next to a carbonyl carbon and appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = **5**.\n*   **Key Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, strong bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This observation is critical as it rules out any structures containing secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its specific frequency is consistent with an **ester conjugated** to an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which usually absorbs < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains both a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, represent a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out any ortho or meta isomers.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene group (-CH₂-) at such a downfield position must be attached to a highly electronegative atom. This confirms it is attached to the ester's oxygen, indicating an **ethyl ester fragment (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH₂) protons, corroborating the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: A primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options against this correct structure:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all aspects of the provided spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. For this structure, the quartet of the ethyl group would be next to a carbonyl carbon, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide. Both the substitution pattern and the functional group are inconsistent with the NMR and IR data.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR evidence for a primary amine.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data unequivocally identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a highly unsaturated system, typically a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. These bands correspond to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its specific frequency suggests it is a conjugated **ester**. The value is too high for a typical amide.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of two N-H bands and an ester C=O band is critical. It immediately focuses the search on structures containing both a primary amine and an ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The most crucial detail is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be bonded directly to a highly electronegative atom, confirming it is attached to the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethyl ester** fragment (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the single most powerful piece of data to distinguish between the two ester isomers, B and D. The high value confirms the -CH₂- group is attached to the ester oxygen.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options:**\nThe combined evidence points unequivocally to a structure composed of:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis leads to the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options against this conclusion:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with the para-substituted ester identified.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a structural isomer where the ethyl group's -CH₂- protons are next to the carbonyl carbon. Their NMR signal would appear around 2.5 ppm, which contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
