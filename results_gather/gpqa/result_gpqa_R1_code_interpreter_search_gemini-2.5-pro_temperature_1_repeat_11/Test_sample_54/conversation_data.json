    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signals:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** Means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group, CH3-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with the acetate methyl group.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates another methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** Means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Indicates a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This matches a vinyl proton (-CH=) that is next to another vinyl proton and a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinyl proton region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Indicates a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinyl proton region. The high value (deshielding) is due to the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl):**\n\n*   Let's sum the protons from the integration data: 3H (acetate) + 3H (methyl) + 1H (vinyl) + 1H (vinyl) = 8 protons in total.\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The formula corresponds to 8 hydrogen atoms. The propenyl group is -CH=CH-CH3. This fits our analysis: an acetate group, a vinyl proton coupled to another vinyl proton and a methyl group, another vinyl proton, and a methyl group coupled to a vinyl proton.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The formula corresponds to 10 hydrogen atoms. This does not match the integration data.\n\nTherefore, the compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options B) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe distinction between cis and trans isomers is made by looking at the coupling constant (J-value) between the two protons on the double bond.\n\n*   For **trans** isomers, the protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, and their coupling constant (³J_HH) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For **cis** isomers, the protons are on the same side of the double bond, and their coupling constant (³J_HH) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe provided data shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** for the signal at 7.0 ppm, which arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons. This large value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data corresponds to a molecule with an acetate group and a trans-propenyl group. The compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** Acetate CH3\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz):** H on the double bond next to the Oxygen, trans to the other vinyl H.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** H on the double bond next to the methyl group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** CH3 on the double bond.\n\nAll data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
