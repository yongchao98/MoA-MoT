    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Atropisomerism:** Normally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. However, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), this rotation can be restricted. This restricted rotation can lead to a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism, which results in axial chirality.\n    *   **Substituents:** In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These groups are bulky enough to prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar.\n    *   **Chirality:** Because the rings are forced into a stable, twisted conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. It is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** This molecule is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   **Groups Attached:** This carbon atom is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Any molecule with a single chiral center is chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (mirror images) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure Analysis:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with a *trans* configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is achiral. It does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate, which is the *cis* isomer, but neither compound is chiral).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** Yes (axial chirality)\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Yes (chiral center)\n*   **3. benzophenone:** No (achiral)\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:** No (achiral)\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes both 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
