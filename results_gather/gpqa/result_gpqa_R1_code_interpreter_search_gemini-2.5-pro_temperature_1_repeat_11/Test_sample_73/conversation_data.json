    "This problem deals with radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of the exponential distribution is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an event happening in a future interval is independent of how much time has already passed.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and the model:**\n    *   Let `T` be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom.\n    *   Radioactive decay follows the exponential probability law. The probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (i.e., it survives past time `t`) is given by the survival function: `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   Consequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is `P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant `λ`:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n    *   So, `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   Using the formula from step 1: `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   Rearranging the equation to find the survival probability: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   We don't need to solve for `λ` explicitly yet. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n3.  **Formulate the question mathematically:**\n    *   We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   This is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`, which simplifies to `P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the memoryless property:**\n    *   The memoryless property of exponential decay states that `P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s)`.\n    *   In our case, the probability of surviving an *additional* 150 minutes is independent of the first 50 minutes it has already survived.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that a *new* atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n    *   So, we need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final probability:**\n    *   We need to find `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   From step 2, we know `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   We can manipulate this to find `e^(-λ * 150)`.\n        *   First, take the 1/100th power of both sides: `(e^(-λ * 100))^(1/100) = 0.68^(1/100)`.\n        *   This gives `e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100)`.\n        *   Now, raise both sides to the power of 150: `(e^(-λ))^150 = (0.68^(1/100))^150`.\n        *   This simplifies to `e^(-λ * 150) = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5`.\n    *   Now we can calculate the probability of decay:\n        *   `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`.\n\nLet's compute the final value using Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate 1 - 0.68**1.5\nprobability = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = probability * 100\n\nprint(f\"The probability is {probability}\")\nprint(f\"The probability in percentage is {percentage:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that `1 - 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.4404`, which is 44.04%.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem describes a process of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of the exponential distribution is its **memoryless property**. This means that the probability of an event occurring in a future time interval is independent of how much time has already passed.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Understand the Memoryless Property:** The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future interval. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"tired.\" Its chance of decaying in the next minute is the same now as it was at the very beginning. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly created atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Model the Decay Probability:**\n    *   Let `T` be the time until the atom decays. The probability that the atom survives past time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that the atom decays *by* time `t` is `F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Parameters:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(T ≤ 100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    *   `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n    *   `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   We need to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` using the information from step 3. We can do this by recognizing that `150 = 100 * 1.5`.\n    *   `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substitute the value from step 3:\n    *   `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now, calculate the final decay probability:\n    *   `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n    *   Converting this to a percentage gives `43.93%`.\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
