    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The problem is based on the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method observes the periodic Doppler shift of the host star's spectral lines. The star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's velocity.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The Doppler shift formula is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda$ is the rest wavelength, $v_r$ is the radial velocity, and $c$ is the speed of light. The maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1}$\n    Given $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + M_{planet})^{2/3}}$\n    Assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_{planet} \\ll M_{star}$), the formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Systems:** We are given that the two systems are very similar:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have the same mass: $M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$.\n    *   The problem provides no information to suggest the orbital inclinations ($i$) are different. In such physics problems, we assume that any unmentioned parameters are the same for the systems being compared. Therefore, we assume $i_1 = i_2$.\n\n    With $M_{star}$, $M_{planet}$, and $i$ being the same for both systems, the formula for $K$ shows that $K$ is proportional to $T^{-1/3}$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio for the Periods:** We can write the relationship for our two planets as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($T_2/T_1$):** We need to rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.\n    First, cube both sides:\n    $\\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    Then, invert both sides to find the desired ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$\n\nTo get the numerical value, we perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods T2/T1.\n# This ratio is equal to (K1/K2)^3, where K is the radial velocity semi-amplitude.\n# K is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift.\n# K1 is proportional to 5 mÅ and K2 is proportional to 7 mÅ.\n\nratio_K = 5 / 7\nratio_T = ratio_K ** 3\nprint(ratio_T)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314869096234\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning for the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) of a star is directly proportional to the maximum observed periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts.\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4 $\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the host star is given by the formula:\n    $ K \\approx \\frac{M_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} $\n    where $T$ is the orbital period, $M_{planet}$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Identify Constant Parameters:** The problem states that:\n    *   The star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planet masses are the same ($M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$).\n    *   Since no other information is given, we assume other factors like the orbital inclination ($i$) are the same for both systems.\n    *   $G$ is a universal constant.\n\n4.  **Establish the Proportionality:** With all other parameters being constant, the formula simplifies to a proportionality between the radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ and the orbital period $T$:\n    $ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio of Periods:** We can write this proportionality as a ratio for our two systems:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} $\n\n6.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($T_2/T_1$):** To find the ratio of the periods, we need to rearrange the equation. First, cube both sides:\n    $ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $\n    Then, invert the equation to get the desired ratio:\n    $ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (which is the inverse of the ratio we calculated in step 1):\n    $ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 $\n    The calculation gives:\n    $ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\approx (0.714)^3 \\approx 0.364 $\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
