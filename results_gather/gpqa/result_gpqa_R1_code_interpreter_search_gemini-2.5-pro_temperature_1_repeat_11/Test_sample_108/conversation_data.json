    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the permitted and non-permitted transitions.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe system starts as a bound two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial NN state is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the total orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state `P_i` is determined by the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe initial state decays into a final NN state and a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\nWe are given the following information and must apply the corresponding conservation laws:\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n*   The transition must conserve total angular momentum and parity.\n*   The final NN state must obey the Pauli statistics rule provided.\n\nLet's establish the rules that a permitted transition must satisfy. The quantum numbers for the final NN state are `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and for particle X, the orbital angular momentum is `l_X`.\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe initial total angular momentum `J_i` must equal the final total angular momentum, which is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n*   `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum)\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, this means `0 = J_f + l_X`.\n*   This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe initial total parity `P_i` must equal the final total parity `P_f`.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   `P_f` is the product of the parity of the final NN state (`P_{NN,f} = (-1)^{L_f}`), the orbital parity of particle X (`(-1)^{l_X}`), and the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P_X = -1`).\n*   `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   The conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem provides the condition: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For the final state, we are given `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nNow we test each of the proposed transitions against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓ Pass)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (✓ Pass)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (**✗ Fail**)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final NN state.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Momentum:** `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\n3.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓ Pass)\n*   This transition is **permitted** according to the given rules.\n\nThe only transition that fails to satisfy all the required conditions is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
