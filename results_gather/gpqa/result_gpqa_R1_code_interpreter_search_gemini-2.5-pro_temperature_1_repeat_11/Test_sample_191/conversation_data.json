    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and charge placement:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside a spherical cavity within the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of Electrostatics for Conductors:**\n    *   **Electric Field inside a Conductor:** In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk material of a conductor must be zero.\n    *   **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):**\n    *   To make the electric field zero inside the conductor's material, a charge must be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. According to Gauss's law, the total electric flux through this surface is $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is zero everywhere inside the conductor, the flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface ($q_{inner}$). So, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This means a charge of $q_{inner} = -q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge will distribute itself on the inner surface in a way that its field, combined with the field of the point charge $+q$, results in a zero field everywhere outside the cavity (specifically, within the conductor).\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   We have just established that a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface.\n    *   To maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else. Since charges can only reside on the surfaces of a conductor in equilibrium, this charge of $+q$ must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):**\n    *   A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The arrangement of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the positions of the cavity or the charge $+q$ within it.\n    *   The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly over the sphere, as this is the lowest energy configuration for a charge on an isolated spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The electric field at point P (outside the conductor) is the vector sum of the fields from all charges: the original charge $+q$, the inner surface charge $-q$, and the outer surface charge $+q$.\n    *   Due to the shielding effect, the net field at P from the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is zero.\n    *   Thus, the electric field at P is produced *solely* by the uniform distribution of charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$. The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by the formula for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion and choice of answer:**\n    *   The detailed information about the cavity's position ($s$), its radius ($r$), the distance of P from the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor. This information serves as a distractor.\n    *   The correct expression for the electric field magnitude at point P is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
