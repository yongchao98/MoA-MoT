    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process.\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The sequence of a *syn*-epoxidation followed by an *anti*-ring opening results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemical outcome of anti-addition to alkenes:\n    *   **An (E)-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso product.**\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Applying this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, meaning the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule for (Z)-alkenes:\n    *   **A (Z)-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** Applying this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This product consists of two different molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed on two different HPLC columns.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral column will separate the meso-diol from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Observation:** One peak for the meso-diol and one peak for the co-eluting (4R,5R) and (4S,S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will separate the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,S)-diol into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also be separated and appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Observation:** One peak for the (4R,5R)-diol, a second peak for the (4S,S)-diol, and a third peak for the meso-diol.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A. Let me re-check my final option mapping.\nStandard HPLC: 2 peaks\nChiral HPLC: 3 peaks\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\nB) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC -> Correct.\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC -> Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
