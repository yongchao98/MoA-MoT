    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information from the problem statement:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring with two groups attached).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   Six signals in total.\n        *   Two signals for aromatic protons (Ar-H).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). One is a doublet (d), and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   Two signals for methyl protons (-CH3).\n        *   No signals for methylene protons (-CH2-).\n\n2.  **Deduce the structural fragments from the spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring has the formula C6H4. The presence of only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which has a plane of symmetry, making the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 equivalent. This fragment contributes **C6H4** to the formula.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The signal patterns for the vinyl protons are very characteristic. A proton that is a doublet of quartets (dq) is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This fits a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group would be the `dq`. The other vinyl proton would be coupled only to the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment is a propenyl group. It contributes **C3H5** (`-CH=CH-CH3`) to the formula. This also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals.\n    *   **Ester Group and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The NMR shows a second -CH3 signal. This methyl group must be part of the ester functional group. There are two common possibilities: a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities contain one carbonyl carbon, two oxygen atoms, and one methyl group. This fragment contributes **C2H3O2** (`-COOCH3` or `-OCOCH3`) to the formula.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2-:** The explicit mention of no -CH2- signals confirms that our deduced fragments, which contain no -CH2- groups, are likely correct.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments and calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n    *   **Carbon atoms (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygen atoms (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) can be calculated from the formula: DBE = C + 1 - H/2.\n    For C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n\n    The DBE can also be calculated from the deduced structure:\n    *   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    The calculated DBE from the formula matches the expected DBE from the structure, confirming our result.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. Let's briefly check why the other options are incorrect.\n    *   Options A and B have 14 hydrogens. Our analysis shows 12 hydrogens. Furthermore, option B (C12H14O2) contains an additional CH2 group compared to our derived structure (C11H12O2), which is contradicted by the \"no –CH2 groups\" information.\n    *   Option D (C12H12O2) has an extra carbon compared to our derived structure, and it would be impossible to add this carbon without violating one of the other spectral constraints.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
