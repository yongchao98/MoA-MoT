    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would cause the same brightness drop as the rotational modulation of a partially spotted star.\n\n2.  **Model the Star's Brightness Variation:**\n    *   The star's brightness changes as it rotates because one hemisphere has spots and the other does not.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the observer sees the clean, unspotted hemisphere. The flux is determined by the star's effective temperature, $T_{eff}$. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux emitted per unit area is proportional to $T^4$. So, the total observed flux is proportional to the projected area of the star's disk ($A_{disk}$) times the flux from the photosphere: $F_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4$.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness ($F_{min}$):** This occurs half a rotation later, when the observer sees the spotted hemisphere face-on.\n        *   The filling factor, $f$, is 20% (or 0.2). This means 20% of the visible disk is covered by cooler spots, and the remaining 80% (or $1-f$) is the normal photosphere.\n        *   The spots have a temperature $T_{spot} = T_{eff} - 1000\\text{ K} = 6000\\text{ K} - 1000\\text{ K} = 5000\\text{ K}$.\n        *   The total flux is the sum of the flux from the photospheric part and the flux from the spotted part: $F_{min} \\propto [A_{disk}(1-f) \\cdot \\sigma T_{eff}^4] + [A_{disk} \\cdot f \\cdot \\sigma T_{spot}^4]$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Variation:**\n    *   The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux, which is $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}}$.\n    *   $\\text{Amplitude} = \\frac{\\Delta F}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n    *   Let's find the ratio $\\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$. The common terms ($A_{disk}$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out.\n        $\\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} = \\frac{(1-f)T_{eff}^4 + f T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} = (1-f) + f \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4$\n    *   Now, I can plug in the numbers:\n        *   $f = 0.2$\n        *   $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n        *   $T_{spot} = 5000$ K\n        *   $\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}} = \\frac{5000}{6000} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n    *   $\\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} = (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4 = 0.8 + 0.2 \\left(\\frac{625}{1296}\\right) \\approx 0.8 + 0.2(0.48225) \\approx 0.8 + 0.09645 = 0.89645$\n    *   $\\text{Amplitude} = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355$\n\n4.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   An exoplanet transiting a star blocks a portion of its light.\n    *   The transit depth (the drop in brightness) is given by the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    *   $\\text{Transit Depth} = \\frac{\\text{Area of planet}}{\\text{Area of star's disk}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Equate the Signals and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the exoplanet signal has the same amplitude as the spot-induced variation.\n    *   $\\text{Transit Depth} = \\text{Amplitude}$\n    *   $\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.10355$\n    *   To find the relative radius, I need to take the square root of the amplitude.\n    *   $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.32179$\n\n6.  **Final Check:**\n    *   The calculated value is approximately 0.32.\n    *   This matches option A.\n    *   The calculation seems sound. I will use a python script to verify the numerical precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20        # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# The amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots is given by:\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\n# This represents the fractional drop in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible\n# compared to when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.\namplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth for an exoplanet is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2.\n# We are looking for the case where this depth equals the spot-induced amplitude.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_spot\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spot)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spot)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would cause the same drop in brightness as the rotational modulation of a star that is 20% covered in spots on one hemisphere.\n\n1.  **Calculate the flux drop caused by the spots.**\n    The brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing the clean hemisphere and then the spotted hemisphere. The amplitude of this variation is the difference in flux between these two views, normalized by the maximum flux (from the clean hemisphere).\n\n    *   Let $F_{max}$ be the flux from the unspotted star (or the unspotted hemisphere).
