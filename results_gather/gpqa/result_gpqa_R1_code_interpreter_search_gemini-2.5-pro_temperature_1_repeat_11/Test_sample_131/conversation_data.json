    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Options:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound**\n\nFirst, let's verify the molecular formula (C10H14) for each option and predict its 1H NMR spectrum based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4 (ring) + 2 * C2H5 (ethyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Spectrum:** Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one singlet (4H). The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the -CH2- protons are coupled to the -CH3- protons. This will produce a quartet (4H total) and a triplet (6H total).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not give only singlets in the alkyl region. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated. This rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. A plane of symmetry runs horizontally and vertically through the center of the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Although adjacent, equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but are in a different chemical environment than the C1/C4 pair. This results in two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2 (ring) + 4 * CH3 (methyls) = C10H14. Formula is correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule lacks the high symmetry of the other isomers. All four methyl groups and both aromatic protons are in chemically unique environments (Point Group C1).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are non-equivalent and not coupled to each other. This should result in **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are non-equivalent. This should result in **four singlets**, each integrating to **3H** (though accidental overlap could reduce this number, as seen in databases).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), up to 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,4-, and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) produces the described spectrum.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. The combination would result in up to three signals, or two signals with a 3:1 ratio if there's overlap. This does not match the observed 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4- gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two signals (assuming they have different chemical shifts) would appear as **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** 1,2,4,5- gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4- gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combination of these gives **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5- gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5- gives two 1H singlets. This combination would result in up to three signals or two signals with a 3:1 ratio, not a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair whose combined 1H NMR spectrum matches the description is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
