    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that eliminates an anti-nutritional compound. This implies that the gene responsible for synthesizing this compound must be inactivated. In molecular biology, this is often called a \"knockout\" mutation. The most effective knockout mutations are those that prevent the formation of a functional protein.\n\n*   **Understanding Mutation Types and Their Effects:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. Usually has no effect on protein function.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a single amino acid substitution. The effect can range from negligible to complete loss of protein function, depending on the importance of the specific amino acid that was changed.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature \"stop\" codon. This causes the ribosome to stop translation, leading to a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost always non-functional.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three (e.g., deleting 1 or 2 bases). This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons, altering every amino acid downstream from the mutation. This almost always leads to a completely different and non-functional protein, often also encountering a premature stop codon in the new frame.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three (e.g., deleting 3 bases). This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This can inactivate a protein but is generally less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Each Mutant Sequence:** We will compare each mutant to the intact gene, identify the type of mutation, and predict its effect. The codons are read in groups of three starting from `ATG`.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   Translated Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The second codon change from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   **Mutation Type:** Missense mutation.\n        *   **Effect:** A full-length protein is produced, but with one amino acid changed. This protein might still be functional. This is not the most probable way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Mutation Type:** Nonsense mutation.\n        *   **Effect:** Translation will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). This will produce a very short, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This peptide is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’`\n        *   Let's compare the raw sequences:\n        *   Intact:  `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...`\n        *   Mutant3: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCA...`\n        *   This appears to be a complex mutation involving multiple base changes or a frameshift. A frameshift (caused by a single base insertion or deletion) would also likely knock out the gene. However, Mutant 2 presents a more direct and unambiguous knockout mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n        *   Comparing this to the intact sequence, it appears that the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted.\n        *   Intact:  `... CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Mutant4: `... CTC GCT --- ACT ...` (This assumes the `TAC` is a typo and the main change is the deletion)\n        *   **Mutation Type:** In-frame deletion (a deletion of 3 nucleotides).\n        *   **Effect:** The protein will be produced, but it will be missing one amino acid (Glycine). While this could potentially inactivate the protein, it is less certain to do so than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound. A nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon very early in the gene sequence is the most certain way to produce a non-functional protein. Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position, which will halt protein synthesis and result in a useless peptide. This is the most reliable way to knock out the gene's function among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
