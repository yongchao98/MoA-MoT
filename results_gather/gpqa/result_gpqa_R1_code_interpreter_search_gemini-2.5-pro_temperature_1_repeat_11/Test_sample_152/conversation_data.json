    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic α-protons (the CH₂ group is flanked by two electron-withdrawing ester groups). The strong base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electron-deficient (electrophilic) due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The electron pair from the C=C double bond shifts to the α-carbon, and the C=O π-bond shifts to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate. This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH).\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻` + `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃` → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [CH-COOCH₃]⁻`\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - [CH-COOCH₃]⁻` + EtOH → `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃` + EtO⁻\n\n4.  **Identify Product (A):** The final product is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    Let's name this structure according to the options provided. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" describes a propane backbone (C1-C2-C3) with two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1, one at C3, and a p-tolyl group at C2.\n    *   Let's draw this: `(COOCH₃)₂CH(1) - CH(2)(p-Tolyl) - CH₂(3)COOCH₃`.\n    *   This structure exactly matches the product we derived.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as solvent, followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a type of Michael Addition).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n\n3.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium ion intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** The enamine attacks the nitrile, forming a C-C bond between C2 of the cyclohexyl ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. An iminium ion is formed.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes the iminium ion, converting it to a ketone (C=O) at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring and releasing protonated piperidine.\n\n4.  **Identify Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent is the remnant of the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   The structure is 2-(1-cyanopropan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's analyze the name given in the options: **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   This name describes a butanenitrile parent chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n    *   A \"2-oxocyclohexyl\" group is attached at position 3. This means a cyclohexanone ring is attached via its C2 position.\n    *   This name perfectly describes the derived product structure. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is typically the minor product in aqueous acid.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C\n\n*   **Reactants:** C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** Michael Addition (working backwards).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is MVK, `CH₂=CH-C(O)CH₃`.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. The `CH₂=CH-` part of MVK becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-` after addition and protonation.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group in the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)CH₃`. This fragment clearly comes from MVK.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Reactant C):**\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The starting material C must therefore be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2-proton (located between the two carbonyls) of cyclohexane-1,3-dione to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK. The other option, `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`, is not the standard starting material.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of compounds corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
