    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### **1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn natural units, where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1 ($\\hbar=c=1$), the action $S$ is a dimensionless quantity. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe mass dimension of any quantity is denoted by $[Q]_M$. In natural units, mass, energy, and momentum all have a dimension of mass ($M$), while length and time have a dimension of inverse mass ($M^{-1}$).\n*   The dimension of a spacetime coordinate is $[x^\\mu]_M = M^{-1}$.\n*   The dimension of the four-dimensional volume element is $[d^4x]_M = [x^4]_M = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\n\nSince the action $S$ is dimensionless, $[S]_M = M^0$, we must have:\n$[d^4x]_M [\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^0$\n$M^{-4} [\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^0$\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is:\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^4$\n\n### **2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nTo find the mass dimensions of the fields, we examine their kinetic terms in the standard free Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion, kin} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu)\\psi$.\n    *   The derivative operator has the dimension of momentum, so $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = M^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices.\n    *   Since $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^4$, we have $[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi]_M [\\partial_\\mu]_M = M^4$.\n    *   By convention, $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$. So, $[\\psi]_M^2 \\cdot M^1 = M^4$.\n    *   This gives $[\\psi]_M^2 = M^3$, and thus the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi]_M = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM, kin} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   From $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^4$, we have $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M^2 = M^4$.\n    *   This gives the mass dimension of the field strength tensor as $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^2$.\n\n### **3. Mass Dimension of $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**\n\nThe term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ and $\\gamma_\\nu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\nTherefore, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^0$.\n\n### **4. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ from the given interaction Lagrangian:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe dimension of this interaction term must also be $M^4$, consistent with the overall Lagrangian density.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M [\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M [\\psi]_M [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4$\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^0 \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^2 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3+2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = M^{4-5} = M^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **5. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension, the theory is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. Since the dimension is negative, the theory described by this interaction is **non-renormalizable**. In such theories, loop corrections in perturbation theory lead to divergences that become progressively worse at higher orders, requiring an infinite number of counter-terms to cancel them, which strips the theory of its predictive power at high energies.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
