    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Catalyst:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, non-nucleophilic, sterically bulky base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base points to a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate Formation.** The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate. The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n        *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C1, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group) and has no α-protons.\n        *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a methyl group, and one hydrogen). It has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the deprotonation must occur at C6, forming a single possible enolate. The negative charge will be on C6, which will act as the nucleophile.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the one further from the ester group (the CH₂ group in CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting intermediate enolate is protonated during the reaction or workup (often by adding a proton source like H₂O) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   The final structure has the cyclohexanone ring with its original substituents, plus a new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the ester. The parent name is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The large cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain, attached at carbon-3.\n    *   To name the substituent ring, we number its carbons. The point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as **C1**. To give the primary functional group on the ring (the ketone) the lowest possible locant, we number clockwise, making the carbonyl carbon **C2**.\n    *   Following this numbering, the substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at **C1** (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   An oxo group at **C2** (the original C1-carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at **C3** (the original C2-substituents).\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent (α) to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Catalyst/Solvent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH, a strong base) in water (H₂O).\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Carbanion Formation.** The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion). This carbanion, `CH₃CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`, is the nucleophile.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The β-carbon is the `CH` group bonded to the methyl group.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The intermediate anion is protonated by the solvent (water) to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The reaction connects the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (`-CN`). The IUPAC suffix is **-nitrile**.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is 6 carbons long. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting with the nitrile carbon as **C1**.\n        `CH₃(C6)–CH₂(C5)–CH(NO₂)(C4)–CH(CH₃)(C3)–CH₂(C2)–C≡N(C1)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at **C3** and a nitro group at **C4**.\n    *   The full name of product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   **C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A, Correct B)**\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
