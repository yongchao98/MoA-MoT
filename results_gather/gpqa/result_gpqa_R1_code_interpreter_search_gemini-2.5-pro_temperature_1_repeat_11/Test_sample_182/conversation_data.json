    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### 1. Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is present. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n```\n      (COOH)\n        |\n    H - C1 --- C2 - H - (CHO)\n        |      |\n   H2 - C6     C3 - H\n        |      ||\n    H - C5     C4 - H\n        |\n      (-CH=CH2)\n```\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = **10 carbons (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   On the ring: 1(at C1) + 1(at C2) + 1(at C3) + 1(at C4) + 1(at C5) + 2(at C6) = 7 H\n    *   In the functional groups: 1(in COOH) + 1(in CHO) + 3(in vinyl, -CH=CH2) = 5 H\n    *   Total H = 7 + 5 = **12 hydrogens (H12)**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = **3 oxygens (O3)**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*As an aside, we can calculate the IHD of the reactant for confirmation:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis corresponds to 1 ring, 1 C=C in the ring, 1 C=C in the vinyl group, 1 C=O in the carboxyl group, and 1 C=O in the formyl group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).*\n\n### 2. Identify the Reaction and the Product\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturation. Specifically:\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nApplying these transformations to our reactant:\n*   The **-COOH** group at C1 is reduced to a **-CH3** group.\n*   The **-CHO** group at C2 is reduced to a **-CH3** group.\n*   The **C=C** double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The vinyl group (**-CH=CH2**) at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (**-CH2-CH3**).\n\nThe carbon skeleton (the C10 framework) remains, but all oxygen atoms are removed and all double bonds are saturated with hydrogen. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The exact name would be an isomer of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane, but what matters is its molecular formula.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product:\n*   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change. So, it remains **10 (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The product is a fully saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for such a compound is **CnH2n**. For n=10, the formula is **C10H20**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the molecular formula. The formula for a hydrocarbon is:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nFor the product with the formula C10H20:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD represents the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   The product molecule has **one ring** (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   It has **zero π bonds** because all double bonds have been reduced (saturated).\n\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give an IHD of 1.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. This corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the saturated molecule. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
