    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The core of the question is to compare two different mean free paths (MFP) in the same gaseous environment within a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) sample chamber.\n    *   **λ1**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other identical gas molecules. This is the standard definition of MFP in a gas.\n    *   **λ2**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron (from the TEM beam) colliding with one of the gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path Formula:**\n    The mean free path (λ) is defined as the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the gas molecules in this case).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   The projectile is a gas molecule.\n    *   The targets are other gas molecules, which are also in motion.\n    *   Because the target molecules are moving, a correction factor of √2 is introduced into the formula.\n    *   The collision cross-section (σ_gg) is related to the physical size of the molecules. If 'd' is the diameter of a gas molecule, the cross-section is πd².\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is: λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)\n\n4.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   The projectile is a high-energy electron (1000 kV = 1 MeV).\n    *   The targets are gas molecules.\n    *   The electron's speed is relativistic, extremely close to the speed of light (v ≈ 0.94c for a 1 MeV electron). The thermal velocity of the gas molecules (a few hundred m/s) is negligible in comparison. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n    *   The formula for λ2 does not have the √2 factor: λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    The comparison between λ1 and λ2 now hinges on the comparison between their respective effective cross-sections: (√2 * π * d²) for λ1 and (σ_eg) for λ2.\n\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (for λ1):** This is the kinetic cross-section, determined by the physical size of the molecule's electron cloud. It's a relatively large value. For a typical gas like N₂, it's on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (for λ2):** This is determined by the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the molecule. For a very high-energy (1 MeV) electron, the interaction is very different from a simple \"physical collision\". The electron travels so fast that the time it spends near any given gas molecule is incredibly short. This leads to a very low probability of significant interaction (scattering). In high-energy physics, it's a well-established principle that scattering cross-sections decrease significantly as the energy of the incident particle increases.\n    *   Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a 1 MeV electron on a gas molecule (σ_eg) is *much smaller* than the kinetic cross-section of that molecule (πd²).\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   We have established that σ_eg is much smaller than πd².\n    *   Let's compare the denominators of the MFP formulas:\n        *   Denominator for λ1: (√2 * n * π * d²)\n        *   Denominator for λ2: (n * σ_eg)\n    *   Since σ_eg << πd², it is certain that (n * σ_eg) << (√2 * n * π * d²).\n    *   The denominator for λ2 is much smaller than the denominator for λ1.\n    *   Because the mean free path is inversely proportional to the denominator (λ = 1 / denominator), a much smaller denominator results in a much larger mean free path.\n    *   Therefore, we can strongly conclude that **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our analysis shows λ2 is *much* larger than λ1, so it will not be bounded by a small factor like 1.22.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. This is the only option that reflects the fact that λ2 is larger than λ1. The value 1.22 is a lower bound which is easily satisfied, as our physical reasoning indicates the ratio λ2/λ1 is very large. (Even a highly simplified and incorrect model assuming σ_eg = πd² would give λ2/λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414, which satisfies this inequality).\n\n<<<D>>>"
