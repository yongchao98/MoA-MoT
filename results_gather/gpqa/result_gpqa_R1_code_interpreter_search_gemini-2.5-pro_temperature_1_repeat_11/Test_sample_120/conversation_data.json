    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n    *   **Starting Material (Substrate):** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let's break down this name:\n        *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`: This describes a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) fused to a three-membered epoxide ring. The epoxide oxygen (atom 7) forms a bridge between carbons C1 and C6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: There are methyl groups attached to carbons C1, C3, and C4 of the bicyclic system.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`: This specifies the absolute stereochemistry at the four chiral centers.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, effectively a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n2.  **Apply the Rules of the Reaction**\n    The problem statement provides two crucial rules for this type of reaction:\n    *   **Rule 1 (Regioselectivity):** The alkyl group of the reagent (in this case, methyl) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Stereoselectivity):** **Inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added. This is characteristic of an S_N2-type reaction mechanism.\n\n3.  **Identify the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom and carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group.\n    *   Carbon C6 is not substituted with a methyl group (it is bonded to a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon.\n    *   According to Rule 1, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Numbering**\n    *   The attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n    *   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (which is implied in such reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The result is a substituted cyclohexane ring with an -OH group and four methyl groups.\n    *   The -OH group is on C1 (of the original numbering).\n    *   A methyl group is also on C1 (the original one).\n    *   A new methyl group is added to C6.\n    *   The original methyl groups on C3 and C4 remain.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. So, the original C1 becomes the new C1.\n    *   To assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents, we number the ring starting from C1 and moving towards the next substituent, which is on the adjacent carbon (the original C6). Thus, the original C6 becomes the new C2.\n    *   The methyl groups are therefore located at positions:\n        *   New C1 (from the original methyl on C1).\n        *   New C2 (the newly added methyl on original C6).\n        *   New C4 (the methyl group on original C4).\n        *   New C5 (the methyl group on original C3).\n    *   The product is named as a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a \"2,2,4,5\" substitution pattern.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product (Stereoselectivity)**\n    *   We need to find the absolute configuration of the chiral centers in the product: (C1, C2, C4, C5).\n    *   The stereocenters at original C3 and C4 are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps. Their configurations are retained.\n        *   Original C3 was (3R), which becomes product C5. So, we expect **(5R)**.\n        *   Original C4 was (4R), which becomes product C4. So, we expect **(4R)**.\n    *   The key change occurs at C6, the site of attack. According to Rule 2, there is an **inversion of configuration**.\n        *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n        *   Inversion of an (S) center yields an **(R)** center.\n        *   Since the original C6 becomes the new C2, the configuration at C2 in the product must be **(2R)**.\n    *   Now let's check the available options:\n        *   A) (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n        *   D) (1R, **2R**, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Based on the inversion at the site of attack, the product must have a (2R) configuration. This points directly to option D.\n\n6.  **Final Confirmation**\n    *   The reaction is the S_N2 opening of an epoxide at the less substituted carbon (C6).\n    *   The attack at C6 inverts its stereochemistry from (6S) to (R).\n    *   This carbon becomes C2 in the final product, so the product is (2R).\n    *   The other stereocenters are expected to be (4R) and (5R), which is consistent with the options. The configuration at C1 is also determined to be (1R) in both remaining options.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
