    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use this equation.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state 'j' (N_j) to the number of atoms in a ground state 'i' (N_i) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_j, N_i are the populations of the respective energy levels.\n*   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels. This ratio is a constant for a given transition in an atom.\n*   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the \"excitation level\" as the ratio R = N_j / N_i. We can simplify the equation as:\n\nR = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)], where C = g_j / g_i is a constant.\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars**\n\nWe have two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively.\n\nFor star_1:\nR_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star_2:\nR_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**3. Using the Given Information**\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R_1 and R_2:\nC * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nThe constant C (the ratio of statistical weights) cancels out from both sides:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**4. Solving for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2**\n\nTo solve this equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\n**5. Using the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\nThe value of the Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio ΔE / k:\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nThe fact that the answer choices do not contain ΔE or k confirms that this ratio is meant to be 1.\n\n**6. The Final Equation**\n\nSubstituting the value (ΔE / k) = 1 into our derived equation:\n1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
