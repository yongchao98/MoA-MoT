    "*   **Step 1: Decipher the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal is a broad singlet integrating to one proton, appearing far downfield. This is the classic chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) with multiple different neighboring protons. It is likely adjacent to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, located at a relatively downfield position for an alkyl proton, suggests a benzylic methine (-CH-) group (a CH group attached directly to the aromatic ring).\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Let's put the fragments together: We have a -CH₂CH₃ fragment (from the 0.9 ppm triplet and part of the 1.7 ppm multiplet) and a -CH(CH₃) fragment (from the 1.4 ppm doublet and the 2.9 ppm multiplet). The benzylic carbon is the methine (2.9 ppm). This methine is attached to a methyl group (1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, we have a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** Compound X reacts with red phosphorus (red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain are stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will undergo the reduction of its carboxylic acid group.\n        *   -COOH → -CH₃\n    *   **Final Product:** The final product will be **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the product to the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
