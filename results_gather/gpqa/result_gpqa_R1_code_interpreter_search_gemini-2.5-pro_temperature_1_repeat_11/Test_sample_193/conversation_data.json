    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:**\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n    Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    This gives a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible configurations or states for the system.\n\n2.  **Identify the Energy Function:**\n    The energy of the system for a given state (S1, S2, S3) is given by the formula:\n    E = -J * [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n    where J is a constant.\n\n3.  **Define the Partition Function:**\n    The partition function, Z, is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that describes the statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. It is defined as the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE_i)`, where `E_i` is the energy of state i, and `β = 1/(kT)`.\n    Z = Σ_states exp(-βE)\n    Since multiple states can have the same energy (degeneracy), we can rewrite this as:\n    Z = Σ_levels g(E) * exp(-βE)\n    where the sum is over the distinct energy levels, and g(E) is the degeneracy (the number of states) for that energy level.\n\n4.  **Enumerate All States and Calculate Their Energies:**\n    We need to list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one. Let's denote a state by the tuple (S1, S2, S3).\n\n    *   **State 1:** (+1, +1, +1)\n        E₁ = -J * [(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J * [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   **State 2:** (+1, +1, -1)\n        E₂ = -J * [(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J * [1 - 1 - 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 3:** (+1, -1, +1)\n        E₃ = -J * [(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J * [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 4:** (-1, +1, +1)\n        E₄ = -J * [(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J * [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 5:** (+1, -1, -1)\n        E₅ = -J * [(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J * [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 6:** (-1, +1, -1)\n        E₆ = -J * [(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J * [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 7:** (-1, -1, +1)\n        E₇ = -J * [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J * [1 - 1 - 1] = -J * [-1] = J\n\n    *   **State 8:** (-1, -1, -1)\n        E₈ = -J * [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J * [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n5.  **Group States by Energy Level and Find Degeneracies:**\n    From the calculations above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n    *   **Energy Level E = -3J:**\n        This energy occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        The degeneracy for this level is g(-3J) = 2.\n\n    *   **Energy Level E = J:**\n        This energy occurs for the remaining six states.\n        The degeneracy for this level is g(J) = 6.\n\n    (Check: Total number of states = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z:**\n    Now, we can use the formula Z = Σ g(E) * exp(-βE).\n\n    Z = g(-3J) * exp(-β * (-3J)) + g(J) * exp(-β * J)\n    Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\n    Let's check the options provided:\n    A) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\n    Our result exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
