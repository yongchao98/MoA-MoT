    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product for both reactions, after workup, is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom is at position 1. This functional group is a lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center. The products are specified as the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Although the name is non-standard, it clearly describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\nLet's draw the structure and number the carbon chain:\n\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n  1    2     3     4       5\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) at C1.\n*   An **isobutyl ester** (-COO-iBu) at C5.\n\nThe molecule also has a chiral center at C3, where the ethyl group is attached. The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids under normal conditions.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This is a highly selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters as well, but much more slowly than carboxylic acids.\n\nTherefore, the two reactions will selectively reduce opposite ends of the starting molecule.\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction**: LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   Starting Material A: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   Intermediate: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (This is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Lactonization**: Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (C1) in an intramolecular esterification reaction. This closes the ring to form a six-membered lactone.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction and cyclization) occur at C1 and C5, which are not the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry at C3 is preserved. The chiral center at C3 in the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product. The configuration ((R) or (S)) does not change.\n    *   (R)-Starting Material → (R)-Lactone\n    *   (S)-Starting Material → (S)-Lactone\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: The product of this reaction is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **A must be the (R) enantiomer**.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction**: BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group at C5 untouched.\n    *   Starting Material B: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   Intermediate: `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` (This is a 5-hydroxy ester).\n\n2.  **Lactonization**: Upon acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group (-OH) from the reduced C1 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester (C5) in an intramolecular transesterification reaction. Isobutanol (iBu-OH) is eliminated, and the ring closes to form the same six-membered lactone.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: Similar to the first reaction, the reactions occur away from the chiral center (C3). The configuration is preserved. The C3 stereocenter of the starting material becomes the C4 stereocenter of the product.\n    *   (R)-Starting Material → (R)-Lactone\n    *   (S)-Starting Material → (S)-Lactone\n\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: The product of this reaction is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **B must be the (S) enantiomer**.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting Material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
