    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential**\n    The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation, it is often beneficial to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates**\n    The standard conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates is:\n    x = r * cos(θ)\n    y = r * sin(θ)\n    From these, we can derive:\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n    x^2 = r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\n    Now, substitute these expressions into the potential V:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n    Combine the terms with x^2 and y^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n4.  **Identify the Form of the Potential**\n    The potential is now in the form:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n    This is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, which means the Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent one-dimensional equations.\n\n5.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions is:\n    (-ħ^2 / 2m) * (∂^2/∂x^2 + ∂^2/∂y^2)ψ(x, y) + (V_x(x) + V_y(y))ψ(x, y) = Eψ(x, y)\n\n    Because the potential and the Laplacian operator are separable, the wavefunction can be written as a product of functions of x and y, ψ(x, y) = ψ_x(x)ψ_y(y), and the total energy E is the sum of the energies from each dimension, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n    We now solve the two independent 1D harmonic oscillator problems.\n\n6.  **Energy Spectrum for the x-direction**\n    The potential is V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2. The standard form for a 1D harmonic oscillator potential is 1/2 * k_eff * x^2.\n    Comparing these, we find the effective spring constant for the x-direction is k_x = 4k.\n    The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is:\n    ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy levels for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n    So, for the x-direction, the energy is:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m))\n    E_{n_x} = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    where n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n7.  **Energy Spectrum for the y-direction**\n    The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2.\n    The effective spring constant for the y-direction is k_y = k.\n    The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is:\n    ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m)\n    The energy for the y-direction is:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    where n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n8.  **Total Energy Spectrum**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    Now, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\n    E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m).\n    Let's compare this with the given choices:\n    A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Our result matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
