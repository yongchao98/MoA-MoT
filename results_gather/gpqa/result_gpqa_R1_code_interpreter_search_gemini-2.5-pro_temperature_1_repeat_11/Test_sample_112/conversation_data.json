    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it's typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum unequivocally confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the most likely candidate, the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺).\n    *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + (2 * 16) + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This is a perfect match and a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids. This provides strong confirmation for the presence of a -COOH group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have definitively identified two functional groups in the unknown compound: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O, which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2.\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can use the concept of the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=C double bond and one for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid. So, we expect DoU = 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement for one C=C bond and one C=O bond.\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This DoU of 1 would correspond to a molecule with only one double bond (the C=O of the carboxylic acid), meaning it would be a saturated carboxylic acid. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which prove the existence of a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence (presence of a carboxylic acid, presence of an alkene, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
