    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7. So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. A CnH2n formula can represent an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since it's saturated (doesn't react with H2), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a liquid widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / (72.066 + 12.096) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437, which is consistent with the given 14.28%. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   So, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's call the components Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This means hydrogenation of Y1 gives cyclohexane (which is true, as it's already cyclohexane).\n    *   And hydrogenation of Y2 gives cyclohexane. Since Y2 is saturated, this reaction must be an isomerization under severe hydrogenation conditions (e.g., high temperature and pressure with a Pt catalyst).\n    *   Y2 must be a saturated C6H12 isomer of cyclohexane. The most common and stable liquid isomer is **methylcyclopentane (C6H12)**. Isomerization of methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane is a known industrial process.\n    *   Therefore, **Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane}**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction from X to Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids, let's call them C and D. X has no conjugated bonds.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   A disproportionation of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons over platinum typically involves hydrogen transfer, yielding a more saturated (reduced) species and a more unsaturated (oxidized) species.\n    *   The products in mixture Y (cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane) are fully saturated. This implies they are the reduced products. The oxidized product is not mentioned as part of Y, so it must be a co-product. For C6 cyclic systems, the ultimate oxidation product is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   The overall process can be described as: Mixture X → Mixture Y + Benzene.\n    *   `Mixture {C, D} --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture {cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane} + Benzene`\n\n4.  **Identify the components of Mixture X.**\n    *   The components of X, C and D, must be the precursors to the components of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   H2 + C → cyclohexane. This means C must be an unsaturated C6 hydrocarbon with a six-membered ring skeleton (e.g., cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene).\n        *   H2 + D → cyclohexane. This means D must be an unsaturated C6 hydrocarbon whose skeleton can be hydrogenated and rearranged to a six-membered ring. The most logical precursor for methylcyclopentane (from Y) that also ultimately yields cyclohexane is an unsaturated version of methylcyclopentane (e.g., methylcyclopentene or methylcyclopentadiene).\n    *   Let C = C6Hy and D = C6Hq.\n    *   The reaction consumes C and D in a 1:1 molar ratio (since X is equimolar) and produces cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane in a 1:1 molar ratio (since Y is equimolar).\n    *   Let's write a general balanced equation for the reaction. Let `a` be the coefficient for C and D, `p` for the products in Y, and `r` for benzene.\n        `a C + a D → p cyclohexane + p methylcyclopentane + r benzene`\n    *   Substituting the formulas:\n        `a C6Hy + a C6Hq → p C6H12 + p C6H12 + r C6H6`\n    *   Balancing the carbon atoms:\n        `6a + 6a = 6p + 6p + 6r`\n        `12a = 12p + 6r`\n        `2a = 2p + r` (Equation 1)\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms:\n        `a*y + a*q = 12p + 12p + 6r`\n        `a(y + q) = 24p + 6r` (Equation 2)\n    *   Now we must determine `y` and `q`. C must be cyclohexene (C6H10) or a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The problem states no conjugated bonds, so 1,3-cyclohexadiene is out, but **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** is a possibility. D must be an unsaturated version of methylcyclopentane, like **methylcyclopentene (C6H10)**.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: **C = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and **D = methylcyclopentene (C6H10)**.\n    *   So, `y = 8` and `q = 10`.\n    *   Substitute `y` and `q` into Equation 2:\n        `a(8 + 10) = 24p + 6r`\n        `18a = 24p + 6r`\n        `3a = 4p + r` (Equation 2, simplified)\n    *   Now we solve the system of two equations:\n        1) `2a = 2p + r`\n        2) `3a = 4p + r`\n    *   From (1), `r = 2a - 2p`. Substitute this into (2):\n        `3a = 4p + (2a - 2p)`\n        `3a = 2p + 2a`\n        `a = 2p`\n    *   This gives a simple integer ratio for the coefficients `a` and `p`. If we choose `p=1`, then `a=2`.\n    *   The reaction stoichiometry is: `2 C6H8 + 2 C6H10 → 1 C6H12 + 1 C6H12 + r C6H6`. The 2:2 ratio for reactants confirms they can be an equimolar mixture. The 1:1 ratio for products confirms Y is an equimolar mixture. This model is consistent.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and methylcyclopentene (C6H10).\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Number of H atoms in methylcyclopentene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
