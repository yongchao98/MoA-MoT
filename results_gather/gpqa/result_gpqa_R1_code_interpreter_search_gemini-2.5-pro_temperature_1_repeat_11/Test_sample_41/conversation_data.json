    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem states that the albedo `A` is also the same for all three planets. Therefore, the term `T_star * R_star^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4) / sqrt(2)` is a constant for the entire system.\n    This simplifies the relationship to:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n    From this, we can express the orbital distance `a` in terms of the equilibrium temperature `T_eq`:\n    `a ∝ 1 / T_eq^2` or `a ∝ T_eq^(-2)`\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states the relationship between the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a):\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n    (Assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard assumption in such problems).\n    From this, we can express the orbital period `P` in terms of the orbital distance `a`:\n    `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n3.  **Combine the two relationships to relate Orbital Period and Equilibrium Temperature.**\n    We have two proportionalities:\n    *   `a ∝ T_eq^(-2)`\n    *   `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\n    Substitute the expression for `a` from the first relationship into the second one:\n    `P ∝ (T_eq^(-2))^(3/2)`\n    `P ∝ T_eq^(-3)`\n    This means the orbital period `P` is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature `T_eq`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets (e.g., Planet `i` and Planet `j`) can be written as:\n    `P_i / P_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the required ratio of equilibrium temperatures.**\n    We need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`. Using the formula derived in the previous step:\n    `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3`\n\n    The problem gives us the following temperature ratios:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    *   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\n    We can find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` by multiplying these two ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3`\n\n5.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    Now, we can calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods. I will use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Given ratios\nT_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3\nT_eq1_over_T_eq3 = T_eq1_over_T_eq2 * T_eq2_over_T_eq3\n\n# The relationship between period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is P ∝ T_eq^(-3)\n# So, P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\nP3_over_P1 = T_eq1_over_T_eq3 ** 3\n\nprint(f\"{P3_over_P1=}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nP3_over_P1=33.38624800000001\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio `P3 / P1` is approximately 33.39.\n\nNote: The information about the mass ratios (`M1 / M2 = 1.15` and `M2 / M3 = 1.35`) and the albedo value (`A = 0.3`) is not needed for the calculation, as the dependencies on the planet's mass are negligible and the albedo is the same for all planets, canceling out in the ratio.\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 33.4\n\nThe calculated value of ~33.4 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
