    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is the apparent angular shift of a star's position due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that distance can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Understand the \"uniform distribution of stars\" assumption.**\n    This assumption means that the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    Let's consider the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from Earth with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere (`A = 4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`).\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/dplx`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `dplx`. We can get this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/dplx = d/dplx (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -dplx / plx²`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a range (a magnitude), we can take the absolute value:\n        `|dd| = dplx / plx²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and find the final relationship.**\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (dplx / plx²) `\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) dplx`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide `dN` by `dplx`:\n    `dN/dplx = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n    Since `4`, `π`, and the star density `ρ` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `(Number of stars per unit range of parallax) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`) changes with `plx` as `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
