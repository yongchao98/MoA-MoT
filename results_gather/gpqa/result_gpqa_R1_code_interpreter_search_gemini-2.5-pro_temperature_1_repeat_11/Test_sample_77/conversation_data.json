    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Source Trajectory:** The charge moves along a path `s(t)`.\n*   **Observation Point:** The field is measured at a fixed point `r` at time `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time (`tr`):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time `tr` from a position `s(tr)`. The time delay `t - tr` is the time it takes for the light to travel from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n*   **Key Vectors and Scalars:**\n    *   `s(tr)`: Position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `v`: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t=tr`.\n    *   `d`: The vector from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n    *   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `d`, i.e., the distance the signal traveled. `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Time Condition\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting these quantities is that the distance `d` is covered by light in the time interval `t - tr`:\n`d = c(t - tr)`\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Potentials (Conceptual)\n\nThe potentials for a time-varying charge and current distribution are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `t' = t - |r - r'|/c` is the retarded time for a source element at `r'`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using Dirac delta functions:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them is a non-trivial process because the retarded time `t'` is a function of the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard result for the potentials is:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d·v/c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d·v/c)]`\n\nwhere all quantities in the square brackets (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's re-write the denominator of the standard result to match the format of the options:\n`d - d·v/c = (dc - d·v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d·v)/c)] = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d·v)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((dc - d·v)/c)] = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d·v)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d·v))`\n\nLet's compare these derived formulas with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect. These are variations of static potentials and an incorrect relation for A.\n*   B) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. A positive sign would correspond to an \"advanced\" potential, which is generally considered unphysical.\n*   **C) Correct.** The expressions for both `V(r, t)` and `A(r, t)` match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly.\n    *   `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v))`\n    *   `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d·v))`\n*   D) Incorrect. `V` is given as the static potential, which is only valid for a stationary charge. While the relationship `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>"
