    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, which we'll call **S**. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, which we'll call **S'**. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   **v**: This is the velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the observer (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. We take this velocity to be `+v`.\n    *   **u'**: This is the velocity of the light beam relative to the moving glass (frame S'). This is the speed of light *inside* the glass. By definition, the index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`. The problem specifies that we should take `c = 1`. Therefore, `n = 1 / u'`, which gives `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass's motion, `u'` is positive.\n    *   **u**: This is the velocity of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Since the velocities are relativistic (involving the speed of light), we must use the Einstein (or Lorentz) velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    Now, we substitute the values we identified into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
