    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   This is the nitration of toluene, an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The nitrating agent is the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), generated from a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will preferentially add to the positions ortho (2 and 6) or para (4) to the methyl group.\n*   While the ortho positions are statistically favored (2 positions vs. 1 para position), the para product is often the major product isolated in practice because the ortho positions are more sterically hindered. Para-nitrotoluene also has a higher melting point and lower solubility than ortho-nitrotoluene, making it easier to separate by crystallization. In the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, it's common to assume the reaction proceeds via the major, more stable, or more easily isolated para isomer.\n*   Therefore, **Product 1 is 4-nitrotoluene (or *p*-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   This is an oxidation reaction. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of a strong acid like sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n*   It will oxidize the alkyl side chain of the benzene ring. The methyl group (-CH₃) of 4-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is resistant to these oxidizing conditions.\n*   Therefore, **Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid (or *p*-nitrobenzoic acid)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   This step involves the reaction of 4-nitrobenzoic acid with acetone in a basic solution (aqueous NaOH).\n*   First, the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts with the strong base, NaOH, to form sodium 4-nitrobenzoate.\n*   The base (OH⁻) also deprotonates acetone at its α-carbon to form an enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃), which is a nucleophile and a reducing agent.\n*   Aromatic nitro compounds can undergo reductive dimerization in the presence of a reducing agent and base. The acetone enolate can act as the reducing agent, reducing the nitro group. Two molecules of 4-nitrobenzoic acid couple together.\n*   The reaction proceeds via an intermediate azoxy compound (R-N=N⁺(O⁻)-R) and then to the more stable, final azo compound (R-N=N-R).\n*   Thus, two molecules of 4-nitrobenzoic acid are reductively coupled to form 4,4'-azodibenzoic acid.\n*   **Product 3 is (E)-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid**. The trans (E) isomer is significantly more stable than the cis (Z) isomer and is the expected product.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n\n*   Product 3 is (E)-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid. Its structure is:\n    HOOC - [Benzene Ring] - N=N - [Benzene Ring] - COOH\n*   Let's analyze the symmetry elements of the stable, trans (E) conformation, which is expected to be planar to maximize pi-conjugation.\n\n     ![Structure of (E) -4,4'-azodibenzoic acid](https://i.imgur.com/uG9kR51.png)\n\n*   **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n*   **Principal Axis of Rotation (C₂):** There is a C₂ axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the N=N bond. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is a center of inversion at the midpoint of the N=N bond. Inverting any point (x, y, z) through the origin to (-x, -y, -z) maps the molecule onto itself.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σh):** The plane containing the entire molecule is a plane of symmetry. This plane is perpendicular (horizontal) to the C₂ principal axis.\n\n*   A point group that contains the symmetry elements E, C₂, i, and σh is the **C₂h** point group.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) C₃: Requires a 3-fold axis of rotation. The molecule does not possess this.\nB) Cₛ: Requires only a single plane of symmetry. The molecule has more symmetry than this.\nC) C₂h: Requires a C₂ axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and an inversion center. This matches our analysis.\nD) D₂h: Requires three perpendicular C₂ axes. The molecule only has one.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is C₂h.\n\n<<<C>>>"
