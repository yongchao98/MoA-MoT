    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector.\n\n**1. Define the Operators**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThis operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For the vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This occurs when $\\phi=0$.\n\nSo, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n**3. Construct the Operator Along the Direction** $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n\nSubstituting the matrix forms:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right]$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)\\sin\\theta + (1)\\cos\\theta & (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta \\\\ (1)\\sin\\theta + (0)\\cos\\theta & (0)\\sin\\theta + (-1)\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the constant $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector can be written by choosing a convenient value for $a$, for instance $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\nIf $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nTo normalize the eigenvector, we need to ensure its norm (length) is 1. The squared norm is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2$.\n$|a|^2 + |b|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\nThe eigenvector is already normalized.\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect units.\nB) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect form, uses full angle $\\theta$ and includes a phase factor not present for this specific case.\nC) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect units and coefficients.\nD) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - This matches our derived result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
