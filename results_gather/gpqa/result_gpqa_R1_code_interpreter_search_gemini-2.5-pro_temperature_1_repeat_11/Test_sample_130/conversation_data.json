    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C NMR.\n        *   A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃). Due to its C₂ᵥ symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are equivalent, leading to a single peak in the ¹H NMR. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of olefinic protons deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n        *   Similarly, there are only two types of carbon atoms: the two equivalent olefinic carbons and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons. This leads to two peaks in the ¹³C NMR. The chemical shifts of ~137 ppm (olefinic C=C) and ~165 ppm (carbonyl C=O) are consistent with this structure.\n        *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n    *   **The Diene:** The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene with the formula C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct. The reaction yields two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   The molecular formula of the products will be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction typically follows the \"endo rule,\" where the major product is the *endo* adduct due to favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   However, the endo rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this case, the diene has four methyl groups, including two at the reacting carbons (C1 and C4). In the *endo* transition state, the anhydride molecule tucks \"under\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with the methyl groups at C1 and C4. The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride is further away from these methyl groups, is less sterically hindered.\n    *   Therefore, for this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *endo* adduct**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and NOESY Spectra**\n    *   **NOESY** (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major (*exo*) product but far apart in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   Let's analyze the proton signals and their positions in the two isomers. The products have a plane of symmetry, leading to four main types of proton signals in the ¹H NMR:\n        *   **H_alpha (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm):** The two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **Me_vinyl (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm):** The two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Me_bridgehead (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm):** The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons.\n        *   **H_bridge (2H, complex signal):** The two diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ bridge (not relevant for the options provided).\n\n    *   **Structure of the Major (*exo*) Product:**\n        *   In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (away from) the CH₂ bridge. This orients the **H_alpha** protons towards the C=C double bond.\n        *   This geometry brings the **H_alpha** protons very close to the **Me_vinyl** groups.\n        *   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between **H_alpha** and **Me_vinyl**.\n\n    *   **Structure of the Minor (*endo*) Product:**\n        *   In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the CH₂ bridge. This orients the **H_alpha** protons away from the C=C double bond.\n        *   In this geometry, the **H_alpha** protons and the **Me_vinyl** groups are far apart.\n        *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between **H_alpha** and **Me_vinyl** will be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent/weak in the minor product.\n    *   Our analysis shows that the cross-peak between **H_alpha** (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet) fits this description perfectly.\n    *   This corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option A.\n\nFinal Answer Selection:\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_alpha)**: This matches our conclusion.\n*   B), C), D): These describe interactions that are either weak, absent, or not unique to the major product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
