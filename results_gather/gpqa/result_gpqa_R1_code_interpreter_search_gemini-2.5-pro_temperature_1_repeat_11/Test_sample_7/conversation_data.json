    "Here is my reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the functional relationship between three genes (G1, G2, G3) based on the disease resistance levels of their knockout mutants. Key terms to consider are transcription factor, epistasis, gene redundancy, and pleiotropy.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Data Systematically:**\n    *   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n    *   **Single mutant `g2`:** 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype. The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance. This suggests G2 plays a critical, essential role in the pathway.\n    *   **Single mutants `g1` and `g3`:** `g1` has 75% resistance, and `g3` has 50% resistance. Both genes contribute to resistance, but neither is absolutely essential on its own. G3 appears to have a larger individual contribution than G1.\n    *   **Double mutants with `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`):** Both have 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant.\n\n3.  **Interpret the `g2` Interactions (Epistasis):**\n    *   The term **epistasis** describes a situation where the effect of one gene masks the effect of another gene.\n    *   In the `g1g2` double mutant, the phenotype is 0% resistance. This is the `g2` phenotype, not the `g1` phenotype (75%). Therefore, the `g2` mutation is **epistatic** to the `g1` mutation (it masks its effect).\n    *   Similarly, in the `g2g3` double mutant, the phenotype is 0% resistance (the `g2` phenotype), masking the `g3` phenotype (50%). So, `g2` is also epistatic to `g3`.\n    *   When one gene is epistatic to others in a pathway, it usually means it acts **upstream**. Given the information that one gene is a **transcription factor** (a master regulator that turns other genes on), the most logical conclusion is that G2 is this transcription factor. If G2 is required to activate G1 and G3, its absence would shut down the entire pathway, resulting in 0% resistance regardless of whether G1 or G3 are functional.\n    *   This eliminates option C, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n4.  **Interpret the `g1` and `g3` Interaction:**\n    *   **Single mutants:** `g1` causes a 25% loss of resistance (100% -> 75%). `g3` causes a 50% loss of resistance (100% -> 50%).\n    *   **Double mutant `g1g3`:** 10% resistance. This is a 90% loss of resistance.\n    *   If the genes acted in a simple additive way, we might expect a combined loss of 25% + 50% = 75%, leading to 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the observed loss (90%) is much greater than the sum of the individual losses (75%). This phenomenon, where the double mutant has a much more severe phenotype than expected, is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   Synergistic interactions often point to **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 perform similar or parallel functions in the resistance pathway. While one can partially compensate for the loss of the other, losing both is catastrophic to the system.\n    *   Let's evaluate the options based on this interaction:\n        *   Option A suggests they have the \"same promoter,\" which is inconsistent with having separate knockouts.\n        *   Option B suggests \"gene redundancy,\" which perfectly fits our analysis of the synergistic effect.\n        *   Options C and D suggest \"pleiotropy.\" Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits. We are only measuring one trait (resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy. Furthermore, it doesn't describe the *interaction* between G1 and G3.\n    *   Therefore, the statement \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is the most accurate description. This strongly favors Option B.\n\n5.  **Final Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. \"Same promoter\" is unlikely, and G3 is not epistatic to G1 (the double mutant phenotype of 10% is different from the g3 phenotype of 50%).\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This option contains two strongly supported conclusions: \"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.\" The third clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is technically incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). However, compared to the other options, this one is by far the most accurate. The incorrect epistasis claim is likely an error in the question's construction.\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. G2, not G1, is the transcription factor.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** Incorrect. \"Pleiotropy\" is not the correct term for the G1-G3 interaction; \"redundancy\" is.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Option B provides the best explanation for the experimental data, correctly identifying G2's role as an upstream transcription factor and the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy, despite an error in its final clause.\n\n<<<B>>>"
