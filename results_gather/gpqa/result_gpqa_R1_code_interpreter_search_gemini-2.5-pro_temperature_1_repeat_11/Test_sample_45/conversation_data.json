    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactant and the reaction.**\n    The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it is a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3, and the chiral center is at the C3 position.\n    The reagent is Grubbs catalyst, which catalyzes olefin metathesis. Since there is only one type of alkene reactant, this will be a self-metathesis reaction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the products of self-metathesis.**\n    The general equation for the self-metathesis of a terminal alkene (R'-CH=CH2) is:\n    2 R'-CH=CH2  <=>  R'-CH=CH-R' + CH2=CH2 (ethene)\n    In our case, the R' group is the sec-butyl group, -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.\n    The reaction is:\n    2 CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3  <=>  CH3CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 + CH2=CH2\n    The question asks to exclude ethene, so we need to focus on the product 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the reaction and products.**\n    The starting material is a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's denote them as R-alkene and S-alkene.\n    The reaction involves the coupling of two alkene molecules. Three combinations are possible:\n    1.  R-alkene + R-alkene (homo-coupling)\n    2.  S-alkene + S-alkene (homo-coupling)\n    3.  R-alkene + S-alkene (cross-coupling)\n\n    The product, 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene, has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a new double bond at C4, which can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry. Let's analyze the stereoisomers formed from each combination.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the products from each coupling reaction.**\n\n    1.  **R-alkene + R-alkene:**\n        This reaction combines two (R)-configured groups. The product will be (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n        Due to the new double bond, this can exist as two geometric isomers (diastereomers):\n        *   (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n        *   (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n        This gives **2** possible products.\n\n    2.  **S-alkene + S-alkene:**\n        This reaction combines two (S)-configured groups. The product will be (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n        Again, this can exist as two geometric isomers:\n        *   (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n        *   (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n        Note that (E)-(3S, 6S) is the enantiomer of (E)-(3R, 6R), and (Z)-(3S, 6S) is the enantiomer of (Z)-(3R, 6R). These are distinct compounds from the first two.\n        This gives another **2** possible products.\n\n    3.  **R-alkene + S-alkene:**\n        This reaction combines one (R)-configured group and one (S)-configured group. The product will be (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n        Because the two substituents on the double bond are enantiomeric, the resulting molecule possesses internal symmetry.\n        *   When the geometry is E (trans), the molecule has a center of inversion, making it an achiral meso compound: (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n        *   When the geometry is Z (cis), the molecule has a plane of symmetry, also making it an achiral meso compound: (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene.\n        These two meso compounds are diastereomers of each other and also diastereomers of the chiral products from the homo-couplings.\n        This gives another **2** possible products.\n\n*   **Step 5: Sum the total number of unique products.**\n    From the three possible reaction pairings, we have identified six distinct stereoisomers that can be formed:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers with E-geometry: (E)-(3R,6R) and (E)-(3S,6S)\n    *   A pair of enantiomers with Z-geometry: (Z)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3S,6S)\n    *   Two diastereomeric meso compounds: (E)-(3R,6S) and (Z)-(3R,6S)\n\n    Total number of possible products = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
