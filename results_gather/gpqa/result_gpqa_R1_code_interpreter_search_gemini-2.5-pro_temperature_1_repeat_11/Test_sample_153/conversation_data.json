    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The intensity of this M+2 peak is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that strongly suggests the presence of an O-H group involved in extensive hydrogen bonding. Specifically, this wide range is the hallmark of a **carboxylic acid** (R-COOH).\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region (C=O). Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This rules out options C (phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H) and D (an aldehyde, which would have a different O-H profile if phenolic, and lacks the very broad carboxylic acid O-H).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0-8.5 ppm):** There are two distinct signals in this region, which is typical for protons attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to two equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. The doublet splitting indicates they are adjacent to (coupled with) one neighboring proton.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to another set of two equivalent protons. They are also split into a doublet.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, for a total of 4 aromatic protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents create a plane of symmetry, making the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted ring. It would not produce a simple two-doublet pattern in the ¹H NMR. Instead, it would show a more complex pattern of four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule fits all the data perfectly.\n    *   **MS:** Molecular weight is 156.5 g/mol and it contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR spectrum.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a carboxylic acid, explaining the 11.0 ppm signal. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, which would produce two doublets, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded (further downfield, 8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR data (not a carboxylic acid).\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR data (not a carboxylic acid, and would have a different NMR spectrum for the aldehyde and aromatic protons).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
