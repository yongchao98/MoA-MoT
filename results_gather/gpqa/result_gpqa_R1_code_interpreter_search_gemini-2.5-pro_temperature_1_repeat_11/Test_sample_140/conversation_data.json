    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n    *   This reaction condition (an aryl halide with a very strong base) is characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (H⁺) or a deuteron (D⁺) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n        *   **Position C6:** This carbon has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The base can abstract a proton from either position, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton from C6.\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron from C2. (Note: This is slower than removing H due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting electron pair forms a triple bond between C1 and C2, expelling the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium atom is removed, so the resulting benzyne is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C6. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C1. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the D at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   So, Pathway A yields **two** distinct deuterated products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (via standard benzyne):**\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ attacks the non-deuterated benzyne at C1 or C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C2. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C2. The product is **aniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C2. A carbanion forms at C1. Protonation by NH₃ adds an H to C1. The product is also **aniline**.\n        *   So, Pathway B yields only **one** non-deuterated product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Combining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we find three unique organic products:\n        1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
