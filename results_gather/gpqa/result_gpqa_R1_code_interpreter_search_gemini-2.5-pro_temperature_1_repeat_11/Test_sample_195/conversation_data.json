    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    In a conservative system, the total energy remains constant. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential field $U(x)$, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and its potential energy ($U(x)$).\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\text{constant}$\n    Here, $m$ is the rest mass of the oscillator, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy of the Harmonic Oscillator:**\n    The problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ associated with this force is given by:\n    $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at two key points in the oscillation:**\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude A).**\n        At the point of maximum displacement, $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest.\n        *   Speed, $v = 0$.\n        *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   Potential energy, $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = 1 \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position (x=0).**\n        At the equilibrium position, $x=0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   Speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   Potential energy, $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max:**\n    According to the conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be the same.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Then, we square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C.\n\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n<<<C>>>"
