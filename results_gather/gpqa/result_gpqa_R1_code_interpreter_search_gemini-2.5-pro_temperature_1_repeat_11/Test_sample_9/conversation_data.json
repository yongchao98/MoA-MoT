    "*   **Analysis of the options:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This sets our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given as approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A fundamental principle of planetary structure is that for objects with the same composition, a more massive object will have stronger gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the material more, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, this \"super-Earth\" will be significantly denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), a less massive planet will have weaker gravity. This results in less compression of its material, leading to a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n*   **Quantitative Estimation:**\n    We can use a simplified mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is approximately R ∝ M^0.27, where R is the radius and M is the mass. Density (ρ) is mass divided by volume (V), and V ∝ R³.\n    *   ρ = M/V ∝ M/R³\n    *   Substituting the mass-radius relationship: ρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M / M^0.81 = M^0.19.\n    *   This shows that density increases with mass for planets of the same composition.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   Planet (a): Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (b): Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (c): Mass is 5 M_Earth. Its density will be proportional to 5^0.19 ≈ 1.36 times Earth's density. So, ρ_c ≈ 1.36 * 5.51 ≈ 7.5 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (d): Mass is 0.5 M_Earth. Its density will be proportional to 0.5^0.19 ≈ 0.87 times Earth's density. So, ρ_d ≈ 0.87 * 5.51 ≈ 4.8 g/cm³.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the densities:\n    *   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_c ≈ 7.5 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_d ≈ 4.8 g/cm³\n\n    The planet in option (c) has the highest density due to gravitational self-compression.\n\n<<<A>>>"
