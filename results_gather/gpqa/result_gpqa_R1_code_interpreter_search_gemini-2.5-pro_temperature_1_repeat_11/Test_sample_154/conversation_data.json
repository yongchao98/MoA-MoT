    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the given quantities.**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The operator $P_z$ is given by the matrix $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, which means $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis. The eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: $\\hbar, 0, -\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Recall the definition of uncertainty.**\n    The uncertainty $\\Delta A$ of an operator $A$ is given by the formula:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n    So, for $P_z$, we have:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    The bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$ is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $\\langle \\psi | = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    First, we calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    The expectation value is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    First, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\n    Now we use the formula for the uncertainty squared:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n    The uncertainty is the square root of this value:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nI will use a python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Let hbar be a symbolic variable, but for calculation we can set it to 1\n# and reintroduce it at the end.\nhbar = 1.0\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# Define the operator Pz\nPz = np.array([[hbar, 0, 0],\n               [0, 0, 0],\n               [0, 0, -hbar]])\n\n# Conjugate transpose of psi\npsi_dagger = psi.T.conj()\n\n# Expectation value of Pz\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Operator Pz^2\nPz2 = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Expectation value of Pz^2\nexp_Pz2 = (psi_dagger @ Pz2 @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Variance of Pz ((Delta Pz)^2)\nvar_Pz = exp_Pz2 - exp_Pz**2\n\n# Uncertainty of Pz (Delta Pz)\ndelta_Pz = np.sqrt(var_Pz)\n\n# The result is delta_Pz * hbar.
