    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to identify which stars from a given list can be observed by two specific instruments: ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory.\n\nA star must meet two criteria to be observable by *both* instruments:\n1.  **Positional Criterion:** It must be visible from both observatory locations. Since the pointing limits are disregarded, this simplifies to the star's declination (DEC) being within the observable range for both sites.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion:** It must be bright enough for both spectrographs. The brightness limit is given as an apparent V magnitude (m_V).\n    *   ESPRESSO: m_V < 17 mag\n    *   HIRES: m_V < 16 mag\n    *   Therefore, to be seen by *both*, a star must satisfy the stricter limit: **m_V < 16 mag**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Positional Criterion (Observability)**\n\nFirst, I need the latitudes of the two observatories to determine their sky coverage.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** The provided Wikipedia link states its coordinates are 24°37′38″S. This is a latitude of approximately **-24.6°**.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** The provided Wikipedia link states its coordinates are 19°49′34″N. This is a latitude of approximately **+19.8°**.\n\nA star with declination `δ` is observable from a latitude `φ` if it rises above the horizon. The condition for this is `|φ - δ| < 90°`.\n\n*   **For Paranal (φ ≈ -24.6°):**\n    *   The observable declination range is `-24.6° - 90° < δ < -24.6° + 90°`.\n    *   This gives `-114.6° < δ < 65.4°`. Since declination is physically limited to [-90°, +90°], the effective range for Paranal is **-90° ≤ δ < 65.4°**.\n\n*   **For Keck (φ ≈ +19.8°):**\n    *   The observable declination range is `19.8° - 90° < δ < 19.8° + 90°`.\n    *   This gives `-70.2° < δ < 109.8°`. The effective range for Keck is **-70.2° < δ ≤ +90°**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the intersection of these two ranges.\n*   Intersection: `max(-90°, -70.2°) < δ < min(65.4°, 90°)`.\n*   The required declination range is **-70.2° < δ < 65.4°**.\n\nNow, let's check each star's declination:\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the range (since -75° < -70.2°). **Ineligible.**\n*   **Star2:** DEC = +55°. This is inside the range. **Eligible.**\n*   **Star3:** DEC = +48°. This is inside the range. **Eligible.**\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48°. This is inside the range. **Eligible.**\n*   **Star5:** DEC = +60°. This is inside the range. **Eligible.**\n\nThis first step eliminates Star1. We now only need to evaluate Stars 2, 3, 4, and 5 based on their brightness.\n\n**3. Analyze the Brightness Criterion (m_V < 16)**\n\nFor each eligible star, I need to find its apparent V magnitude (m_V) and check if it's less than 16. I'll use the distance modulus formula when necessary: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc), and `A_V` is the extinction. The problem states `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   The apparent V magnitude is given directly: `m_V = 16.5 mag`.\n    *   Check: Is `16.5 < 16`? No.\n    *   **Ineligible.**\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   The apparent V magnitude is given directly: `m_V = 15.5 mag`. The provided extinction information is extraneous if we assume the given apparent magnitude is the final, observed value.\n    *   Check: Is `15.5 < 16`? Yes.\n    *   **Eligible.**\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   `M_V` = 15.5 mag, `d` = 10 pc, `E(B-V)` = 0.4 mag.\n    *   First, calculate extinction: `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag`.\n    *   Next, calculate apparent magnitude:\n        `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n        `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n        `m_V = 15.5 + 5*(1) - 5 + 1.24`\n        `m_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`.\n    *   Check: Is `16.74 < 16`? No.\n    *   **Ineligible.**\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   `M_V` = 16.5 mag, `d` = 5 pc. No extinction is mentioned, so `A_V = 0`.\n    *   Calculate apparent magnitude:\n        `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n        `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0`\n        (Using `log10(5) ≈ 0.699`)\n        `m_V ≈ 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5`\n        `m_V ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5`\n        `m_V ≈ 14.995 mag`.\n    *   Check: Is `14.995 < 16`? Yes.\n    *   **Eligible.**\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Star1: Fails position check.\n*   Star2: Fails brightness check.\n*   **Star3: Passes both position and brightness checks.**\n*   Star4: Fails brightness check.\n*   **Star5: Passes both position and brightness checks.**\n\nThe two stars that can be detected by both instruments are Star3 and Star5. This corresponds to option A.\n\nTo be certain, I will use a Python script to perform all calculations systematically.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_observability():\n    # Observatory latitudes\n    lat_paranal = -24.6272  # Paranal Observatory, Chile\n    lat_keck = 19.8261     # W.

    "To determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Positional Observability:** The star must be visible from the locations of both observatories.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to be detected by both instruments.\n\n### 1. Positional Observability\n\nA star is visible from an observatory if its declination (DEC) falls within the observatory's observable range. We can determine this range from the latitude of each observatory.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South (-24.6°). A star at declination `δ` is visible if `-90° < δ < -24.6° + 90°`, which simplifies to **-90° < δ < +65.4°**.\n*   **Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located at a latitude of approximately 19.8° North (+19.8°). A star at declination `δ` is visible if `19.8° - 90° < δ < +90°`, which simplifies to **-70.2° < δ < +90°**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the intersection of these two ranges.\n*   The common observable range is **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\nLet's check the declination of each star:\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the common range.\n*   **Star2:** DEC = +55°. This is inside the common range.\n*   **Star3:** DEC = +48°. This is inside the common range.\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48°. This is inside the common range.\n*   **Star5:** DEC = +60°. This is inside the common range.\n\nBased on position alone, Star1 is eliminated.\n\n### 2. Brightness\n\nThe brightness limits are given as apparent V magnitudes (m_V):\n*   ESPRESSO: m_V < 17 mag\n*   HIRES: m_V < 16 mag\n\nTo be observed by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is **m_V < 16 mag**.\n\nNow, let's find the apparent V magnitude for the remaining stars (Star2, Star3, Star4, and Star5). For stars where the apparent magnitude isn't given directly, we use the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `M_V` is the absolute V magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc), and `A_V` is the visual extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star2:** The apparent magnitude is given as **m_V = 16.5 mag**. This is not brighter than 16 mag. So, Star2 is too faint.\n\n*   **Star3:** The apparent magnitude is given as **m_V = 15.5 mag**. This is brighter than 16 mag. So, Star3 is observable.\n\n*   **Star4:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**. This is not brighter than 16 mag. So, Star4 is too faint.\n\n*   **Star5:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   A_V = 0 (no extinction is mentioned)\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**. This is brighter than 16 mag. So, Star5 is observable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   Star1: Fails the position check.\n*   Star2: Fails the brightness check.\n*   **Star3: Passes both the position and brightness checks.**\n*   Star4: Fails the brightness check.\n*   **Star5: Passes both the position and brightness checks.**\n\nTherefore, the stars that can be detected by both instruments are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
