    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the reaction and products**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The decomposition products are entirely gaseous. These gases are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) tests for acidic gases like CO₂. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no such acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper reacts with oxidizing agents. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO), meaning the mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from molecular oxygen (O₂) or another oxygen-containing oxidizing gas (like N₂O).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents used (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu). Given that the original salts are likely nitrogen compounds, the most probable identity for Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture**\n\nBased on the products, we can determine the total moles of each element (H, N, O) in the original 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂, all nitrogen ends up as this final gas.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water produced and the oxygen that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = n(O in H₂O) + n(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\n**3. Verify the composition and determine the empirical formula**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming that salts A and B are composed only of N, H, and O.\n\nNow, we find the molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar (equal moles of A and B), this ratio N₄H₈O₅ represents the combined chemical formula of one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to find two common salts made of N, H, and O that, when added together, give the formula N₄H₈O₅. The most common salts fitting this description are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n\nLet's test the most likely candidates:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived combined formula:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₍₂₊₂₎H₍₄₊₄₎O₍₂₊₃₎ = N₄H₈O₅\n\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. We can also verify this with the total mass. The molar mass of the N₄H₈O₅ unit is (4×14) + (8×1) + (5×16) = 56 + 8 + 80 = 144 g/mol. The total moles of this unit in the mixture is 7.20 g / 144 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This means we have 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B, consistent with our deductions from the product analysis.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nTo be certain, let's verify the calculations using a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Molar masses (approximate for verification)\nH = 1.0\nN = 14.0\nO = 16.0\n\n# Initial data\nmass_mixture = 7.20\nmass_H2O = 3.60\nmass_O_in_CuO = 0.80\nvol_gas_C_STP = 2.24\n\n# Moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / (2*H + O)\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_O_in_CuO / O\nmoles_gas_C = vol_gas_C_STP / 22.4\n\n# Moles of elements in the original mixture\nmoles_H = 2 * moles_H2O\nmoles_N = 2 * moles_gas_C # Assuming gas C is N2\nmoles_O = moles_H2O + moles_O_atoms\n\n# Verify total mass\ncalculated_mass = moles_H * H + moles_N * N + moles_O * O\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass: {calculated_mass:.2f} g (Original: {mass_mixture} g)\")\n\n# Identify salts\n# Combined formula from molar ratios N:H:O = 0.2:0.4:0.25 -> N4H8O5\n# Salt A: NH4NO2 -> N2H4O2\n# Salt B: NH4NO3 -> N2H4O3\n# Check: N2H4O2 + N2H4O3 = N4H8O5.

    "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of the experimental data:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the formation of water (H₂O).\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   From this, we can find the moles of hydrogen atoms in the original mixture: n(H) = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a test for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the mass did not change, no such gases were produced. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the reaction of an oxidizing gas with copper to form CuO. The mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen could come from gases like O₂ or N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of an inert gas C remains at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given that the salts are likely nitrogen-based (a common component of salts that decompose into gases), this inert gas is most probably nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × n(N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**2. Determining the elemental composition of the initial mixture:**\n\nLet's find the total moles and mass of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** n(H) = 0.40 mol. Mass = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** n(N) = 0.20 mol. Mass = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** The total oxygen is the sum of the oxygen in the water and the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   n(O) = n(O in H₂O) + n(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Total Mass Check:** 0.40 g (H) + 2.80 g (N) + 4.00 g (O) = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of N, H, and O.\n\n**3. Identifying Salts A and B:**\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n\nThe combined formula of (Salt A + Salt B) is N₄H₈O₅. Since the mixture is equimolar, we need to find two salts whose formulas sum to this. The most common salts containing N, H, and O are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃\n\nLet's sum the formulas: (N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\nThus, salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite** and **ammonium nitrate**.\n\n**4. Calculating the total number of atoms:**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
