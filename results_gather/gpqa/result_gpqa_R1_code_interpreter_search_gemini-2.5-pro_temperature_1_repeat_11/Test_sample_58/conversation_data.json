    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.05 moles**\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl dissociates completely: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.08 moles**\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Note that each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 moles\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.09 moles = **0.18 moles**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all the available acid. It's best to let it react with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, and then with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Reaction between strong acid and strong base.**\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.08 moles\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 moles\n    *   The limiting reactant is H⁺. All 0.08 moles of H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 moles - 0.08 moles = **0.10 moles**\n\n*   **Step 2b: Reaction between remaining strong base and weak acid.**\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 moles\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available (from Step 2a) = 0.10 moles\n    *   The limiting reactant is CH₃COOH. All 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining (in excess) = 0.10 moles - 0.05 moles = **0.05 moles**\n    *   Moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) produced = **0.05 moles**\n\n**3. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains:\n*   Excess strong base (OH⁻): **0.05 moles**\n*   Conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻): 0.05 moles\n*   Spectator ions (Cl⁻, Ba²⁺) and water.\n\nThe pH of the final solution will be dominated by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻), as its presence significantly suppresses the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). Therefore, we can calculate the pH based on the concentration of the excess OH⁻.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300 * 2\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization reactions\n# Strong acid - strong base\nmoles_oh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\n# Remaining strong base - weak acid\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 3: Calculate pH\n# Total volume\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n# Concentration of excess OH-\nconc_oh = moles_oh_excess / total_volume_L\n# pOH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh)\n# pH\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f'{pH:.2f}')\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Calculate the initial number of moles for all acidic and basic species.\n2.  Simulate the neutralization reactions to determine which species is in excess.\n3.  Calculate the final concentration of the excess species in the total volume.\n4.  Calculate the pH based on the final concentration.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Initial Moles**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.05 moles**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.08 moles**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely, yielding two moles of OH⁻ per mole of Ba(OH)₂ (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 moles\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 moles = **0.18 moles**\n\n**Step 2: Neutralization Reaction**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acids. We can sum the total moles of acid to see what is in excess.\n*   Total moles of acid (H⁺ from HCl + CH₃COOH) = 0.08 moles + 0.05 moles = **0.13 moles**\n*   Total moles of base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂) = **0.18 moles**\n\nSince moles of base > moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.18 moles - 0.13 moles = **0.05 moles**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Final Concentration**\n\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the final solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\nNow, calculate the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions.\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate pH**\n\nWith the concentration of OH⁻, we can first calculate the pOH.\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n*   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, we can find the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the excess strong base, making the solution highly alkaline.\n\n<<<C>>>"
