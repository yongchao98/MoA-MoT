    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay process of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means we need to find an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ such that both transitions are allowed by the E1 selection rules.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**2. Identify the Intermediate State(s)**\n\nThe decay process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   Applying selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n        *   Since it's a decay, $n' < 3$. The decay will preferentially happen to the closest available energy level, which is $n'=2$. (A transition to $n'=1$ with $l'=1$ is impossible, as the $n=1$ shell only has $l=0$).\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle = |2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Let's check if this transition is allowed from our identified intermediate states.\n    *   Initial state: $n_i=2, l_i=1, m_i=m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    *   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   Applying selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0 - m'$. This is allowed since $m'$ can be $0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   This confirms that all three states $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are valid intermediate states. The routes proposed in all options are physically possible.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom follows a specific route. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n*   **Probability of the First Step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    *   The probability of the atom decaying into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by its transition rate divided by the total transition rate to all possible states. This is the branching ratio.\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element $|\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | \\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the degenerate magnetic sublevels of the final state.\n    *   The final states are the three degenerate levels $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    *   Since there are three equally likely outcomes for the first transition, the probability (branching ratio) for the atom to transition into any one of them is $1/3$.\n    *   So,\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n*   **Probability of the Second Step: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, we need to find the probability of its decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Let's consider all possible E1 decay channels from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l''=0$ or $l''=2$.\n        *   For $l''=2$ (a d-state), the principal quantum number $n''$ must be at least 3. Since this would be an excitation ($n''>2$), it cannot happen via spontaneous emission.\n        *   For $l''=0$ (an s-state), the only possible state with $n''<2$ is the $n''=1$ state, which is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Therefore, the *only* allowed E1 decay channel from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   This means that if the atom reaches the intermediate level, it is guaranteed to decay to the final state. The probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Probability for the Specified Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\nLet's evaluate the route given in option D: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Probability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n*   Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The calculated probability is $1/3$. Incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The calculated probability is $1/3$. Incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The calculated probability is $1/3$. Incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid and the calculated probability matches. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
