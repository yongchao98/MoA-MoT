    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH₂(C=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This stereocenter will not be affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. Since there is already a stereocenter at C5, the two faces are diastereotopic. This means the attack from the two sides will lead to the formation of two different products, which are diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Reaction I produces a mixture of two compounds that are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃(C=O)CH₂(C=O)CH₃.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The product molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the resulting mixture of stereoisomers must be optically inactive overall. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction produces them in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The molecule has equivalent stereocenters (C2 and C4). Therefore, the (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound (it is superimposable on the (2R, 4S) isomer).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Reaction II produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), but it cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will be separated, producing a **second peak**.\n    *   So, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks** on a normal-phase column.\n*   **Combined Analysis:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular weights, polarities, and structures. Therefore, it is expected that all separable groups will have unique retention times (no accidental co-elution).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, as they will interact differently with the chiral environment.\n*   We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our combined mixture:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of these unique stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers), and assuming no accidental overlap between the structurally different molecules from the two reactions, each compound will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
