    "SMEFT, or the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are built from the Standard Model fields and their derivatives. The construction of SMEFT relies on a set of fundamental assumptions about the nature of the underlying theory. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All local quantum field theories, including the Standard Model and by extension SMEFT, are constructed to be Lorentz invariant. This means the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. The operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry**: This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations as well as spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a cornerstone of our current understanding of particle physics and is a foundational assumption in the construction of SMEFT.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry**: This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established experimentally that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably through the complex phase in the CKM matrix of the weak interaction. Since the Standard Model, which is the dimension-four part of SMEFT, already violates CP, there is no reason to impose this symmetry on the higher-dimensional operators. In fact, many SMEFT operators can introduce new sources of CP violation and are actively studied for this reason. Therefore, CP symmetry is not required to be respected.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry**: This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation, parity inversion, and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, the CPT theorem applies. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of one of its core assumptions, such as Lorentz invariance.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.\n\n<<<D>>>"
