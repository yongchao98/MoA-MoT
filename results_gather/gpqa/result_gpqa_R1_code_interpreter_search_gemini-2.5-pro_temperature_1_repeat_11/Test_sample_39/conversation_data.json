    "*   **Analysis of the situation:** The conversation takes place in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A key activity in such a lab is synthesizing a target compound and then purifying it from a mixture that may contain unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and the desired product.\n*   **The phrase \"on top of each other\":** This is a common piece of jargon among chemists. It almost always refers to the result of a chromatographic separation, specifically Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography.\n*   **Chromatography as a separation technique:** Chromatography is the most common method for purifying compounds in an organic chemistry lab. It works by separating components of a mixture based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**.\n*   **Visualizing the problem:** Chemists often use TLC to quickly assess the composition of a mixture and to determine the right conditions for a larger-scale purification by column chromatography. On a TLC plate, different compounds travel up the plate at different rates, appearing as distinct spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate, and their spots will be very close together or overlap, appearing to be \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   A) Non-covalent interactions are the basis for separation by chromatography, but the statement isn't about the fundamental physics; it's about the practical outcome of a failed separation. It's too general.\n    *   B) Optical rotation is a property used for characterization, not separation. While enantiomers are hard to separate, this phrase is used much more broadly for any difficult separation, not just for chiral compounds.\n    *   C) Similar boiling points would make separation by distillation difficult. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of the visual result on a TLC plate than the data from a distillation.\n    *   D) Similar polarities are the direct cause of compounds being inseparable by the most common purification method, chromatography. The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a direct and common description of what a chemist sees on a TLC plate when compounds have similar polarities, leading to a failed separation. This is the most specific and accurate interpretation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
