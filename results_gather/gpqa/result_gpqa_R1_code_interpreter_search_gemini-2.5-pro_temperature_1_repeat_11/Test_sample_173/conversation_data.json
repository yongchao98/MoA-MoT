    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State and Given Information\n*   An atomic nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments, let's call their rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   We are told `m1` is the more massive fragment, with a rest mass twice that of the lighter one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass `M`: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses and Rest Energies of the Fragments\nFirst, we solve for the individual rest masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (fragment 1): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of the lighter fragment (fragment 2): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released\nThe difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the fission.\n*   `Total Kinetic Energy (T_total) = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate `T1` using Classical (Non-relativistic) Approximation\nIn any frame, but especially the rest frame of the initial nucleus, momentum is conserved.\n*   `P_initial = 0`\n*   `P_final = p1 + p2 = 0`, which means `p1 = -p2` and their magnitudes are equal: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `T1 / T2 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1 + (2*T1) = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1 = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics\nMomentum conservation `|p1| = |p2|` still holds. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nThis can be rearranged to solve for momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + mc^2`.\nSubstituting this in gives: `(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n\nSince `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`, we can write:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nNow substitute the known values:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `T2 = 3 - T1` (from `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`)\n\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` term appears on both sides and cancels out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nNow, solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600 * T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer from GeV to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\nMc2 = 300\n\n# Calculate rest energies of the fragments\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# -> 3*m2 = 0.99*M -> m2 = 0.33*M\n# -> m1 = 0.66*M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Total kinetic energy released\nT_total = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Classical calculation for T1\n# T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2 -> T2 = 2*T1\n# T1 + T2 = T_total -> T1 + 2*T1 = T_total -> 3*T1 = T_total\nT1_classical = T_total / 3\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1\n# (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# T2 = T_total - T1\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = (T_total - T1)^2 + 2*(T_total - T1)*m2c2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T_total^2 - 2*T_total*T1 + T1^2 + 2*T_total*m2c2 - 2*T1*m2c2\n# 2*T1*m1c2 = T_total^2 - 2*T_total*T1 + 2*T_total*m2c2 - 2*T1*m2c2\n# T1 * (2*m1c2 + 2*T_total + 2*m2c2) = T_total^2 + 2*T_total*m2c2\n# T1 = (T_total**2 + 2*T_total*m2c2) / (2*m1c2 + 2*T_total + 2*m2c2)\n# An easier way is the derivation from the thought block: 600*T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = 603 / 600\n\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV} MeV.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n    *   It splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Relation between fragment masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Sum of fragment rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Masses and Rest Energies of the Fragments:**\n    *   We have a system of two linear equations:\n        1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n        2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   Substitute (1) into (2): `(2*m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M` which gives `3*m2 = 0.99*M`.\n    *   Solve for `m2`: `m2 = (0.99 / 3) * M = 0.33 * M`.\n    *   Solve for `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n    *   Now, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n        *   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (1): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   Rest energy of the lighter fragment (2): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    *   The difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n    *   `Total Kinetic Energy (T_total) = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   So, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energy T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   From the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum be `p`.\n    *   `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    *   The classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n    *   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `T1 / T2 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n    *   This gives us `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n    *   Now, use the total kinetic energy: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `T2 = 2*T1`, we get `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`, which means `3*T1 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Therefore, the classical value is `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energy T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula:**\n    *   Conservation of momentum `|p1| = |p2| = p` still holds.\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n    *   We can write `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n    *   Since the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   Therefore, `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`.\n    *   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n    *   `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`.\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n    *   Combine the `T1` terms: `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`.\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`.\n    *   The correct relativistic value is `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference and Convert Units:**\n    *   The difference is `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   The question asks for the answer in MeV.
