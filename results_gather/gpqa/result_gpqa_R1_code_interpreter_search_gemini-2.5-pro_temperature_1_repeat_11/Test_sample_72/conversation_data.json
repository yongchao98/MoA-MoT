    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThe problem asks for the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since both are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula.\n\nLet the velocity of the first astronaut be $v_1 = 0.6c$ and the velocity of the second astronaut be $v_2 = 0.5c$. Both are moving in the same direction.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) of object 2 with respect to object 1 is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere $m_0$ is the rest mass, and $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n*   Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy ($E_1$):\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n*   Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n$\\gamma_2 \\approx 1.1547$\n\nNow, calculate the energy ($E_2$):\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_2 \\approx 2 \\times 1.732 \\times mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c\n*   Total energy ($E$) ≈ 5.96 mc^2\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
