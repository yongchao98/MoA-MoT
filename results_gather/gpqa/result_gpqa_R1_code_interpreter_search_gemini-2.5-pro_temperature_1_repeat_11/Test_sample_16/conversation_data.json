    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is given as:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Consider the dissociation of the complex:**\n    Since we start with the Ca-EDTA complex, it's more convenient to consider its dissociation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for this dissociation ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium. The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    *Note: The problem mentions \"ideal pH\", which means we can assume that EDTA exists predominantly as $EDTA^{4-}$, and we don't need to consider its protonation and the conditional formation constant.*\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n    Substituting the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This implies that the dissociation is minimal, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Solve for x, which represents $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\n    To make the calculation easier, we can write $4 \\times 10^{-13}$ as $40 \\times 10^{-14}$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n6.  **Verify the approximation:**\n    The calculated value $x = 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ is indeed much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M matches option A.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex in M\nC = 0.02\n\n# Formation constant of the Ca-EDTA complex\nKf = 5e10\n\n# The equilibrium equation based on dissociation is x^2 / (C - x) = 1/Kf\n# where x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions.\n# Since Kf is very large, x will be very small compared to C.\n# We can approximate C - x as C.\n# The equation becomes x^2 / C = 1/Kf\n# So, x = sqrt(C / Kf)\n\nx = math.sqrt(C / Kf)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution Output:\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex will partially dissociate into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). We need to find the equilibrium concentration of the free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n**1. Set up the dissociation equilibrium:**\n\nThe formation of the complex is:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\nThe formation constant for this reaction is given as $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\nSince we are starting with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it is more intuitive to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Determine the dissociation constant ($K_d$):**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant ($K_f$):\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**3. Use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find equilibrium concentrations:**\n\nLet 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of the free ions are 0 M.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**4. Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\nBecause the value of $K_d$ is very small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$), the extent of dissociation 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n$x^2 = (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n$x^2 = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n$[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis value is very close to option A. The Python code calculation also confirmed this result ($6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M).\n\n<<<A>>>"
