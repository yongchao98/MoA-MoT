    "This is a problem about special relativity, specifically time dilation and particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Formula:** The number of particles, N, remaining after a time `t` from an initial number `N₀` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)\n    where τ is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where the time `t` is measured (the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector is N/N₀.\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ)\n\n3.  **Time of Flight (t):** The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius R = 30 m. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, which means their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    t = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Time Dilation:** The particles have a proper mean lifetime, τ₀ (their lifetime in their own rest frame). Due to time dilation, their lifetime in the lab frame (τ) is longer and is given by:\n    τ = γ * τ₀\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations:** Substitute the expressions for `t` and `τ` into the decay fraction formula:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))\n    N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))\n\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    K = R / (c * τ₀)\n    So the formula simplifies to:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\n6.  **Using the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    (N/N₀)₁ = 1/3\n    γ₁ = 20\n\n    Plugging these values into our simplified formula:\n    1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\n    To solve for the constant `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n7.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** Now we want to find the Lorentz factor γ₂ needed for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n    (N/N₀)₂ = 2/3\n    Find γ₂.\n\n    Using the same formula with the value of `K` we just found:\n    2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n    2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)\n    Using the logarithm property ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a):\n    γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n    Using the logarithm property ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b):\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\n8.  **Calculation:** To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a short python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the derived formula: gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\nExecuting this code gives a value of approximately 54.19.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is ~54.19. Looking at the options provided:\n    A) 28\n    B) 54\n    C) 40\n    D) 68\n    The closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t/τ_lab)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles, `N` is the number remaining, and `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. Its lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to its proper lifetime (`τ₀`, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n*   **Time of Flight:** The particles travel from the center to the wall of the detector, a distance `R`. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t = R/v ≈ R/c`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Equation**\n\nCombining these concepts, we can write the survival fraction `f` as:\n`f = exp(-t / τ_lab) = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n`f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\nLet's group the constant terms for this experiment: `C = R / (c * τ₀)`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-C / γ)`\n\n**3. Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant `C`**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n`1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `C`, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n`C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor `γ₂`**\n\nNow, we want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in a survival fraction of `f₂ = 2/3`.\n`2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n\nSubstitute the value of `C` we just found:\n`2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we get `ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2)`.\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nUsing the natural logarithm values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
