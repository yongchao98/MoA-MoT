    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two specific points during the titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n**1. Dilution of Acetic Acid**\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume of the solution (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (M2).\n    *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M2 * (40.00 cm³)\n    *   M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n    \nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) we are titrating is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n\nWhere:\n*   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n*   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   pKa = -log(Ka)\n\nLet's calculate the terms:\n*   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles. At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which will hydrolyze water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻) and making the solution basic.\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo calculate the pH, we need to:\n*   **Find the volume of NaOH added to reach the equivalence point (Veq).**\n    *   Moles of acid = M_acid × V_acid = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid.\n    *   Veq = moles_base / M_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume = V_acid + Veq = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   [A⁻] = moles_acid / total_volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate the concentration of OH⁻ using the Kb for acetate.**\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   For the hydrolysis equilibrium, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻])\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nWe can perform these calculations using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is 25/75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of the diluted acetic acid\nmoles_acid = 0.025 * 0.040  # M_acid * V_acid (in L)\n\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence point\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / 0.1  # moles / M_base\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = 0.040 + vol_NaOH_eq  # V_acid + V_NaOH\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of acetate: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   We start with an initial volume (V₁) of 20.00 cm³ and an initial concentration (M₁) of 0.05 M acetic acid.\n*   We add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the final volume (V₂) is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated.\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating a 0.025 M solution of acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains.\n*   The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which is a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    *   Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   The ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is the same as the ratio of their moles, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   Now, we plug the values into the equation:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The only species affecting the pH is the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Step 3a: Find the moles of acid.**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Step 3b: Find the volume of NaOH needed.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Step 3c: Find the total volume and concentration of acetate.**\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acid, so moles of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   **Step 3d: Calculate [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction.**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   For the hydrolysis equilibrium, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. We can approximate this as Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √( (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   **Step 3e: Calculate pOH and pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n    *   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and a pH of 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
