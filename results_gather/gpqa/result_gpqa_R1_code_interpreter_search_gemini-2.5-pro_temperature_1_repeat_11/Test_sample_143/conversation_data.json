    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance (or mean free path) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physics principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance (L) of a particle is its velocity (v) multiplied by its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n        $L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n    *   Due to special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. The mean lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$) is related to the particle's mean proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n        $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n    *   The particle's velocity is usually expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, c: $v = \\beta c$.\n    *   Combining these, the mean decay distance is: $L = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   The mean proper lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) of the resonance by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Substituting $\\tau$ into the expression for L gives:\n        $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n\n3.  **Extract the given values from the problem:**\n    *   Production energy of X: $E_{X} = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Mass of X: $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$ (In particle physics, mass is often given in units of energy, representing $mc^2$)\n    *   Width of X: $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the necessary kinematic quantities ($\\gamma$ and $\\beta$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_{X}}{m_{X}c^2} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$.\n    *   The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be calculated directly from $\\gamma$ using the identity $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n        $\\gamma \\beta = \\gamma \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 (1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2})} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   Now, calculate the value of $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n        $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{9} - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400 - 9}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Substitute all values into the formula for L:**\n    *   The formula is $L = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_{X}} \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   We need the value of the physical constant $\\hbar c$. A standard value is $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV fm}$, which is equivalent to $1.97327 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{MeV m}$.\n    *   The decay width is given as $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Plugging in the numbers:\n        $L = \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{MeV m}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    To ensure precision, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\n# hbar*c in MeV*m. (from CODATA 2018: 197.3269804 MeV fm)\nhbar_c = 1.973269804e-13\n\n# Given values from the problem\nE_X = 8000  # Energy in MeV\nm_X_c2 = 1200 # Mass (m*c^2) in MeV\nGamma_X = 320 # Width in MeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E_X / m_X_c2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the term sqrt(gamma^2 - 1), which is equal to gamma*beta\ngamma_beta = np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance L\n# The formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau = gamma_beta * c * (hbar / Gamma_X)\n# This can be rearranged to L = gamma_beta * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\nL = gamma_beta * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{L:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0645e-15\n</execute_result>\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   The calculated mean decay distance is $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n    *   The options are:\n        A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n        B) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n        C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n        D) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n    *   The calculated value $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$ is extremely close to option D, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$. The minor difference (about 0.025%) is likely due to the use of slightly different values for the physical constant $\\hbar c$ when the problem was created.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The mean decay distance, $L$, of a particle in the laboratory frame is given by the product of its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{\\text{lab}}$) and its velocity ($v$).\n\n$L = v \\cdot t_{\\text{lab}}$\n\nDue to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$t_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nThe velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light. So the mean decay distance becomes:\n\n$L = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n\nThe proper lifetime $\\tau$ is related to the decay width $\\Gamma_X$ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. Substituting this into the equation for $L$:\n\n$L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\gamma \\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Total energy $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Decay width $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\nNext, we calculate the term $\\gamma \\beta$. We can use the identity $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\gamma \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{9} - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n\nNow we can calculate the mean decay distance $L$. We use the value of the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV fm} = 1.97327 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{MeV m}$.\n\n$L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{MeV m}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n\nThe calculation gives:\n$L \\approx 6.5913 \\times \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-13}}{320} \\, \\text{m}$\n$L \\approx 6.5913 \\times (6.166 \\times 10^{-16}) \\, \\text{m}$\n$L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nThis result matches the value calculated by the Python script. Comparing our result with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nOur calculated value of $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option D. The small difference is likely due to rounding or the use of slightly different values for constants.\n\n<<<D>>>"
