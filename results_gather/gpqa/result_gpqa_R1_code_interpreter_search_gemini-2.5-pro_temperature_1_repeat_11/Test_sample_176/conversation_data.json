    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** For a star radiating as a perfect black body, its luminosity (L) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where A is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature of the star.\n    So, the formula can be written as:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1^2 / R_2^2) \\cdot (T_1^4 / T_2^4) = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n    $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared brightest* is the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$), which can be affected by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect.\n    *   The intrinsic peak wavelength of a star's emission ($\\lambda_{max, rest}$) is determined by its surface temperature (T) according to Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $\\lambda_{max, rest} = b / T$, where b is Wien's constant.\n    *   The relationship between the observed wavelength and the rest wavelength is given by the Doppler shift formula:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\cdot (1 + v_r / c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Combining these, the observed peak wavelength is:\n        $\\lambda_{max, obs} = (b / T) \\cdot (1 + v_r / c)$\n    *   We are given that $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$. So we can set up an equation:\n        $(b / T_1) \\cdot (1 + v_{r1} / c) = (b / T_2) \\cdot (1 + v_{r2} / c)$\n    *   The constant 'b' cancels out. Now, substitute the given radial velocities: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n        $(1 / T_1) \\cdot (1 + 0 / c) = (1 / T_2) \\cdot (1 + 700 / c)$\n        $1 / T_1 = (1 / T_2) \\cdot (1 + 700 / c)$\n    *   To find the ratio $T_1 / T_2$, we rearrange the equation:\n        $T_2 / T_1 = 1 + 700 / c$\n        $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + 700 / c)$\n\n6.  **Substitute Ratios into the Luminosity Ratio Formula:** Now we substitute the expressions for the radius ratio and temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + 700 / c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / c)^4$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The problem now becomes a numerical calculation. We will use the speed of light, c â‰ˆ 299,792.458 km/s. This calculation is best performed with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\nv2 = 700.0      # Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nR_ratio = 1.5   # Ratio of radii R1/R2\n\n# The observed peak wavelengths are the same:\n# lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2\n# (b/T1)*(1 + v1/c) = (b/T2)*(1 + v2/c)\n# With v1 = 0:\n# 1/T1 = (1/T2)*(1 + v2/c)\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\nT_ratio = 1.0 / (1.0 + v2 / c)\n\n# The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229107931327914\n</execute_result>\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229. Looking at the options provided:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user has re-submitted the code output, which confirms the previous calculation.\n\n**Recap of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities is given by $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** The observed peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$) are the same. These are related to the rest-frame peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{max, rest}$) and the radial velocity ($v_r$) by the Doppler effect: $\\lambda_{max, obs} = \\lambda_{max, rest} (1 + v_r/c)$. Wien's Law relates the rest-frame peak wavelength to temperature: $\\lambda_{max, rest} = b/T$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal:\n        $\\frac{b}{T_1}(1 + \\frac{v_{r1}}{c}) = \\frac{b}{T_2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n    *   Substituting $v_{r1} = 0$ and $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s:\n        $\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2}(1 + \\frac{700}{c})$\n    *   This gives the temperature ratio: $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + 700/c)$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + 700/c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\cdot (1 + 700/c)^{-4}$\n\nThe python code correctly calculated this value:\n`L_ratio = 2.229107...`\n\nThis value, rounded to two decimal places, is 2.23. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
