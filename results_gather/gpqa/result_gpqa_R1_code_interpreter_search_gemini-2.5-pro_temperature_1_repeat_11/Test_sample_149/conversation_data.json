    "**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DBE is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional double bond or ring (DBE=1), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Interpretation:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it's coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3), suggesting a -CH2- group is next to the aldehyde. This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is an **amino group (-NH2)**.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a CH2 group. The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). This corresponds to the aldehyde proton, confirming the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group as the two substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amino) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, reacts to form 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   Intermediate 1: `Cl- +N2-(C6H4)-CH2-CHO`\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Intermediate 2: `HO-(C6H4)-CH2-CHO`\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Self-Aldol Condensation)**\n    We now have an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily eliminates a molecule of water. The proton from the alpha-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n    The final structure is:\n    ```\n          (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)\n              C4      C3   C2   C1\n    ```\n    The IUPAC name for this compound is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the final product with the given options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate before dehydration. The heat drives the reaction to the final condensation product.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure; lacks the hydroxyl groups formed in step 2.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the correct name for the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the self-aldol condensation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
