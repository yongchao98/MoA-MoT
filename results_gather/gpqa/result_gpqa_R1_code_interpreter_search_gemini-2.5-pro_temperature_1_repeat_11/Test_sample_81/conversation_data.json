    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Cyclooctatetraene (COT) is heated with maleic anhydride.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a Diels-Alder reaction. Cyclooctatetraene, which normally exists in a non-planar \"tub\" conformation, must first undergo a thermal electrocyclic ring-closure to form its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety which can act as the diene in the Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride is the dienophile.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions typically favor the *endo* adduct due to secondary orbital interactions, which stabilize the transition state. This means the anhydride ring will be oriented on the same side as the cyclobutene ring in the newly formed adduct.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** The reaction yields an *endo* adduct, which is a tricyclic anhydride.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with methanol (CH₃OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is an acid-catalyzed esterification reaction. The anhydride ring of Product 1 is opened by two molecules of methanol to form a diester.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The anhydride is converted into two methyl ester groups. Since the original anhydride was on the *exo* face relative to the norbornene-like bridge and had a *cis* relationship, the resulting ester groups will also be *cis* to each other and maintain their stereochemical position. The product is dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,5R,8S,8aS)-1,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-5,8-ethanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is heated with cyclopentadiene.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is another Diels-Alder reaction. The double bond in the cyclobutene ring of Product 2 acts as the dienophile, and cyclopentadiene acts as the diene.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first Diels-Alder reaction, this addition is also stereoselective. Cyclopentadiene will add to the double bond from the less sterically hindered face. The existing bulky part of the molecule (the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system with the ester groups) will direct the cyclopentadiene to add from the opposite (*exo*) face of the cyclobutene ring. This leads to an *exo* adduct. The addition of cyclopentadiene itself also follows the *endo* rule with respect to its own diene system, but the overall addition to the cyclobutene is *exo*.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The addition of cyclopentadiene to the cyclobutene double bond results in a new polycyclic system. The *exo* addition dictates the final stereochemistry of the molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nFollowing the stereochemical outcomes of each reaction step leads to the formation of a specific major isomer for Product 3. The IUPAC name and SMILES string for this major isomer are:\n\n*   **Name:** dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bR,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate\n*   **SMILES:** `O=C(OC)[C@H]1[C@@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@@H]4[C@H]3[C@@H]5C=C[C@H]4C5)[C@@H]2[C@H]1C(OC)=O`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
