    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 system. Its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_z = B * z_hat`. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_z = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The corresponding energies are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`.\n    *   For the energy to be minimal, if we assume `γ > 0`, `S_z` must be positive. So the initial state is the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`. Its spin eigenvalue is `+ħ/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Understand the New Situation (for t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction: `B_y = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The \"sudden\" change implies that the state of the particle does not change at the instant of the switch. So, `|ψ(t=0+)> = |ψ(t=0-)> = |+z>`.\n    *   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian: `H_new = -μ · B_y = -γB * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   So, `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`.\n    *   To calculate this, it's easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H_new`, which is the eigenbasis of `S_y`. Let's call the eigenstates of `S_y` as `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are `E_y = -γB * (eigenvalues of S_y)`.\n        *   `E_+ = -γB(+ħ/2)` corresponding to eigenstate `|+y>`.\n        *   `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(+ħ/2)` corresponding to eigenstate `|-y>`.\n    *   The energy difference between these two levels is `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n4.  **Relate Oscillation Frequency to Energy Difference:**\n    *   A quantum system in a superposition of two energy eigenstates `E_+` and `E_-` will exhibit oscillatory behavior for expectation values of observables. The angular frequency of this oscillation is directly related to the energy difference between the states: `Ω = ΔE / ħ`.\n    *   Using the energy difference calculated above: `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n    *   This provides the answer directly. The oscillation frequency of any observable that is not conserved under the new Hamiltonian will be `γB`.\n\n5.  **Confirm with Explicit Calculation (Optional but Recommended):**\n    *   First, express the initial state `|+z>` in the `S_y` eigenbasis. The relationship is:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   Now, apply the time evolution operator:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iH_new*t/ħ) * (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n        Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are energy eigenstates:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(-iE_+*t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_-*t/ħ)|-y>]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y>]`\n    *   We want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment: `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`. So we need to calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   To do this, we can express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis.\n        `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`\n        Substituting these into the expression for `|ψ(t)>` and simplifying using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^{ix}+e^{-ix})/2`, `sin(x) = (e^{ix}-e^{-ix})/(2i)`) yields:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * S_z * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * (cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>)`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   Therefore, the average of the z-component of the moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression clearly shows an oscillation with an angular frequency `Ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis with the Larmor frequency `Ω_L = γB`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
