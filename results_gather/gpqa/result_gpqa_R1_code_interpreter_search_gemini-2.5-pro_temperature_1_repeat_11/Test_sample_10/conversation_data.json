    "E) The SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has been shown to induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. However, research indicates that ORF3a also impacts the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Studies have demonstrated that ORF3a can induce the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and significantly upregulate the expression of Bax while downregulating the expression of Bcl-2. Bax is a pro-apoptotic protein, while Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein. The downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax are hallmarks of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Therefore, the statement that ORF3a does not affect the expression levels of Bcl-2 is incorrect, and its apoptotic mechanism is not limited to the extrinsic pathway but also involves the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.\n\n<<<E>>>"
