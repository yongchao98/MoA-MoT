    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (since it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Final State:**\n    A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n    We want to find the joint probability of getting:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$ for electron 1.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$ for electron 2.\n    The final state we are interested in is the uncoupled state described by $|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2> = |1, -1, 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Principle:**\n    The total z-component of the angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum on this state will yield the value $-1\\hbar$.\n    A measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is equivalent to a measurement of the total component $L_z$, because if we get results $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$, the total z-component is $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar$.\n    For a measurement to be possible, the quantum number of the total z-component must be conserved. This means the sum of the measured individual quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal the initial total quantum number ($m$).\n    *   Initial total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   Final (desired) total magnetic quantum number: $m' = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Compare Initial and Final States:**\n    Since the initial total magnetic quantum number ($m = -1$) is not equal to the final total magnetic quantum number ($m' = -2$), this outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n5.  **Use Formalism of Quantum Mechanics (Inner Product):**\n    The probability of finding the system in the final state $|1, -1, 1, -1>$ after the measurement, given it started in the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, is the squared magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    The states $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ and $|1, -1, 1, -1>$ are both eigenstates of the Hermitian operator $L_z$.\n    *   $L_z |1, 1, 2, -1> = -1\\hbar |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n    *   $L_z |1, -1, 1, -1> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |1, -1, 1, -1> = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |1, -1, 1, -1> = -2\\hbar |1, -1, 1, -1>$\n    Since these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they are orthogonal.\n    Therefore, their inner product is zero:\n    $<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability is the square of the inner product:\n    $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nConclusion: It is impossible to measure $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ when the system is in a state with a total $m = -1$. The probability is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
