    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Observations:**\n    *   **Observation 1 (1H NMR):** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   They have similar, but not identical, chemical shifts.\n        *   Their combined integral is 1H, and they have roughly equal individual integrals. This implies a ~1:1 mixture of two species.\n        *   The splitting is not due to spin-spin coupling, meaning the two peaks represent the same proton in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):**\n        *   The analysis shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). This means there are two different compounds (or conformers) that can be separated based on their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n        *   The two peaks have equal intensities, confirming the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum (MS), which matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide. This is a crucial clue: the two species are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and mass).\n        *   The separation occurs even at an *elevated temperature*. This indicates that the two isomers do not interconvert rapidly even with added thermal energy, suggesting a significant energy barrier between them.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" is a procedural term in peptide synthesis. It means performing the coupling step twice to drive the reaction to completion. It does not produce a stable mixture of two different isomeric products. This option describes a process, not a final state that would explain the analytical data. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** Because diastereoisomers are distinct molecules, they are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is entirely plausible for an alpha-proton in one diastereomer to have a different chemical shift from the same proton in the other, leading to two separate peaks.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Since diastereoisomers have different physical properties, they can be separated by chromatography (like LC). This explains the two peaks in the chromatogram. As isomers, they have the same molecular weight, which explains why they have identical mass spectra.\n        *   **The Specific Case in Peptides:** A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **atropisomerism** due to the restricted rotation around the amide (C-N) bond. This bond has partial double-bond character, creating a high energy barrier to rotation. This can lead to two stable conformers (rotamers), often referred to as *cis* and *trans* isomers (especially with proline). These rotamers are diastereomeric in a chiral peptide. The interconversion between them can be slow on the NMR timescale, resulting in separate signals for each rotamer. The fact that they are separable by LC even at elevated temperatures confirms that the energy barrier to rotation is significant. This explanation fits all the observations perfectly.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** In a standard (achiral) NMR experiment, enantiomers are indistinguishable and have identical spectra. You would see only one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are also indistinguishable and would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Since the data shows two peaks in both NMR and LC, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor from the synthesis would be a different chemical compound, almost certainly with a different molecular formula and molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data shows that both separated peaks have the *same mass*, which is consistent with the *target molecule*. A precursor contaminant would have a different mass. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that is consistent with all pieces of experimental evidence (two NMR peaks, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass for both peaks) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The specific phenomenon described strongly suggests the presence of slowly interconverting rotamers around an amide bond, which are a form of diastereoisomer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
