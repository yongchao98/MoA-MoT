    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions. This means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the spatial part of the wavefunction and the energy) and its spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### 2. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n`E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\nwhere `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem conveniently defines a base unit of energy `E` as:\n`E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n\nSo, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of `E`:\n`E_n = n^2 * E`\n\nThis gives us the following energy levels:\n*   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n*   and so on...\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Energies\n\nNow we will fill these energy levels with the four fermions to find the total energy of the system for the ground state and the first two excited states.\n\n#### a) Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy = 1E):** We can place 2 particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy = 4E):** We place the remaining 2 particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)`\n`E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n#### b) First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   The ground state configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   Promote one particle: Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n`E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n#### c) Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possibilities for exciting the system from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Possibility 4:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
