    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n1.  **Understand the Reaction and the Goal:**\n    The reaction is an electrophilic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring. The goal is to arrange the given substances in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the *para*-isomer yield. The weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction (percentage) of the para-isomer formed, as all monobromo-isomers of a given substance have the same molar mass.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:**\n    We need to classify each substituent based on its effect on the benzene ring. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they direct the incoming electrophile to specific positions (ortho, para, or meta).\n\n    *   **Group 1: Ortho, Para-directors.** These will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n        *   1) `C6H5-CH3`: -CH3 (methyl) is an activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n        *   5) `C6H5-C2H5`: -C2H5 (ethyl) is an activating, ortho,para-directing group.\n        *   3) `C6H5-Cl`: -Cl (chloro) is a deactivating, but ortho,para-directing group.\n\n    *   **Group 2: Meta-directors.** These will produce very little of the para-isomer, with the meta-isomer being the major product.\n        *   4) `C6H5-NO2`: -NO2 (nitro) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n        *   6) `C6H5-COOH`: -COOH (carboxyl) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n        *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5`: -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n3.  **Initial Ranking:**\n    Substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields. Substances with ortho,para-directing groups will have the highest yields. Therefore, the overall order will be:\n    {Group 2 substances} < {Group 1 substances}\n\n4.  **Rank within the Meta-directors (Group 2):**\n    For these meta-directing groups, the para-isomer yield is extremely low. The yield of the non-meta products (ortho and para) decreases as the deactivating strength of the substituent increases. We need to rank them by deactivating strength.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: `C6H5-NO2` < `C6H5-COOH` < `C6H5-COOC2H5`.\n    *   This corresponds to the numerical order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n5.  **Check the Options:**\n    At this point, we can look at the provided options to see if any match this initial part of the sequence.\n    *   A) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n    *   B) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n    *   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n    *   D) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n    Only **Option D** starts with the correct sequence `4 < 6 < 2`. This strongly suggests that D is the intended answer.\n\n6.  **Rank within the Ortho, Para-directors (Group 1) to confirm:**\n    For these groups, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the para/ortho ratio. This ratio is primarily determined by the steric hindrance of the substituent. A larger group will block the ortho positions more, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   Substituents: -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), -Cl (3).\n    *   Let's compare their effect on the para-isomer yield based on experimental data for bromination:\n        *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** Yields ~62% para product. The methyl group has some steric bulk.\n        *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** Yields ~69-87% para product. Although a single atom, its strong inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho position more than the distant para position, leading to high para selectivity.\n        *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** Yields ~94% para product. The larger ethyl group provides significant steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position highly favored.\n    *   Based on this data, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene < Chlorobenzene < Ethylbenzene.\n    *   This corresponds to the numerical order: **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n7.  **Final Assembly and Conclusion:**\n    Combining the two groups gives the fully correct order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n    Now, let's re-examine Option D: `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`.\n    *   The first part `4 < 6 < 2` is correct.\n    *   The second part `1 < 5 < 3` is incorrect. It swaps the positions of chlorobenzene (3) and ethylbenzene (5) compared to the experimental data.\n\n    However, since Option D is the only one that correctly orders the meta-directors (the most significant factor distinguishing the substances), it is the most plausible answer, likely containing a minor error in the original question's options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
