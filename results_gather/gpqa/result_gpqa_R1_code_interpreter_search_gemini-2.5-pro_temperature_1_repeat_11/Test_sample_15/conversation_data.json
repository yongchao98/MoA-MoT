    "An analysis of each compound is required to determine its chirality, which is the property that leads to optical activity. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral (i.e., non-superimposable on its mirror image).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a double bond, and the atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, E). The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers.\n    *   When a specific enantiomer of a compound is named (i.e., it's not a racemic mixture or a meso compound), it is by definition chiral.\n    *   Chiral compounds are optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3: -H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral carbon group.\n    *   For molecules with two identical chiral centers, the isomer with (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is a **meso compound**.\n    *   A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry (in at least one of its conformations) or a center of inversion, which makes it achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) configuration describes one of a pair of enantiomers. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   Since it is not the meso form, it is a chiral molecule.\n    *   A single, pure enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name includes the stereochemical descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific enantiomer.\n    *   The chiral center is C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring.\n    *   The molecule is chiral. As a specific enantiomer is given, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors (s, s, s) indicate a *cis* relative stereochemistry, meaning all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   In its most stable chair conformation, all three -OH groups can occupy equatorial positions.\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (each plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbons:\n        *   The two terminal methyl groups are not chiral.\n        *   The carbon they are attached to, -CH(CH3)2, is bonded to a -H, a -CH2- group, and two identical -CH3 groups. It is not chiral.\n        *   The -CH2- carbon is not chiral.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is sp2 hybridized and not chiral.\n        *   The carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are all -CH2- except for the one bonded to the carbonyl group, so none are chiral.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. It can adopt a conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are the ones that are chiral.\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
