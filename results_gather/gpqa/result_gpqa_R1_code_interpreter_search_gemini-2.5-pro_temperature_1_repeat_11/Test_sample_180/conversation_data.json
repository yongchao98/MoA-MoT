    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Core Question:** Calculate the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV).\n    *   **Key Condition:** The pp-III branch of the Sun's proton-proton chain stopped producing neutrinos about 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, this change is just now observable on Earth.\n    *   **Assumptions:** All other neutrino-producing reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) are unaffected. Neutrino oscillations don't affect the ratio.\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    The first step is to identify which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the energy ranges we are interested in. I need to recall or look up the different neutrino sources and their energy spectra.\n\n    *   **Proton-Proton (pp) chain:**\n        *   `p + p → d + e⁺ + νe` (pp neutrinos): Continuous spectrum, max energy ~420 keV. **Does not contribute to either band.**\n        *   `p + e⁻ + p → d + νe` (pep neutrinos): Monoenergetic line at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV). **Does not contribute to either band.**\n        *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe` (⁷Be neutrinos, from pp-II branch): Monoenergetic line at 861 keV (and a much weaker one at 383 keV). The 861 keV line falls squarely in **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n        *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe` (⁸B neutrinos, from pp-III branch): Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. These would normally contribute to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n    *   **CNO Cycle:**\n        *   `¹³N → ¹³C + e⁺ + νe` (¹³N neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 1.20 MeV (1200 keV). These contribute to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n        *   `¹⁵O → ¹⁵N + e⁺ + νe` (¹⁵O neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 1.73 MeV (1730 keV). These contribute to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Hypothetical Condition:**\n    The problem states that the **pp-III branch has stopped**. This means the `⁸B` neutrinos are no longer being produced. We must therefore remove them from our analysis of the current flux.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Flux in Each Band *After* the Stoppage:**\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   With `⁸B` neutrinos gone, the only remaining contributors are the CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`). Their spectra are continuous and smooth in this region.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   The CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) are also present here.\n        *   Crucially, the `⁷Be` neutrinos from the unaffected pp-II branch are also present. They produce a very strong, sharp, monoenergetic peak at 861 keV.\n\n5.  **Compare the Fluxes and Calculate the Ratio:**\n\n    *   The numerator, Flux(Band 1), consists only of the contribution from the tail end of the CNO neutrino spectra.\n    *   The denominator, Flux(Band 2), consists of a similar contribution from the CNO spectra PLUS the entire, very large flux from the `⁷Be` line.\n\n    Let's consult a standard solar neutrino flux diagram to get a sense of the magnitudes.\n\n    *   The `⁷Be` neutrino line at 861 keV has a total flux of about 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n    *   The CNO neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) have total fluxes on the order of 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s. Their flux is spread out over a wide energy range.\n\n    The flux *density* (flux per keV) of the CNO neutrinos is relatively low and smoothly varying across our two bands. In contrast, the `⁷Be` source concentrates its entire massive flux into a single energy line within Band 2.\n\n    Therefore:\n    *   Flux(Band 1) ≈ Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)  <-- *This is a relatively small number.*\n    *   Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux_CNO(800-900 keV) + Flux_⁷Be(861 keV) <-- *This is dominated by the huge ⁷Be flux.*\n\n    The ratio is:\n    Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) = (small number) / (small number + very large number)\n\n    This ratio will be much less than 1. The flux from the `⁷Be` line is about 10 times greater than the total flux from the `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos combined. Since the CNO flux is spread out over more than 1000 keV, its contribution within any 100 keV band is far smaller than the total `⁷Be` flux concentrated in a single line. The `⁷Be` contribution in Band 2 will be at least two orders of magnitude (100x) larger than the CNO contribution in Band 1.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio will be on the order of 0.01 or even smaller.\n\n6.  **Select the Best Answer:**\n    The calculated ratio is very small. Let's look at the options:\n    A) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n    B) 1\n    C) 10\n    D) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n\n    The value 0.01 is the most appropriate estimate for this ratio.\n\n<<<D>>>"
