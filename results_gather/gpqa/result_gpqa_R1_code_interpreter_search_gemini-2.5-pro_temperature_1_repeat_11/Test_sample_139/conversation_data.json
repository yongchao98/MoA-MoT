    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Decoding the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, this means heating the precipitate G releases D₂O. This is characteristic of a deuterated hydrate, most likely a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n    *   For example: M(OD)n --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms.\"**\n    *   We know the reaction involves deuterium (from D₂O). This makes it highly likely that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is deuterium (D).\n    *   Let's analyze possible candidates for gas W (equal protons and neutrons):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Protons = 1+1=2; Neutrons = 1+1=2. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Protons = 7+7=14; Neutrons = 7+7=14. This fits.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): Protons = 6+8=14; Neutrons = 6+8=14. This fits.\n    *   Considering the context (D₂O is produced), a reaction producing D₂ gas is the most logical choice for W.\n    *   The overall reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate). Since G is a metal deuteroxide and D₂ is produced, a plausible reaction is the violent reaction of a metal deuteride (X) with heavy water (Y).\n    *   Reaction scheme: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W).\n    *   For a precipitate (G) to form, the metal deuteroxide must be insoluble. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a known gelatinous precipitate. This suggests that Substance X contains aluminum.\n    *   A common and powerful deuteride reagent containing aluminum is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verifying LiAlD₄ with the remaining clues.**\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) reacts with D₂O (Y).\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W)`\n    *   This reaction is notoriously violent. It produces D₂ gas (W), which has equal protons and neutrons. It forms a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (G). Heating G (2Al(OD)₃) produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This hypothesis fits all the chemical reaction clues perfectly.\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group (3 oxygen atoms in total).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both functional groups.\n        *   Ketone reduction: -C(=O)- → -CD(OH)-\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CH₂OH\n        *   So, the keto acid R-C(=O)-COOH is reduced to the diol R-CD(OH)-CH₂OH. This final product contains two hydroxyl (-OH) groups, and therefore **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        *   X is LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminum Hydride).\n        *   LiAlH₄ is an extremely common, powerful, and important reducing agent used extensively in organic chemistry. LiAlD₄ is its deuterated version used for isotopic labeling. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**2. Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Mass**\n\n*   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄:**\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Atomic Number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (lowest Z) is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (highest Z) is **Aluminium**.\n\n*   **Sum the masses of these elements as they appear in the formula:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses, considering all instances of the elements. We will use integer masses (mass numbers) as the options are integers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula contains four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The formula contains one atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its most stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n*   **Calculate the final sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
