    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" (let's call it S) is the stationary frame.\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* because it's the time measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Physics Plan:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `Δx = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Since the ejecta is moving at a relativistic speed (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we must account for time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (S') by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan (Step-by-Step Calculation):**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio `v/c` (often denoted as `β`).**\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance `Δx` in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n        `Δx = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    *   **Step 5: Compute the final numerical value.**\n        To get the final number, we need to calculate `sqrt(0.96)` and perform the division. I will use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n<execute_result>\n3061862.178478972\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862.18 km. Looking at the options:\n\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 3,000,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's intended answer.\n\nA classical (non-relativistic) calculation would give `Distance = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option B). However, because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is slightly longer than 50 seconds, so the distance covered must be slightly more than 3,000,000 km. This confirms that a relativistic calculation is necessary and the answer must be greater than 3,000,000 km.\n\nThe result 3,061,862.18 km is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is the stationary frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **List the given quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time*.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame, `Δx`.\n\n4.  **Apply the relevant physics formulas:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `Δx = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Due to relativistic effects, the time measured in the stationary frame S (`Δt`) is longer than the time measured in the moving frame S' (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the calculations:**\n\n    *   **First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Next, calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ`:**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02062`\n\n    *   **Then, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`:**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n    *   **Finally, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, `Δx`:**\n        `Δx = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 3,000,000 km\nC) 2,940,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe closest answer is A. The small discrepancy is due to rounding in the options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
