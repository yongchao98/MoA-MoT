    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **The Core Principle:** The Heisenberg Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can simultaneously know the energy of a particle and the time for which it possesses that energy. The mathematical relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n*   **Applying the Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   For a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ), the lifetime itself represents the uncertainty in time (Δt ≈ τ).\n    *   This finite lifetime results in an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in the energy level of the state. This is often called \"lifetime broadening\" or \"natural linewidth\".\n    *   We can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty (the width of the energy level) as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than their energy widths. The limiting factor is the state with the *larger* energy width. A state with a shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty.\n    *   So, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE_larger\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    1.  We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV⋅s, as the options are in eV and the lifetimes are in seconds.\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s\n\n    2.  Calculate the energy width (ΔE1) for the first state:\n        *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    3.  Calculate the energy width (ΔE2) for the second state:\n        *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Determining the Minimum Energy Difference:**\n    *   The energy width of the first state (ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than the second (ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV). This is expected, as the first state has a shorter lifetime.\n    *   To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n    *   Therefore, the required energy difference is: |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (Resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy separation is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n**2. Python Code for Verification:**\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The required energy difference must be larger than the largest width\nrequired_energy_diff = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be > {required_energy_diff:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-8,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-11,\n    'D': 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_diff:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nTo resolve the levels, the energy difference must be > 6.582e-07 eV\n\nChecking the options:\nOption A (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference.\nOption C (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption D (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\n```\nThe code confirms that the required energy separation must be greater than approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV, and only option B (10⁻⁴ eV) satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty (or \"width\") of its energy level.\n\n**1. Understand the Principle:**\nThe principle states: ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor an unstable quantum state, its lifetime (τ) can be considered as the time uncertainty (Δt). This means that the energy level is not perfectly sharp but has a certain width, ΔE, given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. This effect is known as \"lifetime broadening\" or \"natural linewidth\".\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be larger than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁), which is the limiting factor. Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than the larger of the two widths.\n*   Required Energy Difference > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)\n*   Required Energy Difference > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options:**\nWe need to find the option that is greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels, given their lifetime broadening.\n\n<<<B>>>"
