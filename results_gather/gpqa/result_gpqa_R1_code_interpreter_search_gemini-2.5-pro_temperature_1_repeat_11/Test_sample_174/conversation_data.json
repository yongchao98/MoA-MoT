    "An oscillating spheroid charge distribution, particularly when viewed from the radiation zone (far-field), can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. Let's assume the oscillation and the axis of symmetry are along the z-axis.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `K` is a factor that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment, the frequency of oscillation, and fundamental constants.\n*   `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe function `f` mentioned in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, so `f ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nTherefore, `A = K * sin²(90°) = K * (1)² = K`.\n\nNow, we need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\nThe power radiated at 30° is:\nP(30°) = K * sin²(30°)\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe power at 30° is `P(30°) = K * (1/4) = A/4`.\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation. The full expression for the power per unit solid angle is:\n\ndP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)\n\nwhere `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation. The problem states that the radiation has a wavelength `λ`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by:\n\nω = 2πf_freq = 2π(c/λ)\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light.\n\nLet's look at the dependence of the radiated power on `ω` and hence on `λ`:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴\n\nSubstituting the relation `ω ∝ 1/λ`, we get:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nSo, a possible form for the function `f(λ, θ)` includes a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This is the characteristic dependence for electric dipole radiation, also seen in phenomena like Rayleigh scattering.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the dependence of the radiated power on wavelength is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we match them with the given options.\n\n*   A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n*   B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n*   C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n*   D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
