    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Setup and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is held at an electric potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere. The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\nThis problem is solved using the **method of images**. The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThis arrangement ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, correctly modeling the grounded conductor for the region outside the sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe work done `U` is the integral of the external force `F_ext` required to move the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The external force is the negative of the electric force `F_elec` exerted by the induced charges on `q`.\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext ⋅ dx = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_elec ⋅ dx`\n\nThe electric force on `q` when it is at a variable distance `x` from the center is the same as the force exerted by its corresponding image charge `q_image(x) = -qR/x` at `b(x) = R²/x`.\nThe distance between the charge at `x` and its image is `x - b(x) = x - R²/x`.\n\nThe force is:\n`F_elec(x) = k * q * q_image / (distance)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F_elec(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = -∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, let `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n`U = k * q² * R * (1/2) ∫(from x=∞ to x=d) u⁻² du`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/u] (from x=∞ to x=d)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [-1/(x² - R²)] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q² * R * [(-1/(d² - R²)) - (-1/∞)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the result that for a charge `q` brought near a conductor, the total potential energy `U` is half the interaction energy of the final charge with the final induced potential.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is identical to the potential created by the final image charge `q' = -qR/d` at position `b = R²/d`.\n\nThe distance between the final charge `q` and its image `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\nThe potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U = -kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U = -(1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U = -(1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nOur derived expression matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
