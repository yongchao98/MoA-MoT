    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Given:** The number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`) varies as `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   **Goal:** Find how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (`dN/dr`) varies with distance (`r`). We want to find the exponent `n` in the relation `dN/dr ∝ r^n`.\n    *   **Key Relationship:** The fundamental connection between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) is that they are inversely proportional. For astronomical distances, the relationship is `plx = 1/r`. (Assuming parallax in arcseconds and distance in parsecs).\n\n2.  **Formulate a Strategy:**\n    *   We have a relationship involving a derivative with respect to parallax (`d/d(plx)`).\n    *   We want a relationship involving a derivative with respect to distance (`d/dr`).\n    *   The chain rule from calculus is the perfect tool to connect these two derivatives. The chain rule states:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n3.  **Execute the Strategy:**\n    *   **Step 1: Find the term `d(plx)/dr`**.\n        *   We know `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n        *   We can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r` using the power rule (`d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)`).\n        *   `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`.\n        *   In terms of proportionality, we are interested in how the magnitude changes, so we can write: `d(plx)/dr ∝ 1/r²`. The negative sign just indicates that as one quantity increases, the other decreases.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation.**\n        *   We have `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`.\n        *   Substitute the given information: `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n        *   Substitute the derivative we just calculated: `d(plx)/dr ∝ 1/r²` (or `r⁻²`).\n        *   Putting it together: `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (r⁻²)`.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Express everything in terms of the desired variable, `r`.**\n        *   The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to eliminate `plx`.\n        *   Use the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n        *   Substitute this into the `plx⁻⁵` term: `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵`.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Simplify the final expression.**\n        *   Substitute the result from Step 3 back into the proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n            `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (r⁻²)`.\n        *   Using the rule of exponents (`x^a * x^b = x^(a+b)`):\n            `dN/dr ∝ r^(5 + (-2)) = r³`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Final Answer:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r³`.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
