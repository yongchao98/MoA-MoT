    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 typically corresponds to a benzene ring. The remaining DBE of 1 suggests an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to a double bond or aromatic ring), which typically absorbs around 1715-1730 cm-1.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant chemical shift difference between the two doublets suggests one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting ortho protons downfield).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This points to an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group. This would account for the upfield aromatic signal (~7.0 ppm).\n    3.  The other pieces are an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) and a carbonyl group (C=O). The IR and NMR data suggest they form an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ester group is electron-withdrawing.\n    4.  Placing the electron-withdrawing ester group on the benzene ring would deshield the ortho protons, accounting for the downfield aromatic signal (~8.0 ppm).\n    5.  The proposed structure is an -NH2 group and a -COOCH2CH3 group at the 1 and 4 positions of a benzene ring. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n    *   **Formula Check:** C6H4(ring) + NH2 + C(O)O + C2H5 = C9H11NO2. The formula is correct.\n    *   **Spectra Check:** The structure is fully consistent with all the provided IR and NMR data. The primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and para-substituted ring are all clearly identified.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, not a primary amine/ester.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is meta-substituted and an amide.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), whose -CH2- quartet would appear around 2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all the data perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
