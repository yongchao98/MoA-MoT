    "This problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the total masses of two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2.\n\n### 1. Identify Given Information\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude of Star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n*   Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude of Star 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude of Star 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n*   Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude of Star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n### 2. Recall the Relevant Physics Formula\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) using a formula derived from Kepler's third law. The formula is:\n\n(m1 + m2) * sin³(i) = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G)\n\nwhere:\n*   `m1` and `m2` are the masses of the two stars.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit with respect to the plane of the sky.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is crucial information, as it implies that we are viewing the systems nearly edge-on. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWith this simplification, the formula for the total mass becomes:\n\nM_total = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G)\n\n### 3. Set up the Mass Ratio Calculation\n\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio M1 / M2.\n\nLet M1 be the total mass of system_1 and M2 be the total mass of system_2.\n\nM1 = P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2 * π * G)\nM2 = P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2 * π * G)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio M1 / M2:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2 * π * G)] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2 * π * G)]\n\nThe constant term (2 * π * G) cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]³\n\n### 4. Calculate the Values\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of the velocity semi-amplitudes for each system:\n*   For system_1: K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   For system_2: K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute the known values into the ratio formula. Note that as long as the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are consistent, they will cancel out correctly in the ratio.\n\n*   P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   (K1_total / K2_total) = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.432.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5   # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1   # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity semi-amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2)\n# M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculation shows that the mass of system_1 is 0.432 times the mass of system_2. This means system_1 is less massive than system_2. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem deals with spectroscopic binary stars. The mass of such a system can be determined using the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The key formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM_total = m1 + m2 = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nwhere:\n*   M_total is the total mass of the system.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a crucial piece of information. An eclipse can only happen if we are viewing the system edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is close to 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the formula significantly:\n\nM_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\n**2. Set Up the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2):\n\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G) ]\n\nThe constant term `(2 * π * G)` appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nLet's plug in the numbers for each system.\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow substitute these into the ratio formula:\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * [ (15) / (25) ]³\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Result**\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe result of the calculation is 0.432. This value is closest to the option B) ~ 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
