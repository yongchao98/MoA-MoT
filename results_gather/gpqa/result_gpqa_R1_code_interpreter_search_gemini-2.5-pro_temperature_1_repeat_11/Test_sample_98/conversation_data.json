    "This is a structure elucidation problem that can be solved by analyzing the provided spectroscopic data, particularly the ¹H NMR splitting patterns.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is characteristic.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThis is the key to solving the problem. We need to find the molecule whose spectrum would contain both of the complex signals described. The multiplicity (splitting) of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) and follows the n+1 rule. A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1).\n    *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   A group of three neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3).\n    *   In summary, the proton has a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different single proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1).\n    *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   A different group of two neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   In summary, this proton has a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each candidate molecule to see which one matches these requirements. We will focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are bonded to the most other carbons and are likely to be the source of such complex signals.\n\n#### Candidate A: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n```\n      CH₃   CH₃\n      |     |\nCH₃-CH₂-CH - CH - COOH\n      (b)  (a)\n```\n*   **Proton H(a):** Coupled to H(b) (1H) and the adjacent CH₃ (3H). Signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   **Proton H(b):** Coupled to H(a) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ (2H), and its own CH₃ (3H). This proton has a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors. Its signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** This molecule has the `dtq` signal but does not have any proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbor set needed to produce a `dtt` signal. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n#### Candidate B: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n```\n      CH₃   CH₃\n      |     |\n(CH₃)₂CH - CH - CH₂ - COOH\n        (c)  (b)\n```\n*   **Proton H(b):** Coupled to the adjacent CH₂ (2H), H(c) (1H), and its own CH₃ (3H). Signal would be a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**. This is the same neighbor set as a `dtq`.\n*   **Proton H(c):** Coupled to H(b) (1H) and the two terminal CH₃ groups (6H). Signal would be a **doublet of septets**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This molecule has a `dtq` (or `tdq`) signal but no `dtt` signal. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n#### Candidate C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n```\n      C₂H₅   C₂H₅\n      |      |\nCH₃-CH₂-CH  -  CH  - COOH\n      (d)    (b)\n```\n*   **Proton H(b):** Coupled to H(d) (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). Signal would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Proton H(d):** Coupled to H(b) (1H), the main-chain CH₂ group (2H), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H). This proton has a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors. Its signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This molecule has the `dtt` signal, but it lacks a proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighbor set needed to produce a `dtq` signal. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n#### Candidate D: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)\nLet's first correctly interpret the condensed formula: `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`.\n```\n           C₂H₅   C₂H₅\n           |      |\n      CH₃ - CH -  CH  - CH₂ - COOH\n          (d)    (b)\n```\n*   **Proton H(b) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) -> triplet\n    2.  The proton H(d) at C4 (1H) -> doublet\n    3.  The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2H) -> triplet\n    This proton has a {1H, 2H, 2H} set of neighbors. Its signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n\n*   **Proton H(d) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The CH₃ group at C5 (3H) -> quartet\n    2.  The proton H(b) at C3 (1H) -> doublet\n    3.  The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C4 (2H) -> triplet\n    This proton has a {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors. Its signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal described.\n\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This molecule is the only one that has both a proton that will produce a `dtt` signal and a different proton that will produce a `dtq` signal. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
