    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule given by the condensed formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the formula to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds.\nThe structure can be visualized as a carbon chain with several methyl group substituents.\n\n*   The molecule starts with `(CH3)2C=`, which is a carbon atom double-bonded to the next carbon in the chain and also single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups.\n*   The chain continues with `-CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=`.\n*   The molecule ends with `=C(CH3)2`, which is a carbon atom double-bonded to the previous carbon and also single-bonded to two methyl groups.\n\nLet's draw the full structure to count the atoms and bonds correctly:\n      CH3         CH3                        CH3\n      |           |                          |\nCH3 - C(1) = C(2)H - C(3)H2 - C(4)H - C(5)H2 - C(6)H = C(7) - CH3\n      |                         |                        |\n      CH3                       CH3                      CH3\n\nWait, reading the formula again: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nLet's trace the connections:\n*   `C(CH3)2` is connected via a double bond to `CH`.\n*   `CH` is connected via a single bond to `CH2`.\n*   `CH2` is connected via a single bond to `CH(CH3)`.\n*   `CH(CH3)` is connected via a single bond to `CH2`.\n*   `CH2` is connected via a single bond to `CH`.\n*   `CH` is connected via a double bond to `C(CH3)2`.\n\nAll valencies are satisfied (each carbon has 4 bonds).\n\nNow, let's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):**\n    *   (CH3)2C= : 1 central C + 2 methyl C = 3 C\n    *   -CH- : 1 C\n    *   -CH2- : 1 C\n    *   -CH(CH3)- : 1 chain C + 1 methyl C = 2 C\n    *   -CH2- : 1 C\n    *   -CH= : 1 C\n    *   =C(CH3)2 : 1 central C + 2 methyl C = 3 C\n    *   Total Carbons = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   (CH3)2C= : 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   -CH- : 1 H\n    *   -CH2- : 2 H\n    *   -CH(CH3)- : 1 H + 3 H = 4 H\n    *   -CH2- : 2 H\n    *   -CH= : 1 H\n    *   =C(CH3)2 : 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C-C bonds:**\n    *   Chain bonds: C=C-C-C-C-C=C. The single bonds in the chain are between C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. That's 4 C-C bonds.\n    *   Branch bonds:\n        *   (CH3)2C= has 2 C-C bonds to the methyl groups.\n        *   -CH(CH3)- has 1 C-C bond to the methyl group.\n        *   =C(CH3)2 has 2 C-C bonds to the methyl groups.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 4 (chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 (branches) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule (ΔH_atomization)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nΔH_atomization = (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nUsing the given bond energies:\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization(C12H22) = (2 × 300) + (9 × 200) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atomization(C12H22) = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms**\n\nThis is the energy required to form the constituent atoms (12 moles of C, 22 moles of H) in their gaseous state from their elements in their standard states (C(graphite) and H2(g)).\nReaction: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\n*   Enthalpy for C: 12 × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 × 1000 = 12000 kJ\n*   Enthalpy for H: We need to form 22 moles of H(g) from 11 moles of H2(g). The bond energy of H-H is the energy to break 1 mole of H2 into 2 moles of H.\n    *   Energy = 11 × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of formation of atoms = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of the compound can be found using Hess's Law, based on the cycle:\nElements (standard state) → Gaseous Atoms → Gaseous Compound\nΔH_f(compound) = (Total enthalpy of formation of gaseous atoms) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\nΔH_f(C12H22) = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g and Compare with Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's convert this to kJ/g to check against the options.\n\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol** (using integer masses as implied by the problem's round numbers).\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nNow let's check the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol - This is the enthalpy of atomization, not formation.\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol - Incorrect.\nC) 11.44 kJ/g - This matches our calculated value.\nD) 1900 kJ/g - The numerical value matches our result in kJ/mol, but the units are incorrect.\n\nThe correctly calculated value for the enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to 11.44 kJ/g. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nTo confirm the numerical calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nH_atom_C = 1000  # Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon (kJ/mol)\nBE_HH = 100      # Bond energy of H-H (kJ/mol)\nBE_CC = 200      # Bond energy of C-C (kJ/mol)\nBE_C_dbl_C = 300 # Bond energy of C=C (kJ/mol)\nBE_CH = 400      # Bond energy of C-H (kJ/mol)\n\n# Counts from the molecular formula C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_C_dbl_C = 2\nnum_C_C = 9\nnum_C_H = 22\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule\nH_atom_molecule = (num_C_dbl_C * BE_C_dbl_C) + (num_C_C * BE_CC) + (num_C_H * BE_CH)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of formation of the gaseous atoms from their standard states\n# The formation of 22 H(g) atoms comes from 11 H2(g) molecules.\nH_f_atoms = (num_C * H_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * BE_HH)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound in kJ/mol\nH_f_compound_mol = H_f_atoms - H_atom_molecule\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the molar mass of the compound (using integer masses)\nmolar_mass_compound = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# Step 5: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nH_f_compound_gram = H_f_compound_mol / molar_mass_compound\n\nprint(H_f_compound_gram)\n```\n> 실행 결과\n```\n11.44578313253012\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the enthalpy of formation is approximately 11.45 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An explanation of the method used to solve the problem is provided below.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to decipher the condensed structural formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFrom this formula, we can count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 2 (in methyls) + 1 (C=) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (in methyl) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (C=) + 2 (in methyls) = **12 Carbon atoms**.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 2*3 (in methyls) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 3 (in methyl) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 2*3 (in methyls) = **22 Hydrogen atoms**.\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number and Types of Bonds**\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of covalent bond within one molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The formula clearly shows two double bonds: C=C and CH=C. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds involving carbon is determined by the valency of carbon (4). Total bonds = (12 carbons * 4 valency) / 2 = 24 bonds. We already counted 22 C-H bonds and 2 C=C bonds. The number of single C-C bonds is the total number of carbon-carbon bonds minus the number of C=C bonds. The total number of C-C bonds (single and double) is 11. (You can confirm this by drawing the skeleton: C=C-C-C-C-C=C with 5 branches to methyl groups, for a total of 11 carbon-carbon connections).\n    Therefore, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nΔH_atomization = (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\nUsing the given bond energies:\n*   BE_C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE_C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE_C-H = 400 kJ/mol\nΔH_atomization = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atomization = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy to Form Gaseous Atoms**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states (12 moles of solid carbon, 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of gaseous carbon, 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen).\nΔH_atoms = (No. of C atoms × ΔH_atomization(C)) + (No. of H2 molecules × BE_H-H)\nUsing the given data:\n*   ΔH_atomization(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   BE_H-H = 100 kJ/mol\nΔH_atoms = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atoms = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation of the compound is the difference between the total enthalpy required to form the gaseous atoms from their elements and the enthalpy released when these atoms combine to form the molecule (which is the negative of the enthalpy of atomization).\nΔH_f = ΔH_atoms - ΔH_atomization\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include values in kJ/g. We need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass of the compound.\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.3 g/mol. (Using integer masses as implied by the problem: 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization)\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value is correct for kJ/mol, but the units are wrong)\n\nThe calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
