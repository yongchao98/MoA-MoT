    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to treat a nucleon bound inside a nucleus as if it were a free nucleon during a high-energy interaction. Let's analyze each statement in this context.\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation. The incoming probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) is assumed to interact with a single nucleon rather than with the nucleus as a whole or with the messenger particles (mesons) that bind the nucleus. This is often referred to as the \"one-body current\" approximation. If the probe interacted with multiple nucleons at once (a \"two-body current\"), the nucleons would not be behaving independently, contradicting the \"free nucleon\" picture. Therefore, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. If the incoming probe or the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) were to interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus, these \"initial-state\" and \"final-state interactions\" (ISI and FSI) would alter the kinematics of the event. The observed outcome would then depend on the nuclear environment, not just the single nucleon interaction. To treat the nucleon as truly isolated during the event, one must assume these other interactions do not happen. This is equivalent to saying the rest of the nucleus is \"transparent.\" This assumption is crucial for the simplest form of the impulse approximation (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation).\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself (i.e., its composition of quarks and gluons as described by QCD). The impulse approximation, however, is about the behavior of the *nucleon as a unit* within the nuclear medium. It simplifies the *many-body nuclear problem* into a *one-body problem*. It does not necessarily make any specific assumptions about the internal quark dynamics of the nucleon. One can apply the impulse approximation regardless of whether a relativistic or non-relativistic model is used for the nucleon's internal structure. In fact, quarks inside a nucleon are highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the essence of the \"impulse\" in the impulse approximation. The name comes from the idea that the interaction happens over an extremely short timescale, like a sudden impulse. During this brief moment, the strong nuclear forces that bind the nucleon to its neighbors are considered negligible. The nucleon is hit so hard and fast that it recoils as if it were a free particle, momentarily \"unaware\" of its binding energy and the potential from the surrounding nucleons. This assumption is central to the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction involves a single nucleon (1), this nucleon acts as if it is not bound during the brief interaction (4), and the incoming and outgoing particles do not interact with the rest of the nucleus (2). Statement (3) is an unrelated approximation about the nucleon's internal structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
