    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (called tautomers) that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton (H+). The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbon must be sp3 hybridized.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp2 hybridized (they are part of the ring's double bonds). They do not have the required sp3 hybridization for typical keto-enol tautomerism. Tautomerization would involve creating a highly unstable structure or a different compound (hydroquinone) via a redox reaction, not a simple proton shift equilibrium. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons and Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp3 hybridized and are adjacent to two carbonyl groups each. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, the molecule can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It tautomerizes to form its enol form, which is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and extremely stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form. Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows extensive tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The central carbon (at position 2) is bonded to the following four groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since all four groups attached to the central carbon are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid (CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center), which makes it achiral. An achiral molecule cannot be optically active. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   Compound (A) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound (B) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
