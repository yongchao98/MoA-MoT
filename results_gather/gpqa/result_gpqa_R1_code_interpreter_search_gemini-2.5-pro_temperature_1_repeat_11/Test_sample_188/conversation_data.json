    "Goldstone's theorem states that whenever a continuous global symmetry is spontaneously broken, a massless (or light, if the symmetry is explicitly broken as well) particle appears in the spectrum of possible excitations. These particles are called Goldstone bosons or Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Magnon**: In a ferromagnet, the ground state has all spins aligned in a particular direction, spontaneously breaking the global spin-rotation symmetry of the system. The low-energy excitations are collective spin waves, and their quanta are called magnons. Therefore, magnons are the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken spin-rotation symmetry.\n\n2.  **Phonon**: In a crystalline solid, the atoms are arranged in a regular lattice. The ground state of the crystal is not invariant under continuous translations, as the underlying laws of physics are. This spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry leads to the existence of Goldstone bosons, which are the acoustic phonons (quantized sound waves).\n\n3.  **Pion**: In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics), for massless up and down quarks, there is an approximate global symmetry called chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum, giving rise to three nearly massless Goldstone bosons, which are identified with the three pions (π⁺, π⁻, π⁰). They are not exactly massless because the chiral symmetry is also slightly explicitly broken by the small masses of the quarks.\n\n4.  **Skyrmion**: A Skyrmion is not a fundamental particle or a quantum of a field in the same way as the others. It is a topological soliton, which is a stable, localized, particle-like solution to the non-linear equations of motion of a field theory. In nuclear physics, Skyrmions can be used to model baryons (like protons and neutrons) as topological configurations of a pion field (which itself is associated with broken symmetry). However, the Skyrmion itself is not the Goldstone boson. It is a massive, non-linear excitation, distinct from the massless (or light) Goldstone bosons (the pions) that arise from the broken symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the Skyrmion is the particle/object in the list that is not a Goldstone boson associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
