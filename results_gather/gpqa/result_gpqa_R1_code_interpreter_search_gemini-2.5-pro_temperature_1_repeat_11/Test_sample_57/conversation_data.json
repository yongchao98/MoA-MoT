    "*   **Analyze the Question:** The question asks which of the listed physical theories does not require \"regularization at high energies.\" This refers to the problem of ultraviolet (UV) divergences, which are infinities that appear in calculations involving interactions at very short distances (or equivalently, very high energies). Regularization is a mathematical technique used to manage these infinities.\n\n*   **Evaluate Option A (Quantum Chromodynamics - QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory (QFT) of the strong nuclear force. Like other interacting QFTs, calculations in QCD that involve virtual particles in loops (loop diagrams) lead to integrals that diverge at high energies. Therefore, QCD requires regularization (e.g., dimensional regularization, Pauli-Villars regularization) followed by renormalization to make meaningful physical predictions. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluate Option D (Quantum Electrodynamics - QED):** QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It was the first theory where the problem of high-energy divergences was successfully solved. Calculations of quantities like the electron's self-energy and vacuum polarization diverge. The techniques of regularization and renormalization were famously developed to handle these infinities in QED, making it a predictive theory. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluate Option C (Classical Electrodynamics):** This is the classical theory of electricity and magnetism described by Maxwell's equations. While it is not a quantum theory, it has its own high-energy/short-distance problem. If one considers a fundamental particle like an electron to be a point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) is infinite. This is because the energy density of the electric field is proportional to E², which goes as 1/r⁴ for a point charge. Integrating this energy density over all space from r=0 to infinity results in a divergent integral. This divergence comes from the r -> 0 limit (short distance/high energy). To \"fix\" this, one has to introduce a cutoff, essentially \"regularizing\" the theory by assuming the charge is not a point but has a small, finite radius. Therefore, even the classical theory has a high-energy divergence that requires a form of regularization. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluate Option B (Superstring Theory):** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity. One of its primary motivations and most celebrated features is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory. Unlike in QFTs where interactions happen at a single point in spacetime, in string theory, interactions are \"smeared out\" over a region of spacetime because the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings, not zero-dimensional points. This smearing effect smooths out the interactions at short distances and is believed to eliminate the ultraviolet divergences that plague QFTs. If string theory is indeed finite, it would not require the ad-hoc procedure of regularization to handle high-energy infinities.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the given options, Superstring Theory is the only one that is constructed in a way that is intended to be free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, and thus would not require regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
