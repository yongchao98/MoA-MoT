The speed is `c/n`. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the lab (u):** This is the quantity we need to find.

Given `c=1`, we have `n = 1 / u'`, which means `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** For collinear motion, the formula to find the velocity `u` in frame S, given the velocity `u'` in frame S' and the relative velocity `v` between the frames, is `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`. This formula is the correct one to use, as opposed to the simple classical addition of velocities.

Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\nWe need to consider two different inertial frames of reference:\n*   **S' (The Rest Frame of the Glass):** In this frame, the glass is stationary. An observer in this frame would be moving along with the glass.\n*   **S (The Laboratory Frame):** In this frame, the laboratory and the observer are stationary. The glass is observed to be moving with a constant velocity `v`.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S')**\n\n*   The definition of the index of refraction `n` of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n*   So, `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of the light beam within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'), is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n*   This velocity `u'` is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam (`u`) as measured in the laboratory frame (S). To do this, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, as the speeds involved can be close to the speed of light. The classical Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate.\n*   The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the laboratory frame (S). This is what we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S', the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S', the glass) relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n\n*   We have `u' = 1/n`.\n*   We have the velocity of the glass `v`.\n*   We have the speed of light in vacuum `c = 1`.\n\nSubstituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\n*   First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n*   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + nv/n = (1 + nv) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n*   Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + nv) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n*   The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n**6.

The problem involves the speed of light, which is the domain of special relativity.\n*   **Frame Identification:** Correctly identifying which speed belongs to which frame of reference (`u'` in the glass's frame, `v` for the glass's motion, `u` in the lab frame) is the key to setting up the problem correctly.\n*   **Sign Convention:** Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, both `u'` and `v` are positive. If they were moving in opposite directions, one would be negative.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Be careful when simplifying the complex fraction to arrive at the final form. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the main fraction by `n` is an efficient way to simplify.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame that is at rest with respect to the glass.

Given `c=1`, we have `n = 1 / u'`, which means `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** For collinear motion, the formula to find the velocity `u` in frame S, given the velocity `u'` in frame S' and the relative velocity `v` between the frames, is `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`. This formula is the correct one to use, as opposed to the simple classical addition of velocities.

Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\nWe need to consider two different inertial frames of reference:\n*   **S' (The Rest Frame of the Glass):** In this frame, the glass is stationary. An observer in this frame would be moving along with the glass.\n*   **S (The Laboratory Frame):** In this frame, the laboratory and the observer are stationary. The glass is observed to be moving with a constant velocity `v`.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S')**\n\n*   The definition of the index of refraction `n` of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n*   So, `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of the light beam within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'), is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n*   This velocity `u'` is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam (`u`) as measured in the laboratory frame (S). To do this, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, as the speeds involved can be close to the speed of light. The classical Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate.\n*   The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the laboratory frame (S).

The problem involves the speed of light, which is the domain of special relativity.\n*   **Frame Identification:** Correctly identifying which speed belongs to which frame of reference (`u'` in the glass's frame, `v` for the glass's motion, `u` in the lab frame) is the key to setting up the problem correctly.\n*   **Sign Convention:** Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, both `u'` and `v` are positive. If they were moving in opposite directions, one would be negative.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Be careful when simplifying the complex fraction to arrive at the final form.

    "<information>The Fizeau experiment, conducted by French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau in 1851, was a pivotal experiment designed to measure the speed of light in moving water. At the time, it was believed that a moving medium would drag light along with it, and the experiment aimed to detect this \"aether drag.\"\n\nThe experimental setup involved splitting a beam of light, sending the two resulting beams through separate tubes of water that were flowing in opposite directions. An interferometer was used to observe the interference pattern created when the two beams were recombined. By analyzing the shift in this interference pattern, Fizeau could measure the effect of the moving water on the speed of light.\n\nThe results of the experiment were significant. Fizeau did observe that the speed of light was faster when traveling in the same direction as the water and slower when moving in the opposite direction. However, the magnitude of this change was much smaller than what was predicted by the simple addition of the water's velocity to the speed of light. This indicated that the \"aether\" was only partially dragged along by the moving water.\n\nThe Fizeau experiment provided crucial early evidence supporting the wave theory of light. It was also considered by Albert Einstein to be a critical experiment in distinguishing between the older Newtonian concept of velocity addition and the principles of his Special Theory of Relativity. The experiment's findings were later explained by the relativistic Doppler effect.\n\nIt is worth noting that Hippolyte Fizeau conducted a variety of experiments related to the speed of light. In a separate experiment between 1848 and 1849, he made the first terrestrial measurement of the speed of light in air using a rotating cogwheel and a distant mirror.\nExtra search: 1: The Fizeau experiment was carried out by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1851 to measure the relative speeds of light in moving water.
