  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nResearchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:\n\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The core task is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2 to decide which is the better target for observation.\n\n2.  **State the Relevant Physics:**\n    *   **Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n        `p = R_s / a`\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). The relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n        `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n        Therefore, `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** We need to find the ratio of the probability for Planet_1 (`p₁`) to that of Planet_2 (`p₂`).\n    `p₁ / p₂ = (R_s1 / a₁) / (R_s2 / a₂)`\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    `p₁ / p₂ = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a₂ / a₁)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Known Information:**\n    *   The problem states that the host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`. This means the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n    *   The probability ratio simplifies to the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio:\n        `p₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`.\n    `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * P₂²) / (M_s1 * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the Specifics from the Question:**\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    *   The period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3`, which means `P₂ = 3 * P₁`.\n    *   Substitute these into the ratio:\n        `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P₁)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P₁²) / (2 * M_s2 * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   The terms `M_s2` and `P₁²` cancel out.\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value and Conclude:**\n    *   The ratio of the probabilities `p₁ / p₂` is equal to `(4.5)^(1/3)`.\n    *   Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives approximately `1.65`.\n    *   `p₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65`\n    *   This result means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n9.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\n    *   D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n\nThe analysis shows that almost all candidate answers correctly derived the numerical value of ~1.65 but many failed to select the correct corresponding option. The correct derivation and conclusion lead to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is the better target for observation and by what factor.\n\n**2. Identify the Core Physics Principles**\n*   **Transit Probability:** For a planet with a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit (`p_transit`) is the ratio of the host star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `p_transit ≈ R_s / a`\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). The relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n    Solving for `a`, we get:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Probabilities**\nWe need to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`p_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`p_2`):\n`p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\nThis can be rearranged to:\n`p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Information**\nThe problem provides the following relationships:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`. This means the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the star hosting Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`.\n\nSubstituting `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1` into the probability ratio simplifies the equation to:\n`p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`\nThis shows that the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the known relationships for mass and period:\n*   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`\n*   `P_1 = P_2 / 3`\n\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (P_2 / 3)² ) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / ( 2 * M_s2 * P_2² / 9 ) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `M_s2` and `P_2²` terms cancel out from the numerator and denominator:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2 / 9) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value and Conclude**\nThe ratio of the probabilities `p_1 / p_2` is equal to `a_2 / a_1`, which is `(4.5)^(1/3)`.\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n`(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096`\n\nTherefore, the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. This means the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect factor)\n*   B) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\n*   C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect planet and factor)\n*   D) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.

Set up the ratio of the transit probabilities: `P_transit1 / P_transit2`.\n    b.  Use Kepler's Third Law to express the semi-major axis (`a`) in terms of the given quantities (`T` and `M_s`).\n    c.  Substitute the expression for `a` into the probability ratio.\n    d.  Plug in the specific relationships given in the problem for the two planets' systems.\n    e.  Simplify the resulting expression to get a numerical ratio.\n    f.  Compare this ratio to the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step a & b:** Start with the probability ratio and substitute for `a`.\n        `P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a2 / a1)`\n        From Kepler's Law, `a³ ∝ M_s * T²`, so `a ∝ (M_s * T²)^(1/3)`.\n        The ratio `a2 / a1` is therefore:\n        `a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * T2²) / (M_s1 * T1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n    *   **Step c:** Substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the probability ratio:\n        `P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [ (M_s2 * T2²) / (M_s1 * T1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n    *   **Step d:** Plug in the given relationships:\n        *   `R_s1 = R_s2`  => `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n        *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` => `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`\n        *   `T1 = T2 / 3`   => `T2 / T1 = 3`\n\n        Substitute these into the equation:\n        `P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (1) * [ (1/2) * (3)² ]^(1/3)`\n\n    *   **Step e:** Simplify the expression:\n        `P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)`\n        `P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n        `P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n    *   **Step f:** Calculate the numerical value and choose the correct option. The ratio is greater than 1, so Planet_1 is preferred. The value `(4.5)^(1/3)` is approximately 1.65.

Set up the Ratio of Probabilities**\nWe want to find the ratio of the probability for Planet_1 (`P_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`P_2`):\n`P_1 / P_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\nThis can be rearranged as:\n`P_1 / P_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n**4. Incorporate the Given Information**\nLet's list the relationships provided in the problem:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`. This means the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n*   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `T_1 = T_2 / 3`.\n\nSubstituting `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1` into our probability ratio simplifies the equation significantly:\n`P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1`\nThis is a critical point: the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**5. Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nFirst, let's rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n`a³ ∝ M_s * T²`\n`a ∝ (M_s * T²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * T_2²) / (M_s1 * T_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n**6.

We need to calculate the ratio of their probabilities, `p_1 / p_2`.\n\n**2. Identify the Key Formulas**\n*   **Transit Probability (p):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_star`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `p ∝ R_star / a`\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`T`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_star`). The relationship can be expressed as a proportionality:\n    `T² ∝ a³ / M_star`\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio of Probabilities**\nLet's write the probability for each planet and then find their ratio:\n*   `p_1 ∝ R_1 / a_1`\n*   `p_2 ∝ R_2 / a_2`\n*   Ratio: `p_1 / p_2 = (R_1 / a_1) / (R_2 / a_2) = (R_1 / R_2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information to Simplify the Ratio**\nThe problem states that both host stars have the same radii: `R_1 = R_2`.\nTherefore, the term `R_1 / R_2` equals 1, and the ratio simplifies to:\n`p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / a_1`\nThis means the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**5.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2 to decide which one has a higher chance of being observed transiting its star and by what factor.\n\n**2. The Formula for Transit Probability**\nFor a planet with a circular orbit, the geometric probability (`p_transit`) of it transiting its host star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n*   `p_transit ≈ R_s / a`\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio of Probabilities**\nTo compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities (`p₁` for Planet_1 and `p₂` for Planet_2).\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = (R_s1 / a₁) / (R_s2 / a₂)`\n*   This can be rearranged to: `p₁ / p₂ = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a₂ / a₁)`\n\n**4. Incorporate Given Information**\nThe problem states that the host stars have the same radii (`R_s1 = R_s2`). Therefore, the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2` is equal to 1. The probability ratio simplifies to the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁`\n\n**5. Use Kepler's Third Law**\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a₂ / a₁`), we must use Kepler's Third Law. This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`).\n*   `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n*   `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n*   `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can set up the ratio for `a₂ / a₁`:\n*   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * P₂²) / (M_s1 * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n**7. Substitute the Known Relationships**\nThe problem provides the following relationships:\n*   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`. This gives `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n*   The period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3`. This gives `P₂ / P₁ = 3`, and `(P₂ / P₁)² = 9`.\n\nNow, substitute these values into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n*   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 / M_s1) * (P₂ / P₁)² ]^(1/3)`\n*   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)`\n*   `a₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n**8.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is the better target for observation. We need to calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Transit Probability**\nFor a planet with a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star (`P_transit`) is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n`P_transit = R_s / a`\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio of Probabilities**\nTo compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`P_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`P_2`):\n`P_1 / P_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\nThis can be rearranged as:\n`P_1 / P_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\nThe problem provides the following relationships:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`. This means the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `T_1 = T_2 / 3`, which means `T_2 / T_1 = 3`.\n*   The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, which means `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n\nSubstituting `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1` into the probability ratio simplifies the equation to:\n`P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1`\nThis shows that the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**5. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates a planet's orbital period (`T`), semi-major axis (`a`), and the host star's mass (`M_s`):\n`T² ∝ a³ / M_s`\nRearranging to solve for `a`, we get:\n`a³ ∝ M_s * T²`\n`a ∝ (M_s * T²)^(1/3)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nNow we can express the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * T_2²) / (M_s1 * T_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n**7. Substitute Known Values and Simplify**\nPlug the relationships for mass and period into the equation:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 / M_s1) * (T_2 / T_1)² ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (1/2) * (3)² ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n**8. Determine the Final Probability Ratio**\nSince `P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1`, the ratio of the probabilities is:\n`P_1 / P_2 = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096`\n\n**9.

Therefore, the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2` is equal to 1.\n    *   The probability ratio simplifies to: `p_t1 / p_t2 = a₂ / a₁`\n    *   This shows that the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their orbital semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`).\n    *   `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n    *   Rearranging to solve for `a`, we get: `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n    *   Therefore, `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can express the ratio `a₂ / a₁` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods.\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * P₂²) / (M_s1 * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute Known Relationships:** We are given the following information:\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    *   The period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3`, which means `P₂ = 3 * P₁`.\n    *   Substitute these into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n        `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P₁)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P₁²) / (2 * M_s2 * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   The terms `M_s2` and `P₁²` cancel out from the numerator and denominator.\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The ratio of the probabilities `p_t1 / p_t2` is equal to `a₂ / a₁`. We calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n    *   `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096`\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The ratio `p_t1 / p_t2` is approximately 1.65.

This will allow us to choose the correct option from the list.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Geometric Transit Probability (`p`):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). The formula is `p = R_s / a`.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). The relationship can be expressed as a proportionality: `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    a.  First, I will set up the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 (`p₁`) and Planet_2 (`p₂`). This ratio is `p₁ / p₂`.\n    b.  Using the formula for transit probability, I will express this ratio in terms of the stellar radii and semi-major axes: `p₁ / p₂ = (R_s1 / a₁) / (R_s2 / a₂) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a₂ / a₁)`.\n    c.  Next, I will use Kepler's Third Law to find an expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a₂ / a₁`) in terms of the given quantities (stellar mass `M_s` and orbital period `P`). Rearranging Kepler's law gives `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.\n    d.  I will substitute the given relationships from the problem into the equations. The problem states:\n        *   `R_s1 = R_s2` (The stars have the same radii).\n        *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (Star 1 is twice as massive as Star 2).\n        *   `P₁ = P₂ / 3` (Planet 1's period is one-third of Planet 2's).\n    e.  Finally, I will simplify the expression to calculate the numerical value of the probability ratio `p₁ / p₂` and compare it to the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    *   The probability ratio `p₁ / p₂ = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a₂ / a₁)`. Since `R_s1 = R_s2`, this simplifies to `p₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁`.\n    *   The ratio of semi-major axes is `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * P₂²) / (M_s1 * P₁²) ]^(1/3)`.\n    *   Let's substitute the known relationships: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` and `P₁ = P₂ / 3`.\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * P₂²) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (P₂ / 3)² ) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   `a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * P₂²) / ( 2 * M_s2 * P₂² / 9 ) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   The `M_s2` and `P₂²` terms cancel out, leaving `a₂ / a₁ = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`.\n    *   Calculating the value: `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65`.\n    *   Since `p₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65`, this means Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.

Incorporate the Given Information**\nLet's list the relationships provided in the problem:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`. This means the ratio `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n*   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n*   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `T_1 = T_2 / 3`.\n\nSubstituting `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1` into our probability ratio simplifies the equation significantly:\n`P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1`\nThis is a critical point: the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**5. Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nFirst, let's rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n`a³ ∝ M_s * T²`\n`a ∝ (M_s * T²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * T_2²) / (M_s1 * T_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n**6. Substitute the Known Relationships and Calculate**\nLet's plug the given mass and period relationships into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n*   Substitute `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n*   Substitute `T_1 = T_2 / 3`.\n\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * T_2²) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (T_2 / 3)² ) ]^(1/3)`\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * T_2²) / ( 2 * M_s2 * T_2² / 9 ) ]^(1/3)`\n\nThe terms `M_s2` and `T_2²` cancel out from the numerator and denominator:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2 / 9) ]^(1/3)`\n\nInvert the fraction inside the cube root:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n**7.
