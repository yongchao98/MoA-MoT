When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?

The problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the **Boltzmann equation** is the correct physical law to apply.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is:\n    $$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n    where `g₂` and `g₁` are statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\".

The correct physical law to use is the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n    Ratio = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   N₂/N₁ is the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper energy level (2) to the lower energy level (1).\n    *   g₂/g₁ is the ratio of the statistical weights of the levels (a constant for this transition).\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Factor of Change**: The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the ratios:\n\n    Factor = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots\n\n    Substituting the Boltzmann equation for the two temperatures (T_nospots = 6000 K and T_spots = 5500 K):\n\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, the formula simplifies to:\n\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n    This can be rearranged to a more convenient form for calculation:\n\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**: The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å. We use the Planck-Einstein relation, ΔE = hc/λ.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Using appropriate constants.** To simplify calculations, it's best to use constants with consistent units. Using electron-volts (eV) for energy is common in atomic physics.\n        *   λ = 1448 Å\n        *   The product hc (Planck's constant times the speed of light) is approximately 12400 eV·Å.\n        *   ΔE = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: Now we substitute all the values into the factor equation.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Using the correct Boltzmann constant.** Since we used eV for energy, we must use the Boltzmann constant in eV/K.\n        *   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n        *   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n        *   T_spots = 5500 K\n        *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\n    First, calculate the term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n\n    Next, calculate the temperature term:\n    (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n\n    Now, calculate the full exponent:\n    Exponent = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\n    Finally, calculate the factor:\n    Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Final Check**:\n    *   The calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Extraneous Information.** The star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage are contextual details not needed for the calculation, as the initial and final effective temperatures are given directly.\n    *   **Sanity Check**: The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots appear (i.e., as temperature drops). Our factor is `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`. Since the temperature without spots is higher, its ratio should be larger, meaning the factor must be greater than 1. Our result of ~4.5 is consistent with this.\n    *   Comparing our result with the given options:\n        A) ~2.9\n        B) ~1.1\n        C) ~4.5\n        D) ~7.8\n    *   The calculated value of ~4.5 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves the population of atomic energy levels at different temperatures, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The governing principle is the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The goal is to find the factor by which the population ratio changes. This factor is the ratio of the population ratio at the \"no spots\" temperature (6000 K) to the population ratio at the \"with spots\" temperature (5500 K).\n3.  **Calculate Necessary Values:** The energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels must be calculated from the given transition wavelength (1448 Å) using the Planck-Einstein relation (ΔE = hc/λ).\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** A Python script will be used to perform the calculation using precise values for physical constants to avoid rounding errors.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated numerical result will be compared against the given options (A, B, C, D) to determine the correct choice.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio `R` of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (`N₂`) to a lower energy level (`N₁`) is:\n    `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g` represents statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **The Factor:** We need to find the factor `F = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n    *   `R_nospots` is the ratio at `T_nospots = 6000 K`.\n    *   `R_spots` is the ratio at `T_spots = 5500 K`.\n\n    `F = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_spots)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weights `(g₂/g₁)` cancel out. Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`, the formula simplifies to:\n\n    `F = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n    This can be rearranged to avoid a negative sign in the final exponent:\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n3.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature). Our formula for `R = N₂/N₁` shows that as `T` decreases, the negative exponent `-ΔE/(kT)` becomes more negative, so `exp()` decreases. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n    *   The factor `F` must be greater than 1, since `R_nospots` (at a higher T) is larger than `R_spots` (at a lower T).\n    *   The star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage are extraneous details, as the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided directly.\n    *   The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the numerical result (~4.5) but are highly inconsistent in mapping this result to the correct letter option.

Specifically, it's the ratio of the population ratio of two Ti energy levels in the unspotted (hotter) state compared to the spotted (cooler) state.\n    Factor = (Population Ratio at T_nospots) / (Population Ratio at T_spots)\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means the relative populations of atomic energy levels are governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n3.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Factor:** Let's set up the ratio of the ratios for the two temperatures:\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we get:\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n    This can be rearranged to avoid a double negative, which is a common source of error:\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å.\n    *   First, convert the wavelength to a more convenient unit, like nanometers: λ = 144.8 nm.\n    *   A very useful constant in astrophysics is hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n    *   ΔE = hc / λ ≈ 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Exponent:** Now we can calculate the value of the exponent in the formula for the factor. It's often easier to first calculate the term ΔE/k.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant in these units is k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K.\n    *   Now, calculate the temperature difference term:\n        (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K)\n        = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) K⁻¹\n        = 500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹\n        = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n    *   The full exponent is:\n        Exponent = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Factor:**\n    *   Factor = e^(Exponent) = e^(1.5057)\n    *   Factor ≈ 4.507\n\n8.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated factor is approximately 4.5.

A common mistake is inverting this or making a sign error in the exponent. The fact that the population ratio *decreases* with temperature confirms that the factor must be greater than 1.\n*   **Consistency of Units:** All calculations must use a consistent set of units (either SI or eV/nm/K). Using the eV-based constants is often quicker for this type of problem.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly identify the method and perform the calculation to arrive at a numerical result of ~4.5.

Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the factor by which the population ratio of two energy levels of neutral Titanium changes when the star's temperature changes. This factor is the ratio of the population ratio in the unspotted (hotter) state to the population ratio in the spotted (cooler) state.\n\nFactor = (Population Ratio at 6000 K) / (Population Ratio at 5500 K)\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Physical Law\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This assumption allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels. The equation is:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Calculation for the Factor\nLet R(T) be the population ratio at a given temperature T. The factor we need to calculate is:\n\nFactor = R(T_nospots) / R(T_spots)\n\nFactor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ/eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, the expression simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\nThis can be rewritten to avoid a negative sign in the final exponent:\n\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n### 4. List Careful Points and Key Values\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and spot coverage (40%) are not needed for the calculation because the resulting effective temperatures for both scenarios are given directly.\n*   **Temperatures**:\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   **Wavelength**: The transition wavelength is λ = 1448 Å. This is needed to find the energy difference ΔE.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature). Our formula for the population ratio, R ∝ exp(-ΔE/kT), shows that as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so R decreases. This is consistent. Therefore, the factor we are calculating (R_nospots / R_spots) must be greater than 1.\n\n### 5.

The problem provides all the necessary information to solve this using fundamental principles of statistical mechanics in astrophysics.\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Physical Law:**\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a critical piece of information, as it justifies the use of the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nwhere:\n*   `N₂ / N₁` is the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (2) to the lower energy level (1).\n*   `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of the statistical weights of the levels, a constant for a given transition.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Define the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the \"factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This translates to calculating the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures:\n\nFactor = `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`\n\nLet `T_nospots` = 6000 K and `T_spots` = 5500 K.\n\nFactor = `[ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\n**3. Simplify the Expression:**\nThe term for the statistical weights `(g₂ / g₁)` is a constant that cancels out. Using the property of exponents `eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ`, the expression simplifies to:\n\nFactor = `exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\nThis can be rewritten to avoid a double negative in the calculation:\nFactor = `exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):**\nThe energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. The relationship is `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   It is computationally easier to work with electron-volts (eV). The product `h*c` is approximately `1240 eV·nm`.\n*   The wavelength `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n*   `ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`.\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation:**\nNow, we substitute the known values into the simplified factor equation.\n\n*   `ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n*   The Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K`.\n*   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n*   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n\nFirst, calculate the term `ΔE / k`:\n`ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K`\n\nNext, calculate the temperature term:\n`1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots = 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹`\n\nNow, combine them to find the exponent:\nExponent = `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057`\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\nFactor = `exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the spot coverage percentage (40%) are not needed for the calculation. They provide context but are distractors, as the relevant initial and final effective temperatures are given directly.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The problem states that the ratio *decreases* when the star has spots (i.s., is cooler). Our calculation shows that the ratio at the hotter temperature (6000 K) is ~4.5 times larger than the ratio at the cooler temperature (5500 K). This is consistent with the problem's description.\n*   **Numerical Result:** The calculation robustly yields a value of approximately 4.5.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~4.5 must be compared to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) ~4.5\n    B) ~1.1\n    C) ~7.8\n    D) ~2.9\n\nThe calculated factor of ~4.5 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physics and Formula\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the problem requires the use of the **Boltzmann equation**, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The factor by which the population ratio changes between two temperatures is derived from this equation.\n\nThe ratio of populations (N₂/N₁) at a temperature T is:\n`Ratio(T) = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nThe factor of change between the unspotted (hotter) and spotted (cooler) states is:\n`Factor = Ratio(T_nospots) / Ratio(T_spots)`\n\nThis simplifies to the formula used by all agents:\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Calculation Steps\n\nThe calculation involves three main parts:\n1.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE)** from the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å).\n    *   Using the relation `ΔE = hc/λ`, all agents correctly calculate `ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV` or the equivalent in Joules.\n2.  **Identify the temperatures.**\n    *   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n3.  **Substitute the values into the factor formula.**\n    *   The exponent is calculated as `(ΔE / k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)`.\n    *   `ΔE/k ≈ 99400 K` (with minor variations depending on the constants used).\n    *   `1/5500 - 1/6000 = 1/66000 K⁻¹`.\n    *   `Exponent ≈ 99400 / 66000 ≈ 1.506`.\n    *   `Factor = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Consistency of the Results\n\nEvery single candidate answer, regardless of the specific constants used or the format of the explanation (text vs. code), arrives at the same numerical result: **the factor is approximately 4.5**. This unanimous agreement on the numerical result provides very high confidence in the calculation.\n\n### Step 4: Address Careful Points and Discrepancies\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** All agents correctly ignored the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage, as the effective temperatures for the two scenarios were given directly. This is a crucial step in correctly interpreting the problem.\n*   **Qualitative Check:** The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature). A hotter gas will have more atoms in higher energy states. Therefore, the ratio of (upper level / lower level) should be higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K. The factor, calculated as `Ratio_6000K / Ratio_5500K`, must be greater than 1. The result of ~4.5 is consistent with this physical reasoning.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The only discrepancy among the answers is the final letter chosen (A, B, C, or D). This is because the options were presented in a different order to different agents. However, the numerical value `~4.5` is consistently identified as the correct answer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation is robust and the physical reasoning is sound across all provided answers.

The factor is defined as the ratio in the unspotted state divided by the ratio in the spotted state.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Law:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is the key condition that allows the use of the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels.\n\n3.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Factor:** We need to calculate the factor `F = Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`.\n    *   Ratio_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n    *   Ratio_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n    Dividing these two expressions, the statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) cancels out:\n    F = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]\n    Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, this simplifies to:\n    F = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]\n    F = exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å.\n    *   The relationship is ΔE = h * c / λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n    *   For convenience, we can work in electron-volts (eV). The product hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm.\n    *   ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   We have ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant in these units is k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   The temperatures are T_nospots = 6000 K and T_spots = 5500 K.\n\n    First, calculate the term ΔE/k:\n    ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K.\n\n    Next, calculate the temperature-dependent part of the exponent:\n    (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹.\n\n    Now, calculate the full exponent:\n    Exponent = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057.\n\n    Finally, calculate the factor F:\n    F = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage are contextual details not needed for the calculation, as the initial and final effective temperatures are provided.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The problem states the ratio decreases when the star has spots (is cooler). Our calculation shows that the ratio at 6000 K is 4.5 times larger than the ratio at 5500 K, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n*   **Candidate Analysis:** The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly identify the method and perform the calculation, arriving at a numerical result of ~4.5.

The key assumption is that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the distribution of atoms across energy levels is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the Factor**: The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the population ratios:\n    Factor = (Ratio at T_nospots) / (Ratio at T_spots)\n    Let T_nospots = 6000 K and T_spots = 5500 K.\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression**: The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, the expression simplifies to:\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n    This can be rearranged to avoid a double negative:\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n### Careful Points and Calculation\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the spot coverage percentage (40%) are not needed for the calculation, as the two relevant effective temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) are given directly.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature). Our formula for the ratio, `R ∝ exp(-ΔE / kT)`, shows that as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio R decreases. This is consistent. The factor we are calculating (`Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`) should therefore be greater than 1.\n*   **Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)**: The energy difference corresponds to the transition wavelength λ = 1448 Å. It is most convenient to work in electron-volts (eV).\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n    *   The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. A useful constant is hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n    *   ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n*   **Calculating the Exponent**: Now we can calculate the full exponent for our factor equation.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant in these units is k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   First, calculate the term ΔE/k:\n        ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n    *   Next, calculate the temperature term:\n        (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n    *   Multiply the two parts to get the exponent:\n        Exponent ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\n*   **Final Factor Calculation**:\n    *   Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) ~7.8\nB) ~4.5\nC) ~2.9\nD) ~1.1\n\nThe calculated value matches option B. All candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at this numerical result, even if they sometimes mapped it to the wrong letter in their own lists.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for a factor. Specifically, it's the ratio of the atomic level populations in the unspotted state divided by the ratio of the atomic level populations in the spotted state.\nFactor = (Population Ratio)<sub>unspotted</sub> / (Population Ratio)<sub>spotted</sub>\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Physical Law\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a critical piece of information, as it allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels. The equation is:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Factor\nLet's write the Boltzmann equation for the two temperatures:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nRatio<sub>nospots</sub> = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\nRatio<sub>spots</sub> = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\nThe factor we need to find is the ratio of these two expressions:\nFactor = Ratio<sub>nospots</sub> / Ratio<sub>spots</sub>\n\nWhen we divide these, the term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancels out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we get:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n### 4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)\nThe energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å. The formula is ΔE = hc/λ.\n\nIt is most convenient to work with units of electron-volts (eV) for energy.\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n*   The product hc (Planck's constant times the speed of light) is approximately 1240 eV·nm.\n\nΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n### 5. Perform the Final Calculation\nNow we can substitute the known values into our formula for the factor.\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\nFirst, calculate the term ΔE/k:\nΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n\nNext, calculate the temperature term:\n(1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n\nNow, multiply these two parts to find the exponent:\nExponent = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\nFactor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\n### 6. Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   **Calculation Result**: The calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n*   **Matching with Options**: This result matches option D.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the spot coverage percentage (40%) are not needed for the calculation.

Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, the formula simplifies to:\n\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n    This can be rearranged to a more convenient form for calculation:\n\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**: The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å. We use the Planck-Einstein relation, ΔE = hc/λ.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Using appropriate constants.** To simplify calculations, it's best to use constants with consistent units. Using electron-volts (eV) for energy is common in atomic physics.\n        *   λ = 1448 Å\n        *   The product hc (Planck's constant times the speed of light) is approximately 12400 eV·Å.\n        *   ΔE = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: Now we substitute all the values into the factor equation.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Using the correct Boltzmann constant.** Since we used eV for energy, we must use the Boltzmann constant in eV/K.\n        *   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n        *   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n        *   T_spots = 5500 K\n        *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\n    First, calculate the term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n\n    Next, calculate the temperature term:\n    (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n\n    Now, calculate the full exponent:\n    Exponent = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\n    Finally, calculate the factor:\n    Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Final Check**:\n    *   The calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Extraneous Information.** The star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage are contextual details not needed for the calculation, as the initial and final effective temperatures are given directly.\n    *   **Sanity Check**: The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots appear (i.e., as temperature drops). Our factor is `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`. Since the temperature without spots is higher, its ratio should be larger, meaning the factor must be greater than 1.

The governing principle is the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The goal is to find the factor by which the population ratio changes. This factor is the ratio of the population ratio at the \"no spots\" temperature (6000 K) to the population ratio at the \"with spots\" temperature (5500 K).\n3.  **Calculate Necessary Values:** The energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels must be calculated from the given transition wavelength (1448 Å) using the Planck-Einstein relation (ΔE = hc/λ).\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** A Python script will be used to perform the calculation using precise values for physical constants to avoid rounding errors.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated numerical result will be compared against the given options (A, B, C, D) to determine the correct choice.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio `R` of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (`N₂`) to a lower energy level (`N₁`) is:\n    `R = N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g` represents statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **The Factor:** We need to find the factor `F = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n    *   `R_nospots` is the ratio at `T_nospots = 6000 K`.\n    *   `R_spots` is the ratio at `T_spots = 5500 K`.\n\n    `F = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_spots)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weights `(g₂/g₁)` cancel out. Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`, the formula simplifies to:\n\n    `F = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n    This can be rearranged to avoid a negative sign in the final exponent:\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n3.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature). Our formula for `R = N₂/N₁` shows that as `T` decreases, the negative exponent `-ΔE/(kT)` becomes more negative, so `exp()` decreases. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n    *   The factor `F` must be greater than 1, since `R_nospots` (at a higher T) is larger than `R_spots` (at a lower T).\n    *   The star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage are extraneous details, as the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided directly.\n    *   The candidate answers show a strong consensus on the numerical result (~4.5) but are highly inconsistent in mapping this result to the correct letter option.

Specifically, it's the ratio of the population ratio of two Ti energy levels in the unspotted (hotter) state compared to the spotted (cooler) state.\n    Factor = (Population Ratio at T_nospots) / (Population Ratio at T_spots)\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem states the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means the relative populations of atomic energy levels are governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n3.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Factor:** Let's set up the ratio of the ratios for the two temperatures:\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we get:\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n    This can be rearranged to avoid a double negative, which is a common source of error:\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å.\n    *   First, convert the wavelength to a more convenient unit, like nanometers: λ = 144.8 nm.\n    *   A very useful constant in astrophysics is hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n    *   ΔE = hc / λ ≈ 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Exponent:** Now we can calculate the value of the exponent in the formula for the factor.

Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the factor by which the population ratio of two energy levels of neutral Titanium changes when the star's temperature changes. This factor is the ratio of the population ratio in the unspotted (hotter) state to the population ratio in the spotted (cooler) state.\n\nFactor = (Population Ratio at 6000 K) / (Population Ratio at 5500 K)\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Physical Law\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This assumption allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels. The equation is:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Calculation for the Factor\nLet R(T) be the population ratio at a given temperature T. The factor we need to calculate is:\n\nFactor = R(T_nospots) / R(T_spots)\n\nFactor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ/eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, the expression simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\nThis can be rewritten to avoid a negative sign in the final exponent:\n\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n### 4. List Careful Points and Key Values\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and spot coverage (40%) are not needed for the calculation because the resulting effective temperatures for both scenarios are given directly.\n*   **Temperatures**:\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   **Wavelength**: The transition wavelength is λ = 1448 Å. This is needed to find the energy difference ΔE.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature). Our formula for the population ratio, R ∝ exp(-ΔE/kT), shows that as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so R decreases. This is consistent. Therefore, the factor we are calculating (R_nospots / R_spots) must be greater than 1.\n\n### 5.

The problem provides all the necessary information to solve this using fundamental principles of statistical mechanics in astrophysics.\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Physical Law:**\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a critical piece of information, as it justifies the use of the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\n`N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nwhere:\n*   `N₂ / N₁` is the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (2) to the lower energy level (1).\n*   `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of the statistical weights of the levels, a constant for a given transition.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Define the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the \"factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This translates to calculating the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures:\n\nFactor = `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`\n\nLet `T_nospots` = 6000 K and `T_spots` = 5500 K.\n\nFactor = `[ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n\n**3. Simplify the Expression:**\nThe term for the statistical weights `(g₂ / g₁)` is a constant that cancels out. Using the property of exponents `eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ`, the expression simplifies to:\n\nFactor = `exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\nThis can be rewritten to avoid a double negative in the calculation:\nFactor = `exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):**\nThe energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. The relationship is `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   It is computationally easier to work with electron-volts (eV). The product `h*c` is approximately `1240 eV·nm`.\n*   The wavelength `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n*   `ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`.\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation:**\nNow, we substitute the known values into the simplified factor equation.\n\n*   `ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n*   The Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K`.\n*   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n*   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n\nFirst, calculate the term `ΔE / k`:\n`ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K`\n\nNext, calculate the temperature term:\n`1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots = 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹`\n\nNow, combine them to find the exponent:\nExponent = `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057`\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\nFactor = `exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the spot coverage percentage (40%) are not needed for the calculation. They provide context but are distractors, as the relevant initial and final effective temperatures are given directly.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The problem states that the ratio *decreases* when the star has spots (i.s., is cooler). Our calculation shows that the ratio at the hotter temperature (6000 K) is ~4.5 times larger than the ratio at the cooler temperature (5500 K). This is consistent with the problem's description.\n*   **Numerical Result:** The calculation robustly yields a value of approximately 4.5.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~4.5 must be compared to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) ~4.5\n    B) ~1.1\n    C) ~7.8\n    D) ~2.9\n\nThe calculated factor of ~4.5 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physics and Formula\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the problem requires the use of the **Boltzmann equation**, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The factor by which the population ratio changes between two temperatures is derived from this equation.\n\nThe ratio of populations (N₂/N₁) at a temperature T is:\n`Ratio(T) = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nThe factor of change between the unspotted (hotter) and spotted (cooler) states is:\n`Factor = Ratio(T_nospots) / Ratio(T_spots)`\n\nThis simplifies to the formula used by all agents:\n`Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]`\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Calculation Steps\n\nThe calculation involves three main parts:\n1.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE)** from the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å).\n    *   Using the relation `ΔE = hc/λ`, all agents correctly calculate `ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV` or the equivalent in Joules.\n2.  **Identify the temperatures.**\n    *   `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spots = 5500 K`\n3.  **Substitute the values into the factor formula.**\n    *   The exponent is calculated as `(ΔE / k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)`.\n    *   `ΔE/k ≈ 99400 K` (with minor variations depending on the constants used).\n    *   `1/5500 - 1/6000 = 1/66000 K⁻¹`.\n    *   `Exponent ≈ 99400 / 66000 ≈ 1.506`.\n    *   `Factor = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Consistency of the Results\n\nEvery single candidate answer, regardless of the specific constants used or the format of the explanation (text vs. code), arrives at the same numerical result: **the factor is approximately 4.5**. This unanimous agreement on the numerical result provides very high confidence in the calculation.\n\n### Step 4: Address Careful Points and Discrepancies\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** All agents correctly ignored the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage, as the effective temperatures for the two scenarios were given directly. This is a crucial step in correctly interpreting the problem.\n*   **Qualitative Check:** The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature). A hotter gas will have more atoms in higher energy states. Therefore, the ratio of (upper level / lower level) should be higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K. The factor, calculated as `Ratio_6000K / Ratio_5500K`, must be greater than 1. The result of ~4.5 is consistent with this physical reasoning.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The only discrepancy among the answers is the final letter chosen (A, B, C, or D). This is because the options were presented in a different order to different agents. However, the numerical value `~4.5` is consistently identified as the correct answer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation is robust and the physical reasoning is sound across all provided answers.

We use the Planck-Einstein relation, `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n    *   It is most convenient to work in electron-volts (eV).\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n    *   The product `hc` is approximately 1240 eV·nm.\n    *   `ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   We have `ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k` is ≈ 8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   First, calculate the term `ΔE/k`:\n        `ΔE/k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K`\n    *   Next, calculate the temperature term:\n        `1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots = 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹`\n    *   Now, compute the exponent:\n        `Exponent = (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057`\n    *   Finally, calculate the factor:\n        `Factor = e^1.5057 ≈ 4.507`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage are not needed for the calculation, as the initial and final effective temperatures are given directly.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K. According to the Boltzmann equation, a lower temperature means fewer atoms are excited to the higher energy level. Therefore, the ratio `N₂/N₁` should be smaller at 5500 K than at 6000 K. The factor we calculated, `R_nospots / R_spots`, should be greater than 1, which it is (`~4.5`).

The key assumption is that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the distribution of atoms across energy levels is described by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the Factor**: The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the population ratios:\n    Factor = (Ratio at T_nospots) / (Ratio at T_spots)\n    Let T_nospots = 6000 K and T_spots = 5500 K.\n    Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression**: The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, the expression simplifies to:\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n    This can be rearranged to avoid a double negative:\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n### Careful Points and Calculation\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the spot coverage percentage (40%) are not needed for the calculation, as the two relevant effective temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) are given directly.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The problem states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature). Our formula for the ratio, `R ∝ exp(-ΔE / kT)`, shows that as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio R decreases. This is consistent. The factor we are calculating (`Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`) should therefore be greater than 1.\n*   **Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)**: The energy difference corresponds to the transition wavelength λ = 1448 Å. It is most convenient to work in electron-volts (eV).\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n    *   The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. A useful constant is hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm.\n    *   ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n*   **Calculating the Exponent**: Now we can calculate the full exponent for our factor equation.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant in these units is k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   First, calculate the term ΔE/k:\n        ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n    *   Next, calculate the temperature term:\n        (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n    *   Multiply the two parts to get the exponent:\n        Exponent ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\n*   **Final Factor Calculation**:\n    *   Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.

Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for a factor. Specifically, it's the ratio of the atomic level populations in the unspotted state divided by the ratio of the atomic level populations in the spotted state.\nFactor = (Population Ratio)<sub>unspotted</sub> / (Population Ratio)<sub>spotted</sub>\n\n### 2. Identify the Governing Physical Law\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a critical piece of information, as it allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels. The equation is:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Factor\nLet's write the Boltzmann equation for the two temperatures:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nRatio<sub>nospots</sub> = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\nRatio<sub>spots</sub> = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\nThe factor we need to find is the ratio of these two expressions:\nFactor = Ratio<sub>nospots</sub> / Ratio<sub>spots</sub>\n\nWhen we divide these, the term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancels out. Using the property of exponents eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we get:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n### 4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)\nThe energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å. The formula is ΔE = hc/λ.\n\nIt is most convenient to work with units of electron-volts (eV) for energy.\n*   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n*   The product hc (Planck's constant times the speed of light) is approximately 1240 eV·nm.\n\nΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n### 5. Perform the Final Calculation\nNow we can substitute the known values into our formula for the factor.\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\nFirst, calculate the term ΔE/k:\nΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n\nNext, calculate the temperature term:\n(1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n\nNow, multiply these two parts to find the exponent:\nExponent = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\nFactor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\n### 6.
