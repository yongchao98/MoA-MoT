Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The correct physical law to apply is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n**2. The Boltzmann Equation**\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states (`j` for the higher energy state and `i` for the lower energy state) to the temperature `T`:\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nwhere:\n*   `N_j / N_i` is the ratio of populations, which represents the \"excitation\".\n*   `g_j / g_i` is the ratio of statistical weights, a constant for the specific atomic transition.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\n**3.

The Boltzmann Equation**\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy state `j` (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i` (`N_i`):\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**3.

I will then write out the equation for each of the two stars and use the condition provided in the problem (that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2) to create a relationship between their temperatures. By simplifying this relationship and using the provided numerical values for the energy difference and the Boltzmann constant, I will derive the final equation. Finally, I will compare this derived equation to the given options to determine the correct choice.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to a lower state (`N_i`) is given by `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`, where `g` is the statistical weight, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n2.  **Apply to Stars**: Let's define the excitation ratio as `R = N_j / N_i`.\n    *   For star 1: `R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))` (where `C = g_j / g_i`)\n    *   For star 2: `R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n3.  **Use Problem Condition**: We are given `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n    *   `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n4.  **Simplify**: The constant `C` cancels out.\n    *   `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n5.  **Solve with Logarithms**: Take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides.\n    *   `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n6.  **Isolate ln(2)**: Rearrange the terms.\n    *   `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n7.  **Factor and Combine**: Factor out `(ΔE / k)` and find a common denominator for the temperature terms.\n    *   `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    *   `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n8.  **Substitute Constants**: The problem is designed such that `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J` and `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n9.  **Final Equation**:\n    *   `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n10. **Match to Options**: This derived equation matches option D.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The goal is to derive the correct equation relating the temperatures T_1 and T_2.\n# The derivation is based on the Boltzmann equation and the information given in the problem.\n\n# Step 1: The Boltzmann equation relates the excitation ratio (R) to temperature (T).\n# R = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T)), where C is a constant (g_j/g_i).\n\n# Step 2: Write the equation for each star.\n# For star 1: R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n# For star 2: R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Step 3: Use the condition from the problem: R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n# C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n# Step 4: Simplify by canceling C and taking the natural logarithm of both sides.\n# -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n# Step 5: Rearrange to solve for ln(2).\n# ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n# Step 6: Factor out (ΔE / k) and combine the fractions.\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n# ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\n# Step 7: Use the given physical constants.\n# ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\n# k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K\n# The ratio (ΔE / k) is therefore approximately 1.\n\n# Step 8: Substitute this value into the equation.\n# The final derived equation is: ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n# Step 9: Compare this result with the given options.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\",\n    \"B\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\",\n    \"C\": \"ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\",\n    \"D\": \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\"\n}\n\n# The derived equation matches the formula in option D.\ncorrect_option_letter = \"D\"\ncorrect_equation = options[correct_option_letter]\n\nprint(\"The step-by-step derivation leads to the following equation:\")\nprint(\"ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nfor letter, equation in options.items():\n    print(f\"{letter}) {equation}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe derived equation matches option {correct_option_letter}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer: {correct_option_letter}\")\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 54\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

This is the key condition that allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of atomic energy levels as a function of temperature.\n\n**2. The Boltzmann Equation**\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_i`):\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nwhere:\n*   `N_j / N_i` is the ratio of populations, which represents the \"excitation\".\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (`E_j - E_i`).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approx. 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**3. Apply the Equation to Both Stars**\nWe can write the equation for each star, using `R` to denote the excitation ratio (`N_j / N_i`):\n*   For star 1 (temperature T₁): `R₁ = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n*   For star 2 (temperature T₂): `R₂ = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n**4. Use the Condition from the Problem**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This translates to:\n`R₁ = 2 * R₂`\n\n**5. Combine and Simplify the Equations**\nSubstitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:\n`(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]`\n\nA careful point here is that the statistical weights (`g_j`, `g_i`) are properties of the iron atom's energy levels, so the ratio `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n**6. Solve for the Relationship Between Temperatures**\nTo solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`, we get:\n`-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n`-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`\n\nNow, we must carefully rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)`\n\n**7. Factor and Combine Terms**\nFactor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)`\n\nCombine the fractions in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator (`T₁ * T₂`):\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\n**8. Substitute the Given Numerical Values**\nThis is a critical step. The problem provides:\n*   Energy difference, `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`\n*   Boltzmann constant, `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n\nThe ratio `(ΔE / k)` is therefore:\n`(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\nThe problem is designed so this pre-factor simplifies to 1.\n\n**9. Final Equation and Comparison**\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n`ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n`ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\nNow, we compare this result to the given options:\nA) ln(2) = [ T₂ / T₁]\nB) ln(2) = [ (T₁ + T₂) / (T1*T2)]\nC) ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T1*T2)]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T1*T2)² ]\n\nThe derived equation matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.
