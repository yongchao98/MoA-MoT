Understand the Model and the States**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule (XY) using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels of this model are given by:\n$E_{v,J} = (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B J(J+1)$\nwhere:\n*   $v$ is the vibrational quantum number ($v = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n*   $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s)\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   $B$ is the rotational constant.\n\nThe molecule starts in its **fundamental state**, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the quantum numbers $(v, J) = (0, 0)$.\n\nThe molecule then **absorbs a photon** and transitions to a higher energy state. The question asks for the momentum of this photon for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\".\n\n**2. Interpreting the Transition**\n\nThe phrase \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" can be ambiguous.\n*   A literal interpretation would mean the state with energy just above the ground state, which is the first rotational state $(v, J) = (0, 1)$. The energy for this transition would be $\\Delta E = E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = 2B$.\n*   However, the process is specified as **photon absorption**. This physical process is governed by selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule (like XY), the infrared absorption selection rules are $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$.\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $(v, J) = (0, 0)$:\n*   $\\Delta v = +1 \\implies v_{final} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$. Since $J$ cannot be negative, only $\\Delta J = +1$ is possible from $J=0$. This means $J_{final} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the transition caused by the absorption of a single photon from the ground state is from $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$ to $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$. This is the lowest energy transition allowed by the standard selection rules for photon absorption. The options provided confirm this interpretation, as the purely rotational transition energy is far too small.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n$\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = E_{1,1} - E_{0,0}$\n\n*   $E_{1,1} = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(1)(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n*   $E_{0,0} = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(0)(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n$\\Delta E = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n\n**4. Calculate the Necessary Physical Constants**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the reduced mass ($\\mu$), the moment of inertia ($I$), and the rotational constant ($B$).\n\n*   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n    $M_x = 20$ amu, $M_y = 2$ amu. 1 amu = $1.6605 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n    $\\mu = \\frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{20 + 2} \\text{ amu} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu} = \\frac{20}{11} \\text{ amu}$\n    $\\mu = \\frac{20}{11} \\times (1.6605 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\approx 3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n    $R = 2$ angstroms = $2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n    $I = \\mu R^2 = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n    $I = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) \\text{ kg m}^2 = 1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2$\n\n*   **Rotational Constant ($B$):**\n    $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} = \\frac{(1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s})^2}{2 \\times (1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2)}$\n    $B = \\frac{1.112 \\times 10^{-68}}{2.4152 \\times 10^{-46}} \\text{ J} \\approx 4.604 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Transition Energy**\n\nNow we can calculate the two parts of the energy change, $\\hbar\\omega$ and $2B$.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term ($\\hbar\\omega$):**\n    $\\omega = 4 \\times 10^{14}$ rad/s\n    $\\hbar\\omega = (1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) = 4.218 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term ($2B$):**\n    $2B = 2 \\times (4.604 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) = 9.208 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n\n*   **Total Energy ($\\Delta E$):**\n    $\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega + 2B = (4.218 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}) + (9.208 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J})$\n    $\\Delta E = 4.218 \\times 10^{-20} + 0.009208 \\times 10^{-20} = 4.227 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Photon's Momentum ($p$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation $\\Delta E = pc$, where $c$ is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n\n$p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c} = \\frac{4.227 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}$\n$p \\approx 1.409 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N·s}$\n\nThis value is very close to option D.\n\n$p \\approx 1.4 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N·s}$\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first identify the initial and final energy states of the molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels and State Identification\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)*\n\nWhere:\n*   **v** is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **J** is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant.\n\nThe molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**, which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Initial State:** (v=0, J=0)\n\nThe \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" that can be reached by absorbing a photon is governed by spectroscopic selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from J=0, only a ΔJ = +1 transition is possible.\n*   **Selection Rules:** Δv = +1, ΔJ = +1\n*   **Final State:** (v=1, J=1)\n\n### 2. Calculation of Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω + B(0)(1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(2) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant B.\n\n**a. Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass of the X-Y molecule is calculated as:\nμ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y)\nμ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\nConverting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg):\nμ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia depends on the reduced mass and the bond length (R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\nI = μ * R²\nI ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI ≈ 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Rotational Constant (B):**\nThe rotational constant is given by:\nB = ħ² / (2I)\nB ≈ (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\nB ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n**d. Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, we can calculate the total energy change by summing the vibrational and rotational parts.\n*   Vibrational Energy Part: ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational Energy Part: ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 2 * (4.604 × 10⁻²³ J) = 9.208 × 10⁻²³ J\n*   Total Energy: ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0009208 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 3. Calculation of Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s). Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\np = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.406 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:** The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The total energy of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n    `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Transition:**\n    *   The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   The absorption of a photon causes a transition to a higher energy state. For rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   Therefore, the transition from the ground state (`v=0, J=0`) to the next state with the lowest possible energy *reachable by photon absorption* is to the state `v = 1`, `J = 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:** The energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the final and initial states.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(1/2)`\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(3/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I`\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I) - ħω(1/2) = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n4.  **Calculate Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):** `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`. We need to convert the masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg).\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):** `I = μ * R²`. We need to convert the bond length `R` from angstroms to meters.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum:** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) and the speed of light (`c`) by the equation `E_photon = p * c`. Therefore, the momentum is:\n    `p = E_photon / c = ΔE / c`\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations using the given values and physical constants.

The total energy of a state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    $E_{v,J} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = (v + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)$\n    where:\n    *   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n    *   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s)\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their minimum values:\n    *   $v_{initial} = 0$\n    *   $J_{initial} = 0$\n    So, the initial state is $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final State (The Most Careful Point):**\n    The molecule absorbs a photon to switch to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This implies a transition that is allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules for photon absorption. For a diatomic molecule with a permanent dipole moment (like X-Y, where X and Y are different elements), the selection rules for rovibrational transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta v = +1$ (for absorption)\n    *   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$\n\n    Starting from the initial state $J_i = 0$, a transition with $\\Delta J = -1$ is not possible (as J cannot be negative). Therefore, the only allowed rotational transition is $\\Delta J = +1$, which means $J_{final} = 1$.\n    Combining the selection rules, the lowest energy transition from the ground state is:\n    *   $v_{final} = v_{initial} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    *   $J_{final} = J_{initial} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    So, the final state is $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon ($\\Delta E$) must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   Initial Energy: $E_i = E_{0,0} = (0 + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 0(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Final Energy: $E_f = E_{1,1} = (1 + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 1(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    *   Energy Difference: $\\Delta E = E_f - E_i = (\\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}) - (\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega) = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n        *   $M_X = 20$ amu, $M_Y = 2$ amu.\n        *   $1 \\text{ amu} = 1.6605 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n        *   $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{20 + 2} = \\frac{40}{22} \\approx 1.818$ amu.\n        *   $\\mu = 1.818 \\text{ amu} \\times (1.6605 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg/amu}) \\approx 3.019 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n        *   $R = 2$ angstroms = $2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n        *   $I = \\mu R^2 = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n        *   $I = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) = 1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Change ($\\Delta E$):**\n    *   **Vibrational Part:** $\\hbar \\omega = (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) = 4.216 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.\n    *   **Rotational Part:** $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{I} = \\frac{(1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s})^2}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2} = \\frac{1.1109 \\times 10^{-68}}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46}} \\approx 9.20 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   **Total Energy Change:** $\\Delta E = (4.216 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}) + (9.20 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) \\approx 4.225 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.

Its energy levels are given by the formula:\n    E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n    where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency, and `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n\n*   **Final State and Selection Rules:** A photon is absorbed, causing a transition to a higher energy state. For a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for such a rovibrational transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, the change in the rotational quantum number must be ΔJ = +1. Therefore, the transition occurs from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1). This is the lowest possible energy transition that involves a change in the vibrational state.\n\n### 2.

Understand the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem specifies a diatomic molecule (X-Y) that can be described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\nThe energy for a specific rovibrational state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by the formula:\n\n**E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I).\n*   **I** is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identify the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so **v = 0** and **J = 0**.\n*   **Final State:** The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean the state with the absolute next-highest energy level, or it could refer to the most common type of transition studied in this context, which is a rovibrational transition.\n\nLet's analyze the possible transitions and their energies:\n*   **Pure Rotational Transition:** (v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1). The energy for this would be very low and typically falls in the microwave region of the spectrum.\n*   **Rovibrational Transition:** This involves a change in both `v` and `J`. For infrared absorption, the selection rules for a diatomic molecule are **Δv = +1** and **ΔJ = ±1**. Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state is to a state where **v = 1** and **J = 1**.\n\nBy examining the magnitude of the given options, it becomes clear that the question is referring to a rovibrational transition, as the calculated momentum for a pure rotational transition is several orders of magnitude smaller than any of the choices.\n\nSo, the transition is: **(v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **E_initial** = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final** = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy difference is:\n**ΔE** = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + 2B**\n\nSubstituting B = ħ² / (2I), we get:\n**ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4.

The selection rules for an absorption transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition that adheres to these rules is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot be negative).\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from **(v=0, J=0)** to **(v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):**\n    E(0,0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):**\n    E(1,1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nSince B = ħ² / (2I), we can write this as:\nΔE = ħω + ħ² / I\n\n### 4.

Defining the System and States\n\nThe molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the energy of a state is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Energy Levels:** E(v, J) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J)\n    *   Vibrational Energy: E_vib(v) = (v + 1/2)ħω\n    *   Rotational Energy: E_rot(J) = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n\nHere, `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Fundamental State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (or ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible quantum numbers: v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule, the transition must obey specific selection rules. For rovibrational transitions, these are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), we must find the allowed transition that leads to the state with the lowest possible energy. According to the selection rules:\n*   A pure rotational transition (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1) to the state (v=0, J=1) is possible.\n*   A rovibrational transition (Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1) to the state (v=1, J=1) is also possible.\n\nA transition to (v=1, J=0) would be forbidden because ΔJ=0 is not allowed for this type of molecule.\n\nLet's compare the energy of these two possible destination states:\n*   **E(v=0, J=1):** This corresponds to a pure rotational transition. The energy change is ΔE_rot = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = ħ²/I.\n*   **E(v=1, J=1):** This is a rovibrational transition. The energy change is ΔE_rovib = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = (ħω + ħ²/I).\n\nTypically, the vibrational energy change is much larger than the rotational energy change. Therefore, the transition to the (v=0, J=1) state is the one with the lowest energy change. However, calculating the momentum for this transition does not yield any of the provided options. This suggests that the question is likely asking for the lowest-energy *rovibrational* transition, which is a common focus in infrared spectroscopy.\n\nThe lowest-energy allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) is to the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\n### 3.

The molecule starts in its fundamental or ground state, which for the rotation-vibration model corresponds to a vibrational quantum number `v=0` and a rotational quantum number `J=0`. The energy of the absorbed photon must exactly match the energy difference between the initial and final states of the molecule.\n\nThe energy levels of a diatomic molecule in this model are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + Bħ²J(J+1)\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\nFor a photon to be absorbed, the transition must obey certain selection rules. For rovibrational transitions in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at `v=0` and `J=0` and absorbs energy, the final state must have `v'=1` and `J'=1`. A transition to `J'=-1` is not possible. Therefore, the specific transition is from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial energy levels:\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + Bħ²(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2Bħ²\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + 2Bħ²\n\nThis energy change consists of a vibrational part (ħω) and a rotational part (2Bħ²).

In the context of roto-vibrational spectroscopy and considering the selection rules (Δv = +1, ΔJ = ±1 for absorption), the lowest energy transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) involves moving to the next vibrational level (v=1). The lowest energy rotational change allowed is from J=0 to J=1. Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**: The energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by E(v,J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + [ħ²/(2I)]*J(J+1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ω is the vibrational angular frequency, and I is the moment of inertia.\n    *   Initial energy: E_initial = E(0,0) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   Final energy: E_final = E(1,1) = (3/2)ħω + [ħ²/(2I)]*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n    *   The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference: ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + ħ²/I.\n\n3.  **Calculate Necessary Parameters**:\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ)**: For a diatomic molecule with masses Mx and My, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

The initial state is the ground state `(v=0, J=0)`. The \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is interpreted as the lowest energy rovibrational transition, `(v=1, J=1)`, as this utilizes the provided vibrational frequency `ω` and adheres to the quantum selection rules `Δv=+1` and `ΔJ=+1`.\n2.  **Energy Calculation:** The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy difference `ΔE` between these states:\n    $ΔE = (\\text{Energy of } v=1, J=1) - (\\text{Energy of } v=0, J=0)$\n    $ΔE = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    where `I` is the moment of inertia, $I = \\mu R^2$.\n3.  **Momentum Calculation:** The photon's momentum is given by $p = \\frac{ΔE}{c}$.\n4.  **Numerical Result:** The Python script accurately calculates the reduced mass `μ`, the moment of inertia `I`, the total energy change `ΔE`, and finally the momentum `p`.

The energy levels of such a molecule are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    $E_{v,J} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = \\hbar \\omega (v + 1/2) + B J(J+1)$\n    *   $v=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the vibrational quantum number.\n    *   $J=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the rotational quantum number.\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$).\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant, where $I$ is the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are zero: $v=0, J=0$.\n        $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Final State:** The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" From the ground state, there are two primary types of excitations:\n        *   **Rotational Excitation:** The molecule absorbs a small amount of energy and moves to the next rotational level while staying in the same vibrational state. The selection rule for absorption is $\\Delta J = +1$. So, the transition is from $(v=0, J=0)$ to $(v=0, J=1)$.\n        *   **Vibrational Excitation:** The molecule absorbs a larger amount of energy and moves to the next vibrational level. The selection rule is $\\Delta v = +1$. The lowest energy transition of this type would be from $(v=0, J=0)$ to $(v=1, J=1)$ (since $\\Delta J$ must also be $\\pm 1$).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of Each Transition:**\n    *   **Energy for Rotational Transition ($\\Delta E_{rot}$):**\n        This transition is from $(v=0, J=0)$ to $(v=0, J=1)$.\n        $\\Delta E_{rot} = E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = [\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega + B\\cdot1(1+1)] - [\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega] = 2B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$.\n        To calculate this, we need the moment of inertia, $I = \\mu R^2$.\n        *   Reduced mass ($\\mu$): $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu}$.\n        *   Using the python script from the thinking process, the calculated energy was $\\Delta E_{rot} \\approx 9.21 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$.\n\n    *   **Energy for Vibrational Transition ($\\Delta E_{vib}$):**\n        The energy jump is primarily determined by the change in the vibrational quantum number, $\\Delta v=1$. The energy for this is $\\Delta E_{vib} = \\hbar \\omega$.\n        $\\Delta E_{vib} = (1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) \\approx 4.22 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Lowest Energy Transition:**\n    Comparing the two energy gaps:\n    *   $\\Delta E_{rot} \\approx 9.21 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n    *   $\\Delta E_{vib} \\approx 4.22 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n    Clearly, $\\Delta E_{rot} \\ll \\Delta E_{vib}$. The rotational energy gap is about 450 times smaller than the vibrational energy gap. Therefore, the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is the pure rotational transition.\n\n5.  **Calculate Photon Momentum and Compare with Options:**\n    The momentum ($p$) of a photon is related to its energy ($E$) by the equation $E=pc$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Thus, $p = E/c$.\n    *   **Momentum for the lowest energy (rotational) transition:**\n        $p_{rot} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{rot}}{c} = \\frac{9.21 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 3.07 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n        This value matches the code output but does not match any of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D). The options are several orders of magnitude larger.\n\n6.  **Re-evaluate the Question's Intent:**\n    The discrepancy between the calculated momentum for the true lowest-energy transition and the given options suggests that the question is not asking for the literal lowest energy jump. Instead, it is likely asking for the momentum corresponding to the fundamental **vibrational transition** ($v=0 \\to v=1$), which is a very common type of excitation studied in infrared spectroscopy. Let's calculate the photon momentum for this transition.\n    *   **Momentum for the vibrational transition:**\n        $p_{vib} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{vib}}{c} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{c}$\n        $p_{vib} = \\frac{4.22 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 1.407 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated momentum of $1.407 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{s}$ for the vibrational transition is an excellent match for option B. Therefore, despite the phrasing \"next state with the lowest possible energy,\" the context and the provided answers indicate that the question is about the vibrational excitation of the molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe reasoning and calculation steps are as follows:\n\n### 1.

Understanding the Molecular State and Transitions**\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is determined by its vibrational quantum number (v) and rotational quantum number (J). The total energy E(v, J) is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies.\n\n*   **Ground State:** The lowest energy state, or ground state, corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, which are v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule and induce a ro-vibrational transition, specific selection rules must be followed. For the fundamental transition, the change in quantum numbers must be Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   **Transition from Ground State:** Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only allowed transition according to these rules is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot become negative). Therefore, the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" accessible via photon absorption is the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\n**2.

Understand the Energy Levels of the System**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (also known as the non-rigid rotor). The total energy of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + B·J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n*   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I)\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia, defined as I = μR²\n*   `μ` is the reduced mass of the molecule\n\n**2. Identify the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State (Ground State):** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both `v` and `J` are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and switches to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". In quantum mechanics, a transition via photon absorption must obey selection rules. For a diatomic molecule with a permanent dipole moment (like XY, where X ≠ Y), the selection rules for rotation-vibration transitions are:\n    *   Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n    *   ΔJ = ±1\n\n    Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), we apply these rules:\n    *   The new vibrational state must be `v = 1`.\n    *   The new rotational state must change by `ΔJ = ±1`. Since `J` cannot be negative, only `ΔJ = +1` is allowed. The new rotational state must be `J = 1`.\n\n    Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)\n\nΔE = [(1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1)] - [(0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1)]\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n**4.

Calculate the Photon's Momentum\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum (p) and the speed of light (c = 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) by the equation E = pc. Therefore, p = E/c.\n\np = (4.2189 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s (or N·s)\n\nThis value is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** The problem involves a diatomic molecule in its fundamental quantum state (`vibrational quantum number v=0`, `rotational quantum number J=0`). It absorbs a photon and transitions to a higher energy state. The energy of the absorbed photon, `ΔE`, determines its momentum, `p`, via the relation `p = ΔE / c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n2.  **Identify Possible Transitions:** From the fundamental state (`v=0, J=0`), a single-photon absorption allows transitions where `ΔJ = +1`. The two lowest-energy possibilities are:\n    *   **Pure Rotational Transition:** `(v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1)`. The energy required is `ΔE_rot = 2B`, where `B` is the rotational constant.\n    *   **Rovibrational Transition:** `(v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1)`. The energy required is `ΔE_rovib = ħw + 2B`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `w` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n3.  **Interpret the Question:** The phrase \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" literally refers to the pure rotational transition, as `ΔE_rot` is much smaller than `ΔE_rovib`. However, we will calculate the momentum for both cases and compare them with the given options. This will help determine the intended transition.\n4.  **Perform Calculations:**\n    *   Convert all given units (amu to kg, angstroms to meters) to the SI system.\n    *   Calculate the reduced mass (`μ`) of the molecule.\n    *   Calculate the moment of inertia (`I = μR²`).\n    *   Calculate the rotational constant (`B = ħ² / (2I)`).\n    *   Calculate the energy change `ΔE` for the rovibrational transition (`ΔE = ħw + 2B`).\n    *   Calculate the corresponding photon momentum (`p = ΔE / c`).\n5.  **Select the Answer:** Compare the calculated momentum with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct choice.

The total energy `E` of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational energy and rotational energy. The energy levels are quantized and described by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy formula for a state `(v, J)` is:\n`E(v, J) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J+1)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.054 x 10^-34 J·s`).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Initial and Final States\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state\". This is the state with the absolute lowest energy, which corresponds to the ground vibrational and rotational levels: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". To find this state, we must consider the possible transitions from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)`. For a photon to be absorbed, its energy must exactly match the energy difference `ΔE` between the initial and final states.\n    There are two main types of transitions to consider:\n    1.  **Pure Rotational Transition:** The vibrational state does not change (`Δv=0`), but the rotational state does (`ΔJ=+1`). The final state would be `(v=0, J=1)`.\n    2.  **Ro-Vibrational Transition:** Both vibrational and rotational states change. The selection rules for photon absorption are `Δv=+1` and `ΔJ=±1`. Starting from `J=0`, the only possibility is `ΔJ=+1`. The final state would be `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Change (ΔE) for Each Possible Transition\n\nTo determine which transition corresponds to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\", we need to compare the energy of the two potential final states.\n\n*   **Case 1: Pure Rotational Transition `(v=0, J=0) -> (v=0, J=1)`**\n    `E_final = E(0, 1) = (1/2)ħω + B*1(1+1) = (1/2)ħω + 2B`\n    `ΔE_rot = E(0, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(1/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = 2B`\n\n*   **Case 2: Ro-Vibrational Transition `(v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1)`**\n    `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n    `ΔE_rovib = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B`\n\nTypically, the rotational energy spacing (`2B`) is much smaller than the vibrational energy spacing (`ħω`). This means the pure rotational transition requires significantly less energy. Therefore, the true \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is `(v=0, J=1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Necessary Values and Photon Momentum\n\nLet's calculate the numerical values to confirm our assumption and find the photon momentum `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n**Constants and Given Values:**\n*   `Mx = 20 amu`, `My = 2 amu`. (1 amu ≈ 1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg)\n*   `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n*   `ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s`\n*   `ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n*   `c = 3 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Reduced Mass (`μ`):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 amu = (20/11) amu`\n    `μ ≈ (1.818) * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n2.  **Moment of Inertia (`I`):**\n    `I = μR² = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n    `I = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) = 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n3.  **Rotational Energy Term (`2B`):**\n    `2B = 2 * (ħ² / 2I) = ħ² / I`\n    `2B = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.2 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n4.  **Vibrational Energy Term (`ħω`):**\n    `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n**Momentum Calculation for Both Cases:**\n*   **Photon for Rotational Transition:** `p_rot = ΔE_rot / c = (2B) / c ≈ (9.2 x 10⁻²³ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 3.1 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`\n*   **Photon for Ro-Vibrational Transition:** `p_rovib = ΔE_rovib / c = (ħω + 2B) / c ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\n### Step 5: Final Analysis and Answer Selection\n\nComparing our calculated momenta with the given options:\nA) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nB) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nD) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated momentum for the pure rotational transition (`~3.1 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`) does not match any option. However, the momentum for the ro-vibrational transition (`~1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`) is a perfect match for option A.\n\n**Conclusion:** Although the wording \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" strictly implies the pure rotational transition, the numerical options provided force us to conclude that the question is asking for the momentum required for the lowest-energy *ro-vibrational* transition from the ground state (`v=0, J=0` to `v=1, J=1`). The energy for this transition is `ΔE = ħω + 2B`, which is dominated by the `ħω` term.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n`p = ΔE / c ≈ ħω / c`\n`p = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) = 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to find the energy of the transition. The molecule is initially in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) quantum numbers.\n\nThe energy levels of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by:\nEᵥ,ⱼ = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)] * J(J+1)\n\nWhere:\n*   v is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   J is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration (4 * 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\nThe problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" While the absolute lowest energy transition from the ground state would be a purely rotational one (from J=0 to J=1), the inclusion of the vibrational frequency (ω) in the problem data, combined with the provided options, strongly suggests that a rovibrational transition is intended.\n\nThe selection rules for an allowed rovibrational transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next lowest rovibrational state that can be reached is (v=1, J=1).\n\nThe energy of the transition (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial states:\n*   Initial state energy (v=0, J=0): E_initial = ħω(0 + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)]*0*(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   Final state energy (v=1, J=1): E_final = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)]*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is therefore:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = ( (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ) - ( (1/2)ħω ) = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThis energy is related to the photon's momentum (p) by the equation ΔE = pc, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s).

While the rotationally excited state `(v=0, J=1)` is lower in energy, the problem gives a vibrational frequency and the answer choices are of a magnitude that suggests a more energetic transition. Standard selection rules for photon absorption by a diatomic molecule are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`. Starting from `J=0`, the only possibility for `ΔJ` is `+1`.

Model and Energy Levels\nThe molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a particular state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J+1)\n\nwhere:\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   B is the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / 2I`\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\nThe fundamental (ground) state is where `v=0` and `J=0`.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\nFor a photon to be absorbed and induce a transition, spectroscopic selection rules must be followed. For rovibrational transitions in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n\nStarting from the ground state (`v=0`, `J=0`), the molecule must transition to the next vibrational level (`v=1`). The selection rule `ΔJ = ±1` means the rotational quantum number `J` must change to `J=1` (as `J=-1` is not possible).\n\nTherefore, the transition is from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)` to the final state `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\nThe energy of the initial state is:\nE_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\nThe energy of the final state is:\nE_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these two levels:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = ħω + 2B\n\nThis energy can be approximated as just `ħω` because the rotational energy (`2B`) is typically much smaller than the vibrational energy (`ħω`).\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\nFirst, we calculate the energy jump due to vibration `ħω`:\n*   ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   **ΔE ≈ ħω** = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ s⁻¹) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 5. Calculating Photon Momentum (p)\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the equation `p = E/c`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\n*   p ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n(Note: A more precise calculation would include the rotational energy term `2B = ħ²/I`. First, the reduced mass `μ` is calculated as `(Mx*My)/(Mx+My)` = 1.818 amu or 3.02 x 10⁻²⁷ kg. The moment of inertia `I = μR²` is then `(3.02 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`. This gives a rotational energy correction that is very small compared to the vibrational energy and does not change the result to two significant figures.)\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to identify the initial and final energy states of the molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n**1. Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state for both vibration and rotation. This corresponds to a vibrational quantum number `v = 0` and a rotational quantum number `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" requires exciting the molecule. There are two possibilities: a pure rotational transition or a rovibrational transition.\n    *   A pure rotational transition (v=0 → v=0, J=0 → J=1) has a very low energy, typically in the microwave region of the spectrum.\n    *   A rovibrational transition involves changing both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. Given the magnitude of the options, the question is referring to a transition to the next vibrational level, which requires significantly more energy and corresponds to infrared absorption.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed, the transition must obey certain selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a diatomic molecule, the rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition to the next vibrational level (v=1) is to the rotational state J=1 (since J cannot decrease). Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n**2. Energy Calculation**\n\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J(J+1)\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number.\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number.\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\n\nΔE = E(final) - E(initial)\nΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)\nΔE = [(1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1)] - [(0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1)]\nΔE = [3/2 ħω + 2B] - [1/2 ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia (I).\n\n**3.

The photon's momentum (p) is then found using the relation p = ΔE / c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels of the Rovibrational Model\n\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For rovibrational spectroscopy of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules for an allowed transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Since the initial vibrational state is `v = 0`, the next vibrational state must be `v = 1`.\n    *   Since the initial rotational state is `J = 0`, the only possible change is ΔJ = +1, leading to a final rotational state of `J = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nFirst, we find the energy of the initial and final states:\n*   **E_initial** = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final** = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these states:\n*   **ΔE** = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I) ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\n**a. Calculate the Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass for a diatomic molecule with atomic masses Mx and My is:\n*   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n*   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n*   Converting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia is I = μR², where R is the bond length.\n*   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n*   I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Model and Energy Levels**\n\nThe problem uses the **quantum rotation-vibration model** for a diatomic molecule. The energy of a state is quantized and depends on two quantum numbers:\n*   `v`, the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J`, the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe total energy `E` of a state `(v, J)` is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n$E_{v,J} = (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B J(J+1)$\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `B` is the rotational constant, related to the molecule's moment of inertia `I` by $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$.\n\n### **2. Identify the Initial and Final States (The Most Careful Point)**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its **fundamental state**. This is the state with the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: `(v=0, J=0)`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" A transition caused by photon absorption must follow quantum mechanical **selection rules**. For a rovibrational transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the rules are:\n    *   $\\Delta v = +1$ (for absorption).\n    *   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$.\n\n    Starting from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)`:\n    *   `v` must change by +1, so the final state must have `v = 1`.\n    *   `J` must change by ±1. Since `J` cannot be negative, the only possibility is `ΔJ = +1`, so the final state must have `J = 1`.\n\n    Therefore, the lowest energy transition from the ground state that is allowed by these selection rules is to the state **(v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon, `ΔE`, must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   Initial Energy: $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(0)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   Final Energy: $E_{final} = E_{1,1} = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(1)(2) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n\nThe energy difference is:\n$\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$\nSince $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$, this is equivalent to: $\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Photon's Momentum**\n\nThe momentum `p` of a photon is related to its energy `E` by the equation `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the momentum is:\n$p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega + \\hbar^2/I}{c}$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can perform the calculations with a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\nh_bar = 1.0545718e-34\n# Speed of light (m/s)\nc = 2.99792458e8\n# Atomic mass unit to kg conversion\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27\n\n# --- Given Parameters ---\n# Mass of atom X (amu)\nMx_amu = 20\n# Mass of atom Y (amu)\nMy_amu = 2\n# Molecular bond length (m)\nR_m = 2 * 1e-10\n# Angular frequency of vibration (rad/s)\nomega = 4.0e14\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Convert masses to kg\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\n\n# Calculate reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# Calculate the energy of the rovibrational transition\n# Delta E = h_bar*omega + h_bar**2 / I\ndelta_E = h_bar * omega + h_bar**2 / I\n\n# Calculate the photon's momentum (p)\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The calculated momentum is: {p:.3e} N*s\")\n```\n\nThe script execution returns the following result:\n`The calculated momentum is: 1.410e-28 N*s`\n\n### **5.

This corresponds to the quantum numbers $(v, J) = (0, 0)$.\n\nThe molecule then **absorbs a photon** and transitions to a higher energy state. The question asks for the momentum of this photon for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\".\n\n**2. Interpreting the Transition**\n\nThe phrase \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" can be ambiguous.\n*   A literal interpretation would mean the state with energy just above the ground state, which is the first rotational state $(v, J) = (0, 1)$. The energy for this transition would be $\\Delta E = E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = 2B$.\n*   However, the process is specified as **photon absorption**. This physical process is governed by selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule (like XY), the infrared absorption selection rules are $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$.\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $(v, J) = (0, 0)$:\n*   $\\Delta v = +1 \\implies v_{final} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$. Since $J$ cannot be negative, only $\\Delta J = +1$ is possible from $J=0$. This means $J_{final} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the transition caused by the absorption of a single photon from the ground state is from $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$ to $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$. This is the lowest energy transition allowed by the standard selection rules for photon absorption. The options provided confirm this interpretation, as the purely rotational transition energy is far too small.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n$\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = E_{1,1} - E_{0,0}$\n\n*   $E_{1,1} = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(1)(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n*   $E_{0,0} = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(0)(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n$\\Delta E = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n\n**4.

Calculate the Total Transition Energy**\n\nNow we can calculate the two parts of the energy change, $\\hbar\\omega$ and $2B$.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term ($\\hbar\\omega$):**\n    $\\omega = 4 \\times 10^{14}$ rad/s\n    $\\hbar\\omega = (1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) = 4.218 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term ($2B$):**\n    $2B = 2 \\times (4.604 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) = 9.208 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n\n*   **Total Energy ($\\Delta E$):**\n    $\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega + 2B = (4.218 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}) + (9.208 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J})$\n    $\\Delta E = 4.218 \\times 10^{-20} + 0.009208 \\times 10^{-20} = 4.227 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Photon's Momentum ($p$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation $\\Delta E = pc$, where $c$ is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n\n$p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c} = \\frac{4.227 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}$\n$p \\approx 1.409 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N·s}$\n\nThis value is very close to option D.\n\n$p \\approx 1.4 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N·s}$\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first identify the initial and final energy states of the molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels and State Identification\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)*\n\nWhere:\n*   **v** is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **J** is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant.\n\nThe molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**, which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Initial State:** (v=0, J=0)\n\nThe \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" that can be reached by absorbing a photon is governed by spectroscopic selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from J=0, only a ΔJ = +1 transition is possible.\n*   **Selection Rules:** Δv = +1, ΔJ = +1\n*   **Final State:** (v=1, J=1)\n\n### 2. Calculation of Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω + B(0)(1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(2) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant B.\n\n**a. Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass of the X-Y molecule is calculated as:\nμ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y)\nμ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\nConverting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg):\nμ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia depends on the reduced mass and the bond length (R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\nI = μ * R²\nI ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI ≈ 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Rotational Constant (B):**\nThe rotational constant is given by:\nB = ħ² / (2I)\nB ≈ (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\nB ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n**d. Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, we can calculate the total energy change by summing the vibrational and rotational parts.\n*   Vibrational Energy Part: ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational Energy Part: ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 2 * (4.604 × 10⁻²³ J) = 9.208 × 10⁻²³ J\n*   Total Energy: ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0009208 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 3. Calculation of Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s). Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\np = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.406 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:** The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The total energy of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n    `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Transition:**\n    *   The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   The absorption of a photon causes a transition to a higher energy state. For rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   Therefore, the transition from the ground state (`v=0, J=0`) to the next state with the lowest possible energy *reachable by photon absorption* is to the state `v = 1`, `J = 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:** The energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the final and initial states.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(1/2)`\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(3/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I`\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I) - ħω(1/2) = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n4.  **Calculate Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):** `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`. We need to convert the masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg).\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):** `I = μ * R²`. We need to convert the bond length `R` from angstroms to meters.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum:** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) and the speed of light (`c`) by the equation `E_photon = p * c`. Therefore, the momentum is:\n    `p = E_photon / c = ΔE / c`\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations using the given values and physical constants.

The total energy of a state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    $E_{v,J} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = (v + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)$\n    where:\n    *   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n    *   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s)\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their minimum values:\n    *   $v_{initial} = 0$\n    *   $J_{initial} = 0$\n    So, the initial state is $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final State (The Most Careful Point):**\n    The molecule absorbs a photon to switch to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This implies a transition that is allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules for photon absorption. For a diatomic molecule with a permanent dipole moment (like X-Y, where X and Y are different elements), the selection rules for rovibrational transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta v = +1$ (for absorption)\n    *   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$\n\n    Starting from the initial state $J_i = 0$, a transition with $\\Delta J = -1$ is not possible (as J cannot be negative). Therefore, the only allowed rotational transition is $\\Delta J = +1$, which means $J_{final} = 1$.\n    Combining the selection rules, the lowest energy transition from the ground state is:\n    *   $v_{final} = v_{initial} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    *   $J_{final} = J_{initial} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    So, the final state is $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon ($\\Delta E$) must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   Initial Energy: $E_i = E_{0,0} = (0 + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 0(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Final Energy: $E_f = E_{1,1} = (1 + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 1(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    *   Energy Difference: $\\Delta E = E_f - E_i = (\\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}) - (\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega) = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n        *   $M_X = 20$ amu, $M_Y = 2$ amu.\n        *   $1 \\text{ amu} = 1.6605 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n        *   $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{20 + 2} = \\frac{40}{22} \\approx 1.818$ amu.\n        *   $\\mu = 1.818 \\text{ amu} \\times (1.6605 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg/amu}) \\approx 3.019 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n        *   $R = 2$ angstroms = $2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n        *   $I = \\mu R^2 = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n        *   $I = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) = 1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Change ($\\Delta E$):**\n    *   **Vibrational Part:** $\\hbar \\omega = (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) = 4.216 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.\n    *   **Rotational Part:** $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{I} = \\frac{(1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s})^2}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2} = \\frac{1.1109 \\times 10^{-68}}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46}} \\approx 9.20 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   **Total Energy Change:** $\\Delta E = (4.216 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}) + (9.20 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) \\approx 4.225 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.

Its energy levels are given by the formula:\n    E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n    where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency, and `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n\n*   **Final State and Selection Rules:** A photon is absorbed, causing a transition to a higher energy state. For a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for such a rovibrational transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, the change in the rotational quantum number must be ΔJ = +1. Therefore, the transition occurs from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1). This is the lowest possible energy transition that involves a change in the vibrational state.\n\n### 2.

Understand the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem specifies a diatomic molecule (X-Y) that can be described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\nThe energy for a specific rovibrational state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by the formula:\n\n**E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I).\n*   **I** is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identify the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so **v = 0** and **J = 0**.\n*   **Final State:** The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean the state with the absolute next-highest energy level, or it could refer to the most common type of transition studied in this context, which is a rovibrational transition.\n\nLet's analyze the possible transitions and their energies:\n*   **Pure Rotational Transition:** (v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1). The energy for this would be very low and typically falls in the microwave region of the spectrum.\n*   **Rovibrational Transition:** This involves a change in both `v` and `J`. For infrared absorption, the selection rules for a diatomic molecule are **Δv = +1** and **ΔJ = ±1**. Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state is to a state where **v = 1** and **J = 1**.\n\nBy examining the magnitude of the given options, it becomes clear that the question is referring to a rovibrational transition, as the calculated momentum for a pure rotational transition is several orders of magnitude smaller than any of the choices.\n\nSo, the transition is: **(v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **E_initial** = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final** = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy difference is:\n**ΔE** = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + 2B**\n\nSubstituting B = ħ² / (2I), we get:\n**ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4.

The selection rules for an absorption transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition that adheres to these rules is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot be negative).\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from **(v=0, J=0)** to **(v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):**\n    E(0,0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):**\n    E(1,1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nSince B = ħ² / (2I), we can write this as:\nΔE = ħω + ħ² / I\n\n### 4.

Defining the System and States\n\nThe molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the energy of a state is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Energy Levels:** E(v, J) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J)\n    *   Vibrational Energy: E_vib(v) = (v + 1/2)ħω\n    *   Rotational Energy: E_rot(J) = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n\nHere, `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Fundamental State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (or ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible quantum numbers: v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule, the transition must obey specific selection rules. For rovibrational transitions, these are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), we must find the allowed transition that leads to the state with the lowest possible energy. According to the selection rules:\n*   A pure rotational transition (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1) to the state (v=0, J=1) is possible.\n*   A rovibrational transition (Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1) to the state (v=1, J=1) is also possible.\n\nA transition to (v=1, J=0) would be forbidden because ΔJ=0 is not allowed for this type of molecule.\n\nLet's compare the energy of these two possible destination states:\n*   **E(v=0, J=1):** This corresponds to a pure rotational transition. The energy change is ΔE_rot = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = ħ²/I.\n*   **E(v=1, J=1):** This is a rovibrational transition. The energy change is ΔE_rovib = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = (ħω + ħ²/I).\n\nTypically, the vibrational energy change is much larger than the rotational energy change. Therefore, the transition to the (v=0, J=1) state is the one with the lowest energy change. However, calculating the momentum for this transition does not yield any of the provided options. This suggests that the question is likely asking for the lowest-energy *rovibrational* transition, which is a common focus in infrared spectroscopy.\n\nThe lowest-energy allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) is to the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\n### 3.

The molecule starts in its fundamental or ground state, which for the rotation-vibration model corresponds to a vibrational quantum number `v=0` and a rotational quantum number `J=0`. The energy of the absorbed photon must exactly match the energy difference between the initial and final states of the molecule.\n\nThe energy levels of a diatomic molecule in this model are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + Bħ²J(J+1)\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\nFor a photon to be absorbed, the transition must obey certain selection rules. For rovibrational transitions in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at `v=0` and `J=0` and absorbs energy, the final state must have `v'=1` and `J'=1`. A transition to `J'=-1` is not possible. Therefore, the specific transition is from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial energy levels:\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + Bħ²(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2Bħ²\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + 2Bħ²\n\nThis energy change consists of a vibrational part (ħω) and a rotational part (2Bħ²).

In the context of roto-vibrational spectroscopy and considering the selection rules (Δv = +1, ΔJ = ±1 for absorption), the lowest energy transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) involves moving to the next vibrational level (v=1). The lowest energy rotational change allowed is from J=0 to J=1. Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**: The energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by E(v,J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + [ħ²/(2I)]*J(J+1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ω is the vibrational angular frequency, and I is the moment of inertia.\n    *   Initial energy: E_initial = E(0,0) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   Final energy: E_final = E(1,1) = (3/2)ħω + [ħ²/(2I)]*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n    *   The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference: ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + ħ²/I.\n\n3.  **Calculate Necessary Parameters**:\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ)**: For a diatomic molecule with masses Mx and My, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

The initial state is the ground state `(v=0, J=0)`. The \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is interpreted as the lowest energy rovibrational transition, `(v=1, J=1)`, as this utilizes the provided vibrational frequency `ω` and adheres to the quantum selection rules `Δv=+1` and `ΔJ=+1`.\n2.  **Energy Calculation:** The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy difference `ΔE` between these states:\n    $ΔE = (\\text{Energy of } v=1, J=1) - (\\text{Energy of } v=0, J=0)$\n    $ΔE = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    where `I` is the moment of inertia, $I = \\mu R^2$.\n3.  **Momentum Calculation:** The photon's momentum is given by $p = \\frac{ΔE}{c}$.\n4.  **Numerical Result:** The Python script accurately calculates the reduced mass `μ`, the moment of inertia `I`, the total energy change `ΔE`, and finally the momentum `p`.

The energy levels of such a molecule are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    $E_{v,J} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = \\hbar \\omega (v + 1/2) + B J(J+1)$\n    *   $v=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the vibrational quantum number.\n    *   $J=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the rotational quantum number.\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$).\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant, where $I$ is the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are zero: $v=0, J=0$.\n        $E_{initial} = E_{0,0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Final State:** The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" From the ground state, there are two primary types of excitations:\n        *   **Rotational Excitation:** The molecule absorbs a small amount of energy and moves to the next rotational level while staying in the same vibrational state. The selection rule for absorption is $\\Delta J = +1$. So, the transition is from $(v=0, J=0)$ to $(v=0, J=1)$.\n        *   **Vibrational Excitation:** The molecule absorbs a larger amount of energy and moves to the next vibrational level. The selection rule is $\\Delta v = +1$. The lowest energy transition of this type would be from $(v=0, J=0)$ to $(v=1, J=1)$ (since $\\Delta J$ must also be $\\pm 1$).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of Each Transition:**\n    *   **Energy for Rotational Transition ($\\Delta E_{rot}$):**\n        This transition is from $(v=0, J=0)$ to $(v=0, J=1)$.\n        $\\Delta E_{rot} = E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = [\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega + B\\cdot1(1+1)] - [\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega] = 2B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$.\n        To calculate this, we need the moment of inertia, $I = \\mu R^2$.\n        *   Reduced mass ($\\mu$): $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu}$.\n        *   Using the python script from the thinking process, the calculated energy was $\\Delta E_{rot} \\approx 9.21 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$.\n\n    *   **Energy for Vibrational Transition ($\\Delta E_{vib}$):**\n        The energy jump is primarily determined by the change in the vibrational quantum number, $\\Delta v=1$. The energy for this is $\\Delta E_{vib} = \\hbar \\omega$.\n        $\\Delta E_{vib} = (1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) \\approx 4.22 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Lowest Energy Transition:**\n    Comparing the two energy gaps:\n    *   $\\Delta E_{rot} \\approx 9.21 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n    *   $\\Delta E_{vib} \\approx 4.22 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n    Clearly, $\\Delta E_{rot} \\ll \\Delta E_{vib}$. The rotational energy gap is about 450 times smaller than the vibrational energy gap. Therefore, the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is the pure rotational transition.\n\n5.  **Calculate Photon Momentum and Compare with Options:**\n    The momentum ($p$) of a photon is related to its energy ($E$) by the equation $E=pc$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Thus, $p = E/c$.\n    *   **Momentum for the lowest energy (rotational) transition:**\n        $p_{rot} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{rot}}{c} = \\frac{9.21 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 3.07 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n        This value matches the code output but does not match any of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D). The options are several orders of magnitude larger.\n\n6.  **Re-evaluate the Question's Intent:**\n    The discrepancy between the calculated momentum for the true lowest-energy transition and the given options suggests that the question is not asking for the literal lowest energy jump. Instead, it is likely asking for the momentum corresponding to the fundamental **vibrational transition** ($v=0 \\to v=1$), which is a very common type of excitation studied in infrared spectroscopy. Let's calculate the photon momentum for this transition.\n    *   **Momentum for the vibrational transition:**\n        $p_{vib} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{vib}}{c} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{c}$\n        $p_{vib} = \\frac{4.22 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 1.407 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated momentum of $1.407 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{s}$ for the vibrational transition is an excellent match for option B. Therefore, despite the phrasing \"next state with the lowest possible energy,\" the context and the provided answers indicate that the question is about the vibrational excitation of the molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe reasoning and calculation steps are as follows:\n\n### 1.

Understanding the Molecular State and Transitions**\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is determined by its vibrational quantum number (v) and rotational quantum number (J). The total energy E(v, J) is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies.\n\n*   **Ground State:** The lowest energy state, or ground state, corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, which are v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule and induce a ro-vibrational transition, specific selection rules must be followed. For the fundamental transition, the change in quantum numbers must be Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   **Transition from Ground State:** Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only allowed transition according to these rules is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot become negative). Therefore, the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" accessible via photon absorption is the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\n**2.

Understand the Energy Levels of the System**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (also known as the non-rigid rotor). The total energy of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħω + B·J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n*   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I)\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia, defined as I = μR²\n*   `μ` is the reduced mass of the molecule\n\n**2. Identify the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State (Ground State):** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both `v` and `J` are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and switches to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". In quantum mechanics, a transition via photon absorption must obey selection rules. For a diatomic molecule with a permanent dipole moment (like XY, where X ≠ Y), the selection rules for rotation-vibration transitions are:\n    *   Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n    *   ΔJ = ±1\n\n    Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), we apply these rules:\n    *   The new vibrational state must be `v = 1`.\n    *   The new rotational state must change by `ΔJ = ±1`. Since `J` cannot be negative, only `ΔJ = +1` is allowed. The new rotational state must be `J = 1`.\n\n    Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)\n\nΔE = [(1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1)] - [(0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1)]\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n**4.

Calculate the Photon's Momentum\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum (p) and the speed of light (c = 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) by the equation E = pc. Therefore, p = E/c.\n\np = (4.2189 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s (or N·s)\n\nThis value is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** The problem involves a diatomic molecule in its fundamental quantum state (`vibrational quantum number v=0`, `rotational quantum number J=0`). It absorbs a photon and transitions to a higher energy state. The energy of the absorbed photon, `ΔE`, determines its momentum, `p`, via the relation `p = ΔE / c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n2.  **Identify Possible Transitions:** From the fundamental state (`v=0, J=0`), a single-photon absorption allows transitions where `ΔJ = +1`. The two lowest-energy possibilities are:\n    *   **Pure Rotational Transition:** `(v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1)`. The energy required is `ΔE_rot = 2B`, where `B` is the rotational constant.\n    *   **Rovibrational Transition:** `(v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1)`. The energy required is `ΔE_rovib = ħw + 2B`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `w` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n3.  **Interpret the Question:** The phrase \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" literally refers to the pure rotational transition, as `ΔE_rot` is much smaller than `ΔE_rovib`. However, we will calculate the momentum for both cases and compare them with the given options. This will help determine the intended transition.\n4.  **Perform Calculations:**\n    *   Convert all given units (amu to kg, angstroms to meters) to the SI system.\n    *   Calculate the reduced mass (`μ`) of the molecule.\n    *   Calculate the moment of inertia (`I = μR²`).\n    *   Calculate the rotational constant (`B = ħ² / (2I)`).\n    *   Calculate the energy change `ΔE` for the rovibrational transition (`ΔE = ħw + 2B`).\n    *   Calculate the corresponding photon momentum (`p = ΔE / c`).\n5.  **Select the Answer:** Compare the calculated momentum with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct choice.

The total energy `E` of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational energy and rotational energy. The energy levels are quantized and described by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy formula for a state `(v, J)` is:\n`E(v, J) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J+1)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.054 x 10^-34 J·s`).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Initial and Final States\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state\". This is the state with the absolute lowest energy, which corresponds to the ground vibrational and rotational levels: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". To find this state, we must consider the possible transitions from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)`. For a photon to be absorbed, its energy must exactly match the energy difference `ΔE` between the initial and final states.\n    There are two main types of transitions to consider:\n    1.  **Pure Rotational Transition:** The vibrational state does not change (`Δv=0`), but the rotational state does (`ΔJ=+1`). The final state would be `(v=0, J=1)`.\n    2.  **Ro-Vibrational Transition:** Both vibrational and rotational states change. The selection rules for photon absorption are `Δv=+1` and `ΔJ=±1`. Starting from `J=0`, the only possibility is `ΔJ=+1`. The final state would be `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Change (ΔE) for Each Possible Transition\n\nTo determine which transition corresponds to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\", we need to compare the energy of the two potential final states.\n\n*   **Case 1: Pure Rotational Transition `(v=0, J=0) -> (v=0, J=1)`**\n    `E_final = E(0, 1) = (1/2)ħω + B*1(1+1) = (1/2)ħω + 2B`\n    `ΔE_rot = E(0, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(1/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = 2B`\n\n*   **Case 2: Ro-Vibrational Transition `(v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1)`**\n    `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n    `ΔE_rovib = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B`\n\nTypically, the rotational energy spacing (`2B`) is much smaller than the vibrational energy spacing (`ħω`). This means the pure rotational transition requires significantly less energy. Therefore, the true \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is `(v=0, J=1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Necessary Values and Photon Momentum\n\nLet's calculate the numerical values to confirm our assumption and find the photon momentum `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n**Constants and Given Values:**\n*   `Mx = 20 amu`, `My = 2 amu`. (1 amu ≈ 1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg)\n*   `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n*   `ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s`\n*   `ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n*   `c = 3 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Reduced Mass (`μ`):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 amu = (20/11) amu`\n    `μ ≈ (1.818) * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n2.  **Moment of Inertia (`I`):**\n    `I = μR² = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n    `I = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) = 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n3.  **Rotational Energy Term (`2B`):**\n    `2B = 2 * (ħ² / 2I) = ħ² / I`\n    `2B = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.2 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n4.  **Vibrational Energy Term (`ħω`):**\n    `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n**Momentum Calculation for Both Cases:**\n*   **Photon for Rotational Transition:** `p_rot = ΔE_rot / c = (2B) / c ≈ (9.2 x 10⁻²³ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 3.1 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`\n*   **Photon for Ro-Vibrational Transition:** `p_rovib = ΔE_rovib / c = (ħω + 2B) / c ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\n### Step 5: Final Analysis and Answer Selection\n\nComparing our calculated momenta with the given options:\nA) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nB) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nD) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated momentum for the pure rotational transition (`~3.1 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`) does not match any option. However, the momentum for the ro-vibrational transition (`~1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`) is a perfect match for option A.\n\n**Conclusion:** Although the wording \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" strictly implies the pure rotational transition, the numerical options provided force us to conclude that the question is asking for the momentum required for the lowest-energy *ro-vibrational* transition from the ground state (`v=0, J=0` to `v=1, J=1`). The energy for this transition is `ΔE = ħω + 2B`, which is dominated by the `ħω` term.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n`p = ΔE / c ≈ ħω / c`\n`p = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) = 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to find the energy of the transition. The molecule is initially in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) quantum numbers.\n\nThe energy levels of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by:\nEᵥ,ⱼ = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)] * J(J+1)\n\nWhere:\n*   v is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   J is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration (4 * 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\nThe problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" While the absolute lowest energy transition from the ground state would be a purely rotational one (from J=0 to J=1), the inclusion of the vibrational frequency (ω) in the problem data, combined with the provided options, strongly suggests that a rovibrational transition is intended.\n\nThe selection rules for an allowed rovibrational transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next lowest rovibrational state that can be reached is (v=1, J=1).\n\nThe energy of the transition (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial states:\n*   Initial state energy (v=0, J=0): E_initial = ħω(0 + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)]*0*(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   Final state energy (v=1, J=1): E_final = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)]*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is therefore:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = ( (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ) - ( (1/2)ħω ) = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThis energy is related to the photon's momentum (p) by the equation ΔE = pc, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s).

While the rotationally excited state `(v=0, J=1)` is lower in energy, the problem gives a vibrational frequency and the answer choices are of a magnitude that suggests a more energetic transition. Standard selection rules for photon absorption by a diatomic molecule are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`. Starting from `J=0`, the only possibility for `ΔJ` is `+1`.

Model and Energy Levels\nThe molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a particular state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J+1)\n\nwhere:\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   ω is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   B is the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / 2I`\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\nThe fundamental (ground) state is where `v=0` and `J=0`.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\nFor a photon to be absorbed and induce a transition, spectroscopic selection rules must be followed. For rovibrational transitions in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n\nStarting from the ground state (`v=0`, `J=0`), the molecule must transition to the next vibrational level (`v=1`). The selection rule `ΔJ = ±1` means the rotational quantum number `J` must change to `J=1` (as `J=-1` is not possible).\n\nTherefore, the transition is from the initial state `(v=0, J=0)` to the final state `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\nThe energy of the initial state is:\nE_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\nThe energy of the final state is:\nE_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these two levels:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = ħω + 2B\n\nThis energy can be approximated as just `ħω` because the rotational energy (`2B`) is typically much smaller than the vibrational energy (`ħω`).\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\nFirst, we calculate the energy jump due to vibration `ħω`:\n*   ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   **ΔE ≈ ħω** = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ s⁻¹) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 5. Calculating Photon Momentum (p)\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the equation `p = E/c`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\n*   p ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n(Note: A more precise calculation would include the rotational energy term `2B = ħ²/I`. First, the reduced mass `μ` is calculated as `(Mx*My)/(Mx+My)` = 1.818 amu or 3.02 x 10⁻²⁷ kg. The moment of inertia `I = μR²` is then `(3.02 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`. This gives a rotational energy correction that is very small compared to the vibrational energy and does not change the result to two significant figures.)\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to identify the initial and final energy states of the molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n**1. Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state for both vibration and rotation. This corresponds to a vibrational quantum number `v = 0` and a rotational quantum number `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" requires exciting the molecule. There are two possibilities: a pure rotational transition or a rovibrational transition.\n    *   A pure rotational transition (v=0 → v=0, J=0 → J=1) has a very low energy, typically in the microwave region of the spectrum.\n    *   A rovibrational transition involves changing both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. Given the magnitude of the options, the question is referring to a transition to the next vibrational level, which requires significantly more energy and corresponds to infrared absorption.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed, the transition must obey certain selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a diatomic molecule, the rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition to the next vibrational level (v=1) is to the rotational state J=1 (since J cannot decrease). Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n**2. Energy Calculation**\n\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J(J+1)\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number.\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number.\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\n\nΔE = E(final) - E(initial)\nΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)\nΔE = [(1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1)] - [(0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1)]\nΔE = [3/2 ħω + 2B] - [1/2 ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia (I).\n\n**3.

The photon's momentum (p) is then found using the relation p = ΔE / c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels of the Rovibrational Model\n\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For rovibrational spectroscopy of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules for an allowed transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Since the initial vibrational state is `v = 0`, the next vibrational state must be `v = 1`.\n    *   Since the initial rotational state is `J = 0`, the only possible change is ΔJ = +1, leading to a final rotational state of `J = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nFirst, we find the energy of the initial and final states:\n*   **E_initial** = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final** = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these states:\n*   **ΔE** = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I) ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\n**a. Calculate the Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass for a diatomic molecule with atomic masses Mx and My is:\n*   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n*   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n*   Converting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b.
