The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n    *   A) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\n2.  **Determine the DoU from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\n    Adding these up, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **6**.\n\n3.  **Compare and Eliminate Options:**\n    *   The calculated DoU from the spectroscopic data is 6.\n    *   This matches the DoU for options A (C11H12O2) and C (C12H14O2).\n    *   We can eliminate options B (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group. The proton adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton. The second vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 group. This fragment is **-CH=CH-CH3**, which has a formula of **C3H5**.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second -CH3 signal must come from the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or similar. To have a methyl group and no methylene groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula:**\n    Let's add the formulas of the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester part: C2H3O2\n\n    Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    Total Oxygens = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option A. It is not possible to construct a molecule with the formula C12H14O2 that fits all the given NMR constraints (especially the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the specific vinyl splitting).\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we can systematically deduce its structure from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C₆H₄. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals for aromatic hydrogens, suggesting a symmetrical substitution pattern like a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This tells us the compound contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the C₆H₄ group. (4 hydrogens)\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment adds C₃H₅ to the molecule (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal comes from the `-CH=CH-CH₃` group identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH₂ signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (–COOCH₃) or an acetate group (CH₃COO–). Both possibilities add a CH₃ group. (3 hydrogens)\n    *   **No –CH₂ group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n### Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the molecule and calculate its formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens)\n*   **Ester Group:** This group has two possible connectivities, but both lead to the same formula.\n    *   **Case 1: Methyl ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-COOCH₃`. The `-COOCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n    *   **Case 2: Acetate ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-OOCCH₃`. The `-OOCCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms for the entire molecule:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds: three in the ring, one vinyl, and one carbonyl), which is consistent with the proposed structure. The other options can be ruled out as they do not match the atom count derived from the detailed NMR analysis, particularly the constraint of having no -CH₂- groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** We will break down the information from FTIR and 1H NMR to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of only two signals for aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which gives a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** There are two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the `-CH3` is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment is a propenyl group, `C3H5`.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are two `-CH3` signals. We've already identified one in the propenyl group. This means there is one other `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No -CH2- Groups:** This is a critical constraint that helps eliminate potential structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** We will combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and count the atoms to find its chemical formula.\n    *   Fragment 1: `C6H4` (para-substituted benzene ring)\n    *   Fragment 2: `-COO-` (ester group)\n    *   Fragment 3: `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group)\n    *   Fragment 4: `-CH3` (a second methyl group)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the other methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the other methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The assembled formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We'll calculate the DoU from both the structure and the formula to ensure they match.\n    *   **DoU from structure:** 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6\n    *   **DoU from formula C11H12O2:** `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6`\n    The DoU values match, confirming our structure is plausible.\n\n4.  **Select the Final Answer:** We will compare our derived formula with the given options. The formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the information to identify molecular fragments.\n# Aromatic ring: Di-substituted with 2 H signals implies a para-substituted C6H4 ring.\n# FTIR: An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n# Vinyl group: A doublet and a doublet of quartets in the vinyl region indicates a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n# Methyl groups: Two -CH3 signals are observed.

This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the compound contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). All the given formula options have O2, which is consistent.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Total Signals:** Six distinct signals, meaning there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution, which would give an AA'BB' system appearing as two doublets. This accounts for a C6H4 fragment and 4 protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals. Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons, i.e., a methyl group (giving the quartet).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for 5 protons (1H + 1H + 3H).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The other methyl group must be a separate substituent. This accounts for 3 protons.\n    *   **-CH2 Groups:** No signals. This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates any structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other groups with a -CH2- unit.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n2.  An ester linkage: -COO-\n3.  A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n4.  A methyl group: -CH3\n\nWe need to combine these fragments into a single molecule. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the two substituents must be attached to the C6H4 ring.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the alcohol part (-COO-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **propenyl 4-methylbenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n*   **Possibility B:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the acid part (-OOC-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **4-methylphenyl 2-butenoate**. This structure is also consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the assembled structure.**\n\nLet's calculate the chemical formula for either of the possible structures, as they are isomers and will have the same formula. We will use propenyl 4-methylbenzoate.\n\n*   **Count the Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 1\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (C=O): 1\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   **Total Carbon = 1 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 11**\n*   **Count the Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 3\n    *   From the benzene ring: 4\n    *   From the propenyl group: 5 (1+1+3)\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12**\n*   **Count the Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   From the ester group: 2\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\n*   A) C12H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points Check:**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C11H12O2, DBE = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This perfectly matches the structure: 4 for the benzene ring, 1 for the C=C double bond, and 1 for the C=O double bond.\n*   **Check other options:**\n    *   C11H14O2 (DBE=5): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H12O2 (DBE=7): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H14O2 (DBE=6): While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- signals in the NMR, ruling this option out.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is my reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. This structure itself accounts for a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **1H NMR shows vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This adds another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total DoU required for the molecule is the sum of these contributions: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation). I will use a Python script to calculate this for each option to ensure accuracy.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d+)', formula)\n        counts = {el: int(num) for el, num in parts}\n        C = counts.get('C', 0)\n        H = counts.get('H', 0)\n        # DoU = C + 1 - H/2\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return dou\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    expected_dou = 6\n    print(f\"Expected DoU based on structure: {expected_dou}\")\n    for label, formula in options.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {label} ({formula}): DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\n    ```\n    \n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    Expected DoU based on structure: 6\n    Option A (C11H12O2): DoU = 6\n    Option B (C11H14O2): DoU = 5\n    Option C (C12H14O2): DoU = 6\n    Option D (C12H12O2): DoU = 7\n    ```\n    This calculation eliminates options B and D, as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or C (C12H14O2).\n\n3.  **Detailed Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** For a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals typically indicate a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern, which results in chemical symmetry. This means the ring fragment is C6H4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the first vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by its neighbor. The proton on the second vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One signal is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which would be a doublet. The other signal must come from the ester part of the molecule. Since there are no `-CH2-` groups, this cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). It must be a methyl group, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, this fragment is `CH3`.\n    *   **No -CH2- groups:** This is a crucial constraint.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the fragments identified from the NMR data:\n    *   Aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   Propenyl group: `C3H5`\n    *   Ester group: `-COO-` -> `CO2`\n    *   Second methyl group: `CH3`\n\n    Total Carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (methyl) = 11\n    Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl) = 12\n    Total Oxygen atoms = 2 (ester)\n\n    The molecular formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Check and Elimination:**\n    *   The derived formula `C11H12O2` matches option A.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate option C (`C12H14O2`). To get from `C11H12O2` to `C12H14O2`, we would need to add one carbon and two hydrogens, which is a `-CH2-` group. However, the problem explicitly states there are no signals for `-CH2-` groups. Therefore, `C12H14O2` is incorrect.\n    *   Another way to disprove `C12H14O2` is by proton count. Total protons = 14. The fragments we identified (`C6H4`, `-CH=CH-CH3`) account for 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) = 9 protons. This leaves 14 - 9 = 5 protons to be accounted for by the second methyl signal. A methyl signal must integrate to a multiple of 3 (e.g., 3H, 6H), so 5 protons is impossible.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only formula that fits all the given data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part is C₆H₄. The ring itself accounts for four degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-). This group contains one carbon, two oxygen atoms, and a carbon-oxygen double bond, which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** The absence of signals for –CH₂ groups is a crucial constraint, eliminating many possible structures, such as those containing ethyl or propyl chains.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution, which would result in two distinct proton environments.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). The combined splitting results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This propenyl group (-C₃H₅) adds one more degree of unsaturation from its carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-C**H₃**).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no –CH₂ groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOC**H₂**CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOC**H₃**) or an acetate group (-OCOC**H₃**).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and calculate its formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n*   **Ester and second Methyl Group:** This must be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂). Both possibilities have the same atomic count.\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from C₂H₃O₂)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation:**\nThe formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a degree of unsaturation of 6.\n(DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6).\nThe proposed structure contains:\n*   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees)\n*   1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 degree)\n*   1 ester C=O double bond (1 degree)\nThe total degrees of unsaturation for the structure is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6, which matches the calculated value from the formula.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously points to a molecular structure with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option B. Examples of such a compound would be methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically identifying its structural fragments.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents (a C₆H₄ group). The presence of only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which results in a symmetrical structure with two equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ester Group and Methyl Signals**: The FTIR shows an ester. The ¹H NMR shows two -CH₃ signals and, crucially, no -CH₂ signals. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any longer-chain ester would contain -CH₂ groups. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) to avoid any -CH₂ signals. This accounts for one of the two -CH₃ signals observed.\n    *   **Vinyl and Second Methyl Group**: The remaining signals are two vinyl protons (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and a second -CH₃ group. This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). In this fragment, the vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. The methyl group is split by one vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. This accounts for the two vinyl signals and the second -CH₃ signal.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can deduce the structure and its chemical formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Substituent 1 (Ester)**: -COOCH₃ (which contains C₂H₃O₂)\n*   **Substituent 2 (Vinyl group)**: -CH=CH-CH₃ (which contains C₃H₅)\n\nThe complete structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nSumming the atoms from all fragments:\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula corresponds to the identified structure, which is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The formula for this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR data:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, accounting for the \"O2\" part of the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** This provides the most detailed information about the substituents.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures that contain a methylene group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet. This confirms the presence of a –CH=CH–CH3 substituent. This group contains one of the two required –CH3 signals.\n    *   **Finding the second –CH3 group:** The ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl signal can be explained by a methyl ester functional group (–COOCH3). This structure provides the second –CH3 signal and does not contain any –CH2 groups.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para-substitution, where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n4.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and a methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n    *   Let's sum the atoms to find the molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the C6H4 ring) + 1 (from the –COO– group) + 1 (from the –OCH3 group) + 3 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 carbons.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from the –OCH3 group) + 4 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 hydrogens. Let's re-count the hydrogens on the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3 has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 hydrogens. So, the total hydrogen count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (ester methyl) + 5 (propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify against the options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   **C11H14O2:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH2CH2CH3), which would introduce –CH2 signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H12O2 and C12H14O2:** These formulas would require adding more carbons and hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the clear interpretation of the NMR signals that perfectly account for a C11H12O2 structure without any –CH2 groups.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond. This adds -COO- to our molecular fragments, which consists of 1 Carbon and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** The NMR spectrum gives the most detailed clues about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a high degree of symmetry. This is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (X-C6H4-Y), the four protons form an AA'BB' system, which typically resolves into two signals (often two doublets). This accounts for the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by both H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description and confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified. This methyl group is coupled to a vinyl proton, so its signal would be a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since we have an ester group and no other place for a methyl group (as there are no -CH2- groups), it must be part of the ester. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is not adjacent to any protons, so its signal would be a singlet.\n        *   This accounts for two distinct -CH3 signals.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    Based on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n    *   An ester group that incorporates a methyl group.\n\n    There are two plausible ways to connect these fragments:\n    *   **Possibility A: Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**\n        The propenyl group and the methyl ester group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–COOCH3\n    *   **Possibility B: 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate**\n        The propenyl group and the acetate group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–OOCCH3\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula for these structures.\n    *   **For both structures:**\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n        *   Propenyl group (C3H5): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n        *   Ester part (COO) + Methyl part (CH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the options provided:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n    Let's quickly check why the other options are incorrect:\n    *   **C11H14O2:** Compared to C11H12O2, this formula has two extra hydrogens. This would imply the absence of the C=C double bond in the propenyl group (making it a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). A propyl group contains -CH2- signals, which are explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to our derived C11H12O2. Again, this is ruled out by the absence of -CH2- signals.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra carbon atom compared to C11H12O2. It is not possible to add another carbon atom to the proposed structure without either introducing a -CH2- group or violating the other NMR signal constraints.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly fits all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aromatic Ring Information:**\n    *   The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of para (1,4) substitution. This high degree of symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent, simplifying the spectrum to two signals (typically two doublets). This C6H4 fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Group Information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group**. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. This accounts for the O2 part of all the proposed chemical formulas.\n    *   The ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals for the Substituents:**\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there is a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with a hydrogen attached to each carbon. The signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\".\n        *   A **doublet** means a proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** means a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a), so its signal would be a doublet.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (giving a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (giving a quartet). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description. So, one of the substituents on the ring is a propenyl group. This group has the formula -C3H5 and accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals.\n\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent.\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the other substituent, which we know is an ester.\n\n    *   **Absence of -CH2 Groups:** The spectrum has \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates possibilities like ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Pieces and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a **para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)**.\n    *   One substituent is a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that contains a methyl group. The only way to form this without a -CH2- group is to have a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OOCCH3)**. Both of these fragments have the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Let's combine these fragments to build the whole molecule. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Now, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11 Carbons**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   For C11H12O2, DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Our proposed structure has:\n        *   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n        *   1 C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n        *   1 C=O double bond in the ester group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n    *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The calculated DBE matches the structure, confirming its validity.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The deduced formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For instance, C11H14O2 would have a DBE of 5, and C12 formulas would require an additional carbon atom, which cannot be accommodated without violating the NMR data constraints (e.g., by adding a CH2 group).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Structure Information:**\n    *   **Core:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens. The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** group.\n    *   **FTIR:** The spectrum shows an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals to Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) arrangement.\n    *   **Vinyl-H and one -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) along with one of the -CH3 signals. This is a classic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Second -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows a second, distinct -CH3 signal. Since we know from the FTIR that there is an ester, this methyl group must be part of that ester functionality (e.g., a methyl ester, -COOCH3, or an acetate ester, -OCOCH3). This fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the overall formula.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence.

Incorrect. This formula lacks the C=C double bond required by the vinyl-H signals.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. Incorrect. This formula is equivalent to C11H12O2 + a CH2 group. The NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. Incorrect.

The 1H NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. This fragment accounts for **C6H4**.\n\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This adds **2 oxygen atoms** and a carbonyl group (C=O) to the structure.\n\n3.  **Vinyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This specific splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. This fragment contains **C3H5** and a C=C double bond.\n\n4.  **Methyl Groups:** The 1H NMR shows two -CH3 signals.\n    *   One -CH3 group is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n    *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH2- signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester. It must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). In either case, this part of the molecule contributes **C1H3**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Fragments:** Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 1 (from ester carbonyl C) + 1 (from ester methyl C) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from ester methyl H) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n6.  **Molecular Formula:** The assembled structure gives a molecular formula of **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   From the structure: 1 ring (DBE=1) + 3 double bonds in the ring (DBE=3) + 1 C=C double bond (DBE=1) + 1 C=O double bond (DBE=1) = **Total DBE of 6**.\n    *   From the formula C11H12O2: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   The DBE matches, confirming the formula is correct.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, C11H12O2 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically analyzing its constituent parts.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Proton (¹H) Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** The prompt describes a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals for aromatic protons. This pattern, often an AA'BB' system, is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring, which has a total of 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons—one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). This group contains 2 vinyl protons.\n    *   **Methyl (-CH₃) Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups. One signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) substituent. The other methyl signal must belong to the ester group, as no other structural source is suggested. Since the problem states there are no methylene (`-CH₂`) groups, this methyl must be directly attached to the ester functionality (i.e., a methyl ester or an acetyl group). Each methyl group contributes 3 protons, for a total of 6 protons from these two groups.\n    *   **Total Protons:** Summing these up gives a total of 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 protons.\n\n2.  **Carbon Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The `-CH=CH-CH₃` group adds 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The NMR data indicates a methyl group is part of this functionality, with no adjacent `-CH₂` groups. This leads to two possibilities for the ester substituent: a methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these groups contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester) = 11 carbons.\n\n3.  **Oxygen Count:**\n    *   The ester functional group (`-COO-`) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element, the molecular formula is determined to be **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information. Compounds such as (E)-methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate are isomers that fit this formula and the spectral data described.\n\nThis eliminates the other options:\n*   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂`: Incorrect carbon count.\n*   `C₁₂H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts, and would likely contain `-CH₂` groups, which are explicitly absent.\n*   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect hydrogen count and would imply a saturated alkyl chain instead of a propenyl group, contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a C₆H₄ group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed clues about the attached groups.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures with ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃).\n        *   The proton on the middle carbon is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The proton on the terminal carbon (attached to the ring) is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This confirms one of the substituents is a propenyl group (–C₃H₅), which also accounts for one of the two –CH₃ signals.\n    *   **Assembling the second substituent:** We still need to place the ester group (–COO–) and the second –CH₃ group. The only way to do this without creating a –CH₂– group is to form a methyl ester (–COOCH₃). This accounts for the second –CH₃ signal.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different groups, such as a propenyl group and a methyl ester group, would show distinct signals for the aromatic protons, consistent with the \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" description (likely an AA'BB' system if para-substituted).\n\n4.  **Construct the Molecule and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring: C₆H₄\n    *   We have a propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH₃ (which is C₃H₅)\n    *   We have a methyl ester group: –COOCH₃ (which is C₂H₃O₂)\n\n    Now, let's add up the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from ester)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃), which would introduce –CH₂– signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Adding another carbon or a carbon and two hydrogens without introducing a –CH₂– group and while keeping the other NMR-defined fragments is not feasible. For instance, adding a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring, particularly a para-substituted one where the two substituents are different.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** The absence of signals for –CH2 groups is a critical constraint, eliminating many possible structures.\n    *   **Two –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The signals for a doublet and a doublet of quartets are characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl hydrogen, resulting in a doublet. The second vinyl hydrogen is split by the first vinyl hydrogen (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), which results in a doublet of quartets. The methyl group of this substituent would appear as a doublet, accounting for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n    *   **The second –CH3 group:** This methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH2 groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH3). This accounts for the second –CH3 signal, which would appear as a singlet.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule consists of:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   A propenyl group (–CH=CHCH3).\n    *   A methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the methyl ester group) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the benzene ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: 1+1+3) + 3 (from the methyl ester group) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    This matches the structural features: 4 for the aromatic ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n\nComparing this calculated formula to the given options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the functional groups and basic structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula C6H4. This structure accounts for 4 aromatic protons. The 1H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is consistent with the 4 protons of a di-substituted ring (for example, a para-substituted ring often shows two doublets).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure -COO-. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O2) in the molecular formula.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate certain structural possibilities.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR signals in detail:**\n    *   **Two –CH3 signals:** Since there is an ester group and no –CH2 groups, one of the methyl groups must be part of a methyl ester (–COOCH3). An ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3) is ruled out because it contains a –CH2 group. The other –CH3 group must be part of the second substituent on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). The splitting pattern of a doublet (d) and a doublet of quartets (dq) is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (making it a quartet). Hence, a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a –CH=CH–CH3 group. This group also accounts for the second –CH3 signal, which would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structural fragments and determine the molecular formula:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Methyl ester group: –COOCH3\n    *   Propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH3\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O–CH3) + 3 (from –CH=CH–CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 3 (from O–CH3) + 5 (from –CH=CH–CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from –COO–) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\nThe derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A. All the spectroscopic data are consistent with a structure like methyl propenylbenzoate, which has this formula.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two aromatic-H signals:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) that is di-substituted has four protons remaining on the ring (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the protons on opposite sides of the ring are chemically equivalent, leading to two distinct signals, typically appearing as two doublets.\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to another group with no protons (like the aromatic ring).\n    *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n*   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is from the propenyl (-CH=CH-**CH₃**) group identified above. The second methyl signal must come from the other substituent.\n*   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint that eliminates any structures containing a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Absorption peaks indicating an ester group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This group must also incorporate the second methyl group identified in the NMR. The two possibilities for an ester containing a methyl group but no methylene group are:\n    1.  A **methyl ester** group (-COOCH₃).\n    2.  An **acetate** group (-OCOCH₃).\n\n### 3. Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound consists of the following fragments:\n\n*   A **para-substituted benzene ring**: C₆H₄\n*   A **propenyl group**: -CH=CH-CH₃ (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n*   An **ester group containing one methyl group**: This can be either -COOCH₃ or -OCOCH₃, both of which have a formula of C₂H₃O₂.\n\nCombining these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n\nC₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part) = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n\nThis formula corresponds to structures like (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate. Both of these structures are consistent with all the provided spectral data and have the same molecular formula. A search in chemical databases confirms that the molecular formula for (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate is indeed C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** This formula would require an additional CH₂ group compared to the derived formula, which is contradicted by the NMR data.\n*   **B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula would require an additional carbon atom without additional hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the identified fragments.\n*   **C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** This formula perfectly matches the composition derived from the detailed analysis of the NMR and FTIR spectra.\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula has two extra hydrogens, which would imply the saturation of the propenyl double bond, but the NMR data clearly indicates the presence of vinyl protons.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to determine the molecular formula of an unknown compound from a list of choices, using its spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data - Piece by Piece:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells me the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two things attached to it. A benzene ring is C6H6. When it's di-substituted, two hydrogens are replaced, so the ring itself is a C6H4 fragment. The 1H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\", which is typical for a symmetrical di-substituted ring (like a para-substituted one), accounting for the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring.\n        *   Fragment 1: C6H4. (6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens).\n\n    *   **\"FTIR ... shows ... an ester group\"**: An ester functional group is R-COO-R'. This group contains one carbonyl carbon (C=O) and one ether-like oxygen.\n        *   Fragment 2: -COO- group. (1 Carbon, 2 Oxygens).\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. The splitting pattern is key.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) means that proton is being split by one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and by three other equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This is a classic pattern for a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` system. Specifically, the H attached to the carbon that's also attached to the CH3.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is a \"doublet\" (d), meaning it's only split by one other proton (the first vinyl proton).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This group has 2 vinyl protons and 3 methyl protons.\n        *   Fragment 3: -CH=CH-CH3. (3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens).\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We've already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. There must be a second one.\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. Where does the second CH3 group belong? It must be part of the ester. For an ester (R-COO-R'), if we had an ethyl group (e.g., -COOCH2CH3), we would see a -CH2- signal. Since there isn't one, the alkyl part of the ester must be a methyl group (-CH3). So, the ester is a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`).\n        *   Fragment 4: The second -CH3 group, which is part of the ester. (1 Carbon, 3 Hydrogens).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Pieces and Calculate the Formula:** Now, I'll sum up all the atoms from the identified fragments.\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 1 (from -COO-) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's CH3 group) = 11 Carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's CH3 group) = 12 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the -COO- ester group).\n    *   **Total Formula:** C11H12O2.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n    *   My calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n5.  **Final Verification (Sanity Check):** Does the structure `propenyl-C6H4-COOCH3` fit all the data?\n    *   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n    *   Ester: Yes (-COOCH3).\n    *   Aromatic H: Yes (4H, 2 signals if para).\n    *   Vinyl H: Yes (2H, a `d` and a `dq`).\n    *   CH3 groups: Yes, two of them (one from propenyl, one from methyl ester).\n    *   No CH2 groups: Yes, there are none.\n    *   Total Signals: 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6 signals. This matches the data.\n    The logic holds up perfectly. The answer is C. Now, I will format this logic into the requested Python code block.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the chemical formula of a compound based on spectroscopic data.\n# I will break down the data to identify the structural fragments and then sum their atoms to get the molecular formula.\n\nprint(\"Let's determine the molecular formula step-by-step by analyzing the spectroscopic data.\")\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the core structure from the description.\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 1: Analyze the Aromatic Ring ---\")\nring_carbons = 6\nring_hydrogens = 4\nprint(f\"The compound is a 'di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring'.\")\nprint(f\"This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogens have been replaced by other groups.\")\nprint(f\"This core structure is C6H4, contributing {ring_carbons} carbons and {ring_hydrogens} hydrogens.\")\nprint(\"The 'two signals corresponding to aromatic-H' in the 1H NMR spectrum is consistent with the 4 hydrogens on this C6H4 ring.\")\n\n# Step 2: Identify the functional groups from FTIR and NMR.\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 2: Identify the Functional Groups ---\")\n# Ester group\nester_oxygens = 2\nester_carbonyl_carbons = 1\nprint(f\"The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-).

This means it is a benzene ring with two substituents (R1 and R2). The base formula for this core is C6H4.\n2.  **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group is present. This means the molecule contains a -COO- functional group.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. If they give only two signals, it implies symmetry. A 1,4- (para) substitution pattern results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to two signals (typically two doublets). This is the most likely substitution pattern.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with protons attached. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**. This proton is coupled to two different sets of protons: one single proton (causing the doublet split) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, causing the quartet split).\n        *   This specific pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the central carbon is split by the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons (dq), while the terminal vinyl proton is split only by the central vinyl proton (d). This substituent has the formula -C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl substituent identified above.\n        *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of any methylene (-CH2-) groups in the molecule. This means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), propyl ester, etc.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\n*   **Fragment 1 (Core):** A para-disubstituted benzene ring, **-C6H4-**.\n*   **Fragment 2 (Substituent 1):** A propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. Its formula is **-C3H5**.\n*   **Fragment 3 (Substituent 2):** An ester group that contains a methyl group but no methylene group. The two possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**.\n    *   An acetate group: **-O-CO-CH3**.\n    *   In either case, this fragment contributes two oxygen atoms, two carbon atoms, and three hydrogen atoms. The formula contribution is **-C2H3O2**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total molecular formula.**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to get the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the result with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).**\n\nThe DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Formula-based DoU:** For C11H12O2, DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n*   **Structure-based DoU:** The deduced structure has:\n    *   A benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   A vinyl C=C double bond = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An ester C=O double bond = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Total = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\nThe DoU from the formula matches the DoU from the structure, confirming the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (Incorrect, implies fewer double bonds/rings)\n*   B) C12H14O2 (Incorrect formula and would require a -CH2- group, which is absent)\n*   C) C12H12O2 (Incorrect, has a different C count and would require an additional degree of unsaturation)\n*   D) C11H12O2 (Correct)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data allows for the step-by-step deduction of the compound's structure and, consequently, its molecular formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR and FTIR Data to Identify Key Structural Fragments\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The problem states the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of two signals for aromatic protons (Aromatic-H) suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para-) substituted benzene ring. This accounts for a **C₆H₄** core.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This group contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows two vinyl protons with specific splitting patterns: one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq). This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon bonded to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first one, giving a doublet. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the second substituent.\n*   **Absence of -CH₂- Groups:** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for methylene (-CH₂-) groups. This is a critical constraint that eliminates possibilities like ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other alkyl chains containing a -CH₂- unit.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in the molecule. Based on our identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring = 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O) = 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C) = 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nThe code execution calculated the DBE for each of the possible formulas:\n*   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 6\n*   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 6\n*   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 7 (Incorrect)\n*   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 5 (Incorrect)\n\nThis calculation eliminates options C and D, leaving A and B as possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nLet's combine the pieces we've identified to construct the full molecule and find its formula:\n1.  **C₆H₄** (di-substituted benzene core)\n2.  **-CH=CH-CH₃** (propenyl group, one substituent)\n3.  An ester group and a methyl group must form the second substituent without creating any -CH₂- groups. The only way to do this is to form a methyl ester, **-COOCH₃**.\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these assembled parts:\n*   From C₆H₄: 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n*   From -CH=CH-CH₃: 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n*   From -COOCH₃: 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   Oxygens: 2\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula matches option B. It has the correct DBE of 6 and accounts for all the features observed in the spectra, including the crucial absence of -CH₂- groups. Option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) has the correct DBE but contains an extra CH₂ unit, which would produce a signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum, contradicting the given information.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n### Deciphering the Molecular Formula through Spectral Analysis\n\nBy meticulously analyzing the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data, the chemical formula for the unknown di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound can be determined.\n\n#### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Hydrogen Count from 1H NMR:** The spectrum provides crucial information for determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two signals in the aromatic region, characteristic of a di-substituted benzene ring, strongly suggest a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This accounts for 4 hydrogen atoms (4H).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** The presence of a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the two vinyl protons is a classic pattern for a prop-1-enyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This indicates there are 2 vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH3) groups. One of these belongs to the prop-1-enyl group, and the other must be part of another substituent. These two methyl groups account for a total of 6 hydrogen atoms (3H + 3H).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** The explicit absence of signals for methylene (-CH2) groups is a key constraint.\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** Summing these up (4 aromatic H + 2 vinyl H + 3 vinyl-methyl H + 3 other-methyl H) gives a total of 12 hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Options based on Hydrogen Count:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible.**\n    *   C) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\n    *   D) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible.**\n\n3.  **Determining the Carbon Count and Degree of Unsaturation:** To differentiate between the remaining possibilities (B and D), we can assemble the molecular structure from the spectral data and calculate its degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU is the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Structural Components:**\n        *   A di-substituted (para) benzene ring (C6H4). This has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing 4 to the DoU.\n        *   An ester group (-COO-), confirmed by FTIR. The C=O double bond adds 1 to the DoU.\n        *   A prop-1-enyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The C=C double bond adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation from Structure:** The total DoU is 4 (from the ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from C=C) = 6.\n\n4.  **Cross-checking with Formulas:** Now, we calculate the DoU for the remaining possible formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   **For C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This **matches** the DoU derived from the structure.\n    *   **For C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This **does not match** the DoU derived from the structure.\n\nThis inconsistency eliminates C12H12O2. The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided data is C11H12O2. Two plausible structures for C11H12O2 that fit the data are methyl p-(prop-1-enyl)benzoate and prop-1-enyl p-toluate, both of which have the same molecular formula.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe detailed analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum indicates the molecule contains exactly 12 hydrogen atoms. The structural features inferred from the spectra correspond to a degree of unsaturation of 6. Only the molecular formula C11H12O2 satisfies both of these conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n\n2.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, having the base formula C6H4. The fact that the 1H NMR spectrum shows only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester or a propyl group.\n    *   **Two –CH3 signals:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The splitting patterns provide the structure of this group. A doublet of quartets for one vinyl-H indicates it is coupled to another vinyl-H (creating the doublet) and a methyl group (creating the quartet). A doublet for the other vinyl-H indicates it is coupled to only the first vinyl-H. This pattern uniquely identifies a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** One substituent is the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which accounts for the vinyl signals and one of the -CH3 signals. The second substituent is an ester. To account for the second -CH3 signal without introducing any -CH2- groups, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula Calculation:** The identified structure is methyl p-propenylbenzoate. Let's calculate its molecular formula:\n    *   Aromatic ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n    *   Methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option C. Other isomers with the formula C11H12O2, such as ethyl cinnamate or cinnamyl acetate, can be ruled out because their NMR spectra would not match the given data (e.g., cinnamyl acetate has a -CH2- group and ethyl cinnamate has both a -CH2- group and a monosubstituted aromatic ring).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2. This is determined by systematically breaking down the information provided by the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core structure is therefore a C₆H₄ group.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring contains 4 aromatic protons. The presence of two distinct signals suggests a specific substitution pattern, such as para-substitution, which would give two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these ester-containing fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This confirms the absence of ethyl or other methylene-containing fragments.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula:\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, the total molecular formula can be calculated:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester/Methyl Group:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming the atoms from each fragment:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThus, the final chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches possible structures like methyl 4-propenylbenzoate or 4-propenylphenyl acetate, both of which are consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR spectrum:** Provides detailed information about the hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule.\n        *   \"six signals\": This means there are six chemically distinct types of protons.\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\": A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. Having two signals for these 4 protons is characteristic of a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern, which would show two doublets. Total aromatic protons = 4H.\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\": This is a classic pattern for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n            *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). The combined splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This fragment contains two vinyl protons (2H) and a methyl group (3H).\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\": We have already identified one methyl group from the propenyl fragment. The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. For it to be a simple methyl group signal and for the compound to have no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities add a methyl group (3H).\n        *   \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\": This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Determine the total number of hydrogen atoms:**\n    Based on the 1H NMR data, we can sum the number of protons:\n    *   Aromatic protons: 4H\n    *   Vinyl protons: 2H\n    *   Methyl protons: There are two distinct methyl groups, so 2 * 3H = 6H.\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12H.**\n\n    This allows us to eliminate options with a different number of hydrogens.\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (14H) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (12H) - Possible.\n    *   C) C12H12O2 (12H) - Possible.\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (14H) - Incorrect.\n\n3.  **Determine the total number of carbon and oxygen atoms:**\n    Now we assemble the molecular fragments identified from the spectra and count the atoms to distinguish between the remaining options (B and C).\n    *   **Aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl group:** -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Ester group part:** This part must contain the second methyl group.\n        *   Possibility 1: A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This fragment contains C2H3O2.\n        *   Possibility 2: An acetate group, `-OCOCH3`. This fragment also contains C2H3O2.\n    *   **Assembling the full molecule:** The structure consists of the C6H4 ring substituted with the propenyl group (C3H5) and the ester part (C2H3O2).\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms** = 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen atoms** = **2 oxygens** (from the ester group).\n\n4.  **Conclude the molecular formula:**\n    Based on the atom count, the molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    This matches option B and eliminates option C (C12H12O2).\n\n5.  **Final Verification (Degree of Unsaturation):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a useful check.\n    *   **DoU from formula (C11H12O2):** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   **DoU from structure:** The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DoU = 4), one C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and one C=O double bond (DoU = 1). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming the consistency of the derived structure and formula.\n\nAll evidence points to the molecular formula being C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group\". An ester has the functional group -COO-. This adds at least one carbon and two oxygen atoms to the formula.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum gives crucial information about the types of protons and their arrangement.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C carbons, H hydrogens, and O oxygens is:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n    Let's calculate the DBE for the structural features we know:\n    *   Aromatic ring: 1 ring and 3 double bonds = 4 DBE.\n    *   Ester group (-COO-): Contains one C=O double bond = 1 DBE.\n    *   Vinyl-H signals: This indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) = 1 DBE.\n\n    The total DBE required by the described structure is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given options:\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (Possible)\n    *   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (Possible)\n\n    Based on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options A and B. We are left with C and D.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data in Detail:**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring gives two signals for its 4 aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first one, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment has the formula -C₃H₅.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\"**: One methyl group (-CH₃) comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must be located elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**: This is a critical piece of information. It rules out any ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or similar alkyl chains.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   One substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), which provides the vinyl signals and one of the methyl signals. This fragment is -C₃H₅.\n    *   The other substituent must be the ester group and contain the second methyl group, with no -CH₂- groups. The two simplest possibilities for the ester part are:\n        1.  A methyl ester group: -COOCH₃.\n        2.  An acetate group: -O-CO-CH₃.\n    *   Let's test these possibilities by calculating the total formula:\n        *   **Structure 1 (Methyl Ester):** The substituents are -CH=CH-CH₃ and -COOCH₃.\n            *   Formula = C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + CH₃ (from ester) + CO₂ (ester carbonyls) = C(6+3+1)H(4+5+3)O₂ = **C₁₀H₁₂O₂**.

The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** fragment.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an \"ester group.\" An ester has the general formula R-COO-R' and contributes two oxygen atoms (**O2**) to the molecular formula.\n    *   **1H NMR (Vinyl-H):** The spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals with specific splitting patterns: \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets.\" This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This substituent has a formula of **C3H5**.\n    *   **1H NMR (-CH3):** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups.\"\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group we just identified.\n        *   The other methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n    *   **1H NMR (No -CH2-):** The information that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\" is critical. It means that the ester cannot be, for instance, an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), because that would contain a -CH2- group. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, making it either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OCOCH3)**. In either case, this entire fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the total formula (C+H3 from the methyl part, and C+O2 from the ester core).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Total Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** C3H5\n    *   **Ester-Methyl Group:** C2H3O2\n\n    Let's add them together:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** This formula matches our detailed analysis.\n    *   B) C11H14O2: Incorrect number of hydrogens.\n    *   C) C12H12O2: Incorrect number of carbons.\n    *   D) C12H14O2: Incorrect number of carbons and hydrogens.

This fragment is `-C6H4-`.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is only split by the first one, giving a doublet (d).\n    *   **Two –CH3 group signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information. It eliminates possibilities like ethyl esters (`-COOCH2CH3`) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   The spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (`-COO-`). Combined with the NMR data, this ester group must involve the second methyl group, suggesting either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-O-CO-CH3`) functionality.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A para-phenylene group: `-C6H4-`\n    *   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group: Either `-COOCH3` or `-O-CO-CH3`\n\n    Let's assemble these on the para-substituted benzene ring. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate:\n    `CH3-CH=CH-` (propenyl) attached to a `C6H4` ring, which is also attached to `-COOCH3` (methyl ester).\n\n4.  **Determine the Chemical Formula from the Deduced Structure:**\n    Let's count the atoms in the proposed structure (methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate):\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from -OCH3) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 5 (from propenyl) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from -OCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE confirms the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   From the structure: 1 (ring) + 3 (pi bonds in ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = **DBE of 6**.\n    *   From the options:\n        *   A) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n        *   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6  **(Matches)**\n        *   C) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    Both B and D have the correct DBE. However, to get from C11H12O2 (our deduced structure) to C12H14O2, one would need to add a `CH2` group. The problem statement explicitly says there are **no signals for –CH2 groups**, which rules out option D.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. A benzene ring itself has a DBE of 4 (one ring and three double bonds). The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group (-COO-), which contains a C=O double bond, adding 1 to the DBE. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two signals for vinyl-H, indicating the presence of a C=C double bond, which adds another 1 to the DBE.\n    *   Total DBE = 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DBE for each possible formula:** The formula for DBE is `C - H/2 + 1` (ignoring the oxygen atoms as they don't affect the calculation).\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n    *   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. This matches the required DBE.\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. This matches the required DBE.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n\n    Based on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options A and D. We are left with C11H14O2 and C11H12O2. Let's recheck the calculation for B. C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. So B and C are possible based on DBE alone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals for aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with a para (1,4) substitution pattern would give two distinct signals due to symmetry. This accounts for `C6H4`.\n    *   **Vinyl Region:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The hydrogen on the carbon next to the ring would be split by the other vinyl hydrogen (doublet). The other vinyl hydrogen would be split by the first vinyl hydrogen (doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment accounts for `C3H5` (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** There are two signals for -CH3 groups. One of these is accounted for by the propenyl group. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since the compound has no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`). Both of these contain a methyl group.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2-:** The explicit mention of no signals for -CH2- groups is a crucial clue.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`.\n    *   We have a propenyl substituent: `-C3H5`.\n    *   We have an ester that includes a methyl group. Let's assume a methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`. This accounts for `C2H3O2`.\n\n    Let's assemble these pieces into a final structure: `methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate`.\n    The total formula is the sum of the parts: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + COOCH3 (methyl ester group).\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (methyl ester) = 11 Carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl ester) = 12 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (ester) = 2 Oxygens.\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Check:**\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n    *   The DBE for C11H12O2 is 6, which is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   The structure derived from the NMR data has no -CH2- groups.\n    *   Let's consider option B (C12H14O2). To get from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2, we would need to add a `CH2` group. However, the problem states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, which makes C12H14O2 impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the given spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we can systematically analyze the provided spectral data to determine its constituent fragments.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Structure and FTIR:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means it has a `C6H4` core. The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (`-COO-`).\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of two signals for these 4 protons is characteristic of a para (1,4) substituted ring, which would show two doublets due to symmetry. This confirms the `C6H4` fragment. (Total protons so far: 4)\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (2 signals):** There are two signals for vinyl protons (hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond). The splitting patterns—one doublet and one doublet of quartets—are a classic indicator of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton appears as a doublet. This fragment is `-C₃H₅`. (Total protons so far: 4 + 2 = 6)\n    *   **Methyl Protons (2 signals):** The spectrum shows two signals for methyl (`-CH₃`) groups.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) fragment identified above.\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since the data indicates no `-CH₂` groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these fragments contribute one methyl group and have the formula `-C₂H₃O₂`. (Total protons so far: 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 12)\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This crucial piece of information rules out fragments like ethyl groups, confirming the assignment of the ester as a methyl ester or acetate.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we combine the atoms from each identified fragment to determine the total molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** `C₆H₄`\n*   **Propenyl Group:** `C₃H₅` (This includes one vinyl -CH=CH- and one -CH₃)\n*   **Ester Fragment:** `C₂H₃O₂` (This includes the -COO- and the second -CH₃)\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds within the ring, one vinyl double bond, and one carbonyl double bond), which is consistent with the proposed structure.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe deduced formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core formula for this part of the molecule is C6H4.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Functional Groups:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an **ester group** (-COO-). This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows signals for vinyl protons, which indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) outside the aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2 signals):** This is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond) that are coupled to each other is indicated.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**, which means it is split by only one neighboring proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**. This complex splitting pattern is very informative. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton. The \"quartet\" part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The vinyl proton splitting pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) strongly indicates a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** is one of the substituents. This fragment contains one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (2 signals):** The compound has two distinct methyl (-CH3) groups. One is part of the propenyl group just identified. The other must be part of the second substituent.\n    *   **No Methylene Protons (no -CH2- signals):** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 aromatic ring.\n    *   Substituent 1 is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   Substituent 2 must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3), with no methylene (-CH2-) groups. The most logical structure for this is a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This group has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11 carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12 hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This molecular formula is consistent with all the provided spectral data. For instance, a compound like methyl 4-propenylbenzoate would fit this description.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The aromatic part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR data:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** This is the most informative part for determining the substituents.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. Whatever the substituents are, they cannot contain a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a double bond with a proton on each carbon (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Vinyl-H splitting:** One vinyl-H is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   Let's label the protons: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b), so it appears as a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three H(c) protons (a quartet). Thus, H(b) appears as a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms one substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This group adds **C3H5** to the formula and contains no -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these -CH3 groups is the one in the propenyl substituent. Its protons (c) are split by H(b), so they would appear as a doublet. This accounts for one -CH3 signal.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the other substituent, which also contains the ester group.\n    *   **The second substituent:** We need to form an ester group that includes a -CH3 group but has no -CH2- group. There are two possibilities:\n        *   An **acetoxy group**: -O-CO-CH3.\n        *   A **carbomethoxy group**: -CO-O-CH3.\n        *   Both of these groups fit the criteria: they are esters, contain a methyl (-CH3) group (which would appear as a singlet in the NMR spectrum), and have no methylene (-CH2-) groups. Both of these groups add **C2H3O2** to the formula.\n\n4.  **Assemble the final formula:** Now, we combine the parts we have identified:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): C2H3O2\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2\n\nThe final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Match with the options:**\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure Skeleton:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C₆H₄.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:** The IR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two signals for aromatic protons. For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other side, resulting in just two distinct signals (often two doublets).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two signals for vinyl protons.\n        *   One is a **doublet**, meaning it is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**, meaning it is coupled to two different sets of protons: one proton (causing the doublet split) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH₃ group, causing the quartet split).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula -C₃H₅.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One -CH₃ group is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The second -CH₃ signal, combined with the fact that there is an ester and no -CH₂ groups, strongly points to a **methyl ester** (-COOCH₃). This accounts for the ester group from the IR and the second methyl group. The formula for this substituent is -CO₂CH₃, which is C₂H₃O₂.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂):** The spectrum explicitly shows **no signals** for -CH₂ groups. This is a critical constraint, ruling out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure:\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **-C₃H₅**\n*   A methyl ester group: **-C₂H₃O₂**\n\n### Calculating the Molecular Formula:\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from each fragment to determine the total molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from methyl ester)\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A search confirms that a potential structure fitting this data, (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, has this exact molecular formula.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nComparing our calculated formula with the given options:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:** I'll break down the spectroscopic data to identify the structural fragments of the molecule.\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells me the core structure is a benzene ring (C6) with two other groups attached.\n    *   **FTIR: Ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This means the molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms, which all the options do.\n    *   **1H NMR Signal Analysis:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** On a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four ring protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is C6H4.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and one -CH3 signal:** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`. The H next to the ring is split by the other vinyl H and the methyl group (doublet of quartets), and the terminal vinyl H is split only by the other vinyl H (doublet). This fragment consists of C3H5.\n        *   **A second -CH3 signal:** We've already accounted for one methyl group in the propenyl fragment. The ester group is `R-COO-R'`. The second methyl group signal, combined with the fact that there are *no* `-CH2-` signals, points to the `R'` part of the ester being a simple methyl group. Thus, we have a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`. This fragment adds C1, H3, and O2 to the part of the ester that is not the methyl group itself.\n        *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that confirms the methyl ester idea. If it were an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, we would see a -CH2- signal.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:** Now, I will put all the identified pieces together and sum up the atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** `C6H4`\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl group):** `-CH=CH-CH3` which is `C3H5`\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Methyl ester group):** `-COOCH3` which is `C2H3O2`\n\n    Let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester)\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) C11H12O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n\n    My calculated formula, C11H12O2, perfectly matches option A.\n\n4.  **Final Code Generation:** I will write a Python script that programmatically represents this deduction process.

This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n2.  **FTIR Data:** There is an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms, and it also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n3.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **6 total signals:** This indicates there are 6 types of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents in the *para* (1,4) positions would typically show two signals (often two doublets). This is the most likely substitution pattern. This C6H4 group accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group.\n        *   The hydrogen on the carbon next to the CH3 group would be split by the adjacent vinyl hydrogen (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl hydrogen would be split only by its neighboring vinyl hydrogen, giving a doublet (d).\n        *   This propenyl group fragment is C3H5.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified.\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent.\n    *   **No -CH2- signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the molecular fragments.**\n\nWe have the following pieces to build our molecule:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring core (C6H4).\n*   An ester functional group (-COO-).\n*   A propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   A methyl group (-CH3) that is not part of the propenyl group.\n*   The constraint of no -CH2- groups.\n\nLet's assemble the two substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Substituent 1:** This is the propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n*   **Substituent 2:** This must contain the ester group and the second methyl group. To incorporate the -CH3 and -COO- fragments without creating a -CH2- group, there are two possibilities for how it attaches to the aromatic ring:\n    1.  A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n    2.  An acetate group: -OCOCH3\n\nBoth potential substituents, -COOCH3 and -OCOCH3, fulfill the conditions: they contain an ester, a methyl group, and no methylene group. Therefore, the overall structure is a benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group and either a -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3 group. A likely structure is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate or Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. Both of these structures fit all the spectral data provided.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total chemical formula.**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from the identified parts to find the molecular formula. The formula will be the same regardless of which of the two possible ester arrangements is correct.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n*   **Substituent 1 (propenyl group):** C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n*   **Substituent 2 (ester part):** This will be either -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3. In both cases, the fragment consists of C2H3O2.\n\nLet's add them up:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\n*   A) C12H12O2\n*   B) C11H14O2\n*   C) C12H14O2\n*   D) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points & Final Check:**\n\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** A good way to verify the result.\n    *   Formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Structure: Benzene ring (4 DoU) + one C=C double bond (1 DoU) + one C=O double bond (1 DoU) = 6 DoU. The DoU values match, confirming our structural analysis is consistent with the formula.\n*   **Ruled-out options:** The other options can be ruled out. C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 have too many hydrogens and would require -CH2- groups, which are explicitly stated to be absent. C12H12O2 has an extra degree of unsaturation that cannot be explained by the given NMR fragments.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the chemical formula of an unknown compound by interpreting its spectroscopic data. Here's a systematic breakdown of the information provided:\n\n1.  **Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents, giving a core structure of `C6H4`. The benzene ring itself accounts for 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which corresponds to 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This group contains a carbonyl bond (`C=O`), which adds 1 more degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectral Data:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two sets of aromatic protons is most commonly a 1,4-para substituted ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets):** This is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The double bond (`C=C`) in this group adds another degree of unsaturation. The fragment formula is `C3H5`.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One methyl group belongs to the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other methyl group must be part of the second substituent, the one containing the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial piece of information. The second substituent, which contains the ester group (`-COO-`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`), cannot contain any methylene (`-CH2-`) units. The only way to combine these pieces without a `-CH2-` is to form either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester attached through the oxygen (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, the fragment formula is `C2H3O2`.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic core: `C6H4`\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): `C3H5`\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester + methyl): `C2H3O2`\n\n    Adding these together:\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen:** 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU calculated from the proposed structure is: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the candidate formula `C11H12O2`: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming the consistency of our derived structure with the formula.\n\n    As confirmed by the code execution output, other formulas are inconsistent. C11H14O2 and C12H12O2 have the wrong DoU. C12H14O2 has the correct DoU but would require an additional `CH2` group compared to our structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on the information provided, we can deduce the structure and formula of the unknown compound step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The ¹H NMR shows two signals for aromatic hydrogens, which typically indicates a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern on a benzene ring. This accounts for a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This means the molecule contains two oxygen atoms, accounting for the **O₂** in the formula.\n\n3.  **Vinyl and Methyl Groups (¹H NMR):**\n    *   There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The other vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group. This fragment accounts for **C₃H₅** and one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   There is a second methyl group signal (-CH₃). Since the spectrum has no signals for methylene (-CH₂-) groups, this methyl group must be part of the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). This accounts for a **-CH₃** fragment.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nNow, we assemble these fragments to form a complete molecule that is a di-substituted aromatic ester. There are two primary possibilities that fit all the data:\n\n*   **Possibility 1: Methyl 4-propenylbenzoate**\n    *   Fragments: A 4-propenyl group (-C₃H₅) and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) are attached to the benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   Formula Calculation: C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: 4-propenylphenyl acetate**\n    *   Fragments: A 4-propenyl group (-C₃H₅) and an acetate group (-O-CO-CH₃) are attached to the benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   Formula Calculation: C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nBoth plausible structures consistent with all the given spectral information have the same molecular formula: C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Evaluating Other Options\n\n*   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** These formulas contain more hydrogen atoms, indicating fewer double bonds or rings (a lower degree of unsaturation). The presence of both an aromatic ring and a vinyl group is confirmed by the NMR, which contradicts the degree of unsaturation calculated for C₁₁H₁₄O₂. Constructing a molecule for C₁₂H₁₄O₂ that fits all NMR criteria (especially the \"no -CH₂ groups\" rule) is not feasible.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula has a higher degree of unsaturation than C₁₁H₁₂O₂, implying an additional ring or double bond, which is not supported by the provided NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that logically fits the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄). The presence of a benzene ring corresponds to four degrees of unsaturation.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond adds one degree of unsaturation.\n3.  **¹H NMR Data Breakdown:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents in a 1,4 (para) arrangement would typically show two signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The other vinyl proton is split by its vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group accounts for `C₃H₅`.\n    *   **Two -CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is from the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The second methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`). A methyl ester group is consistent with the FTIR data and introduces another `-CH₃` group. The chemical shift for a methyl ester is typically around 3.7-4.1 ppm.\n    *   **No -CH₂ signals:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence, ruling out structures containing ethyl groups, propyl groups, or other moieties with methylene (`-CH₂`) protons.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n*   A propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH₃` (C₃H₅).\n*   A methyl ester group, `-COOCH₃` (C₂H₃O₂).\n\nThe most likely structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the assembled parts:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from benzene) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from benzene) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A search confirms that the common name for this compound is (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and its molecular formula is indeed C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Evaluating the Options Using Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (ignoring halogens and including oxygen as neutral).\n\nThe proposed structure has a benzene ring (4 DoU), a C=C bond (1 DoU), and a C=O bond (1 DoU), for a total of **6 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's check the DoU for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This is incorrect. Furthermore, to have 14 hydrogens, the propenyl group would need to be saturated to a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), which would introduce two `-CH₂` signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n*   **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. While the DoU matches, getting to C₁₂ and H₁₄ from the correct C₁₁H₁₂ structure would require adding a `-CH₂` group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**. This matches the expected DoU and all the spectral data align perfectly with a structure corresponding to this formula.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This corresponds to a C₆H₄- group.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (CO₂). The carbonyl (C=O) in the ester is a source of one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Six signals in total.\n        *   Two aromatic-H signals suggest a substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a -CH=CH-CH₃ group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment accounts for C₃H₅ and provides one of the two -CH₃ signals.\n        *   Two separate signals for -CH₃ groups. We've identified one in the -CH=CH-CH₃ group. The other must come from the second substituent.\n        *   **No signals for -CH₂ groups.** This is a critical piece of information for eliminating incorrect structures.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The information from the spectra indicates the presence of:\n    *   A benzene ring (4 DoU)\n    *   A carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl group, 1 DoU)\n    *   A carbon-oxygen double bond (ester group, 1 DoU)\n    The total degrees of unsaturation for the molecule must be 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n3.  **Check the DoU for each possible formula:**\n    The formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For a CₓHᵧO₂ compound, this simplifies to DoU = (2x + 2 - y) / 2.\n    *   A) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = (2*11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6. This matches our calculated DoU.\n    *   B) **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = (2*11 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5. This does not match.\n    *   C) **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = (2*12 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7. This does not match.\n    *   D) **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = (2*12 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6. This also matches our calculated DoU.\n\n4.  **Differentiate between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:**\n    We must use the remaining NMR information, specifically the absence of a -CH₂- signal, to distinguish between the two possibilities.\n\n    *   **For C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (Option A):**\n        Let's assemble the fragments we've identified:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n        *   Propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃ (C₃H₅)\n        *   Ester group and the second methyl group. The remaining atoms are C₁₁H₁₂O₂ - C₆H₄ - C₃H₅ = C₂H₃O₂.\n        *   The fragment C₂H₃O₂ perfectly corresponds to an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). This provides the ester function and the second -CH₃ signal.\n        *   A plausible structure would be **propenylphenyl acetate**. This molecule contains a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and importantly, **no -CH₂- groups**. Thus, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a valid candidate.\n\n    *   **For C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D):**\n        Let's assemble the fragments for this formula:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n        *   Propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃ (C₃H₅)\n        *   Ester group and the second methyl group. The remaining atoms are C₁₂H₁₄O₂ - C₆H₄ - C₃H₅ = C₃H₅O₂.\n        *   We need to form a substituent from C₃H₅O₂ that contains an ester and a methyl group. A plausible candidate is an ethyl ester group, **-COO-CH₂-CH₃**. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅O₂.\n        *   However, the ethyl ester group contains a **-CH₂- group**. The NMR data explicitly states there are no signals for -CH₂- groups. Any other arrangement of C₃H₅O₂ to form an ester substituent (like a propanoate group, -O-CO-CH₂-CH₃) would also contain a -CH₂- group.\n        *   Therefore, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ is not a valid candidate as any structure consistent with the other data would have to contain a -CH₂- group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectral data, particularly the degrees of unsaturation and the absence of any -CH₂- signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum, the only possible chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds. We can deduce the required DoU from the structural information provided:\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, so its DoU is 4.\n    *   An ester group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, contributing 1 to the DoU.\n    *   The NMR spectrum shows two vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a C=C double bond, which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for each formula option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`, where C, H, and N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. For a formula CₓHᵧO₂, this simplifies to `DoU = x - y/2 + 1`. The python script has already performed this calculation:\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = **6**\n\n    Based on the DoU calculation, we can eliminate options B and C, as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. We are left with options A (C11H12O2) and D (C12H14O2).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure from NMR Data:** Now we use the detailed ¹H NMR information to build the molecule's fragments and determine the atom count.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The spectrum shows two signals for aromatic protons. This is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring, which has the formula **-C₆H₄-**.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The presence of two vinyl proton signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) along with one of the methyl signals strongly suggests a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester group (-COO-). The NMR shows a second -CH₃ signal and importantly, **no -CH₂- signals**. This means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or anything larger. It must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **-C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Sum the Atoms of the Fragments:** Let's add up the atoms from the fragments we identified:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The assembled structure directly from the spectroscopic evidence gives a chemical formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option A. A structure corresponding to C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D) would require an additional -CH₂- unit, which would produce a -CH₂- signal in the NMR spectrum, contradicting the given information.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **Compound Type:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** \"absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\" confirms the presence of a –COO– functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Aromatic Region:** \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is a strong indicator of a *para*-substitution pattern (1,4-disubstituted) on the benzene ring. An unsymmetrical ortho or meta substitution would give four signals. A symmetrical para substitution gives two signals. This means we have 4 aromatic protons in total, divided into two chemically different sets.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Vinyl Region:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. The splitting pattern described (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a propenyl group, specifically **–CH=CH–CH₃**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃`.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the three protons of the CH₃ group into a quartet. This results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This fragment accounts for two vinyl proton signals and one of the methyl group signals.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Alkyl Region:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\". One of these methyl signals belongs to the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃) identified above. The second methyl signal must belong to the only other part of the molecule we know: the ester group. For an ester to contain a methyl group and no CH₂ groups, it must be either a methyl ester (**–COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**–OOCCH₃**).\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Key Constraint:** \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\" This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n    Based on the analysis, we can assemble the pieces:\n    *   A *para*-substituted benzene ring: **p-C₆H₄**\n    *   A propenyl group: **–CH=CH–CH₃**\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group: either **–COOCH₃** or **–OOCCH₃**\n\n    Let's combine these fragments. The two possible structures are:\n    *   **Structure I:** Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate\n    *   **Structure II:** 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate\n\n    Both structures perfectly fit all the given spectroscopic data (para-disubstituted ring, ester, propenyl group signals, two distinct methyl signals, and no CH₂ signals).\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n\n    Now, we calculate the molecular formula for the structure we've deduced. Since both possible structures are isomers, they will have the same formula.\n\n    Let's count the atoms in Structure I (Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate):\n    *   **Benzene ring (C₆H₄):** 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   **Propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃):** 3 Carbons, (1+1+3) = 5 Hydrogens\n    *   **Methyl ester group (–COOCH₃):** (1+1) = 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total:**\n        *   Carbons (C) = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n        *   Hydrogens (H) = 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n        *   Oxygens (O) = **2**\n\n    The chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify Against the Options:**\n\n    The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches one of the given options. Let's briefly check why the others are incorrect.\n\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (DBE=6):** This is our derived formula. The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is 6 (4 for the ring, 1 for C=C, 1 for C=O), which matches the structure.\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DBE=5):** Has two more hydrogens than our structure. Adding two hydrogens would require removing a double bond. Saturating the propenyl's C=C bond would create a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃), which introduces forbidden –CH₂– signals.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DBE=7):** Has an extra C and an extra degree of unsaturation. It's not possible to add a carbon and a double bond/ring to our structure without violating the NMR constraints (e.g., creating a tri-substituted ring or adding more vinyl signals).\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DBE=6):** Has the same DBE as our structure but contains an additional C and 2H (a CH₂ unit). Adding a CH₂ unit is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. For example, changing the methyl ester to an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃) would yield this formula but would also show a –CH₂– signal.\n\n    Therefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structural Core and Functional Groups**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the base of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The ring itself contributes a **C6H4** fragment to the molecule.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group**: An ester functional group (R-COO-R') contains two oxygen atoms. This means the molecular formula will end in **O2**. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this finding.\n\n**2. Decode the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify the Substituents**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We will identify the two substituents attached to the C6H4 ring.\n\n*   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H**: A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The fact that these four protons give only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a 1,4- (or para-) substitution.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)**: This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n    *   Let's visualize this fragment attached to the ring: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The proton H(b) is split by the adjacent H(a) into a doublet, and it is also split by the three protons of the -CH3 group into a quartet. This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   The proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This confirms one substituent is a propenyl group. Let's count its atoms: **C3H5**.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups**: The molecule has two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n    *   We have already identified one as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n    *   The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent.\n*   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**: This is a crucial piece of negative information. The second substituent contains the ester group and a methyl group but **cannot** contain a methylene (-CH2-) unit. The only simple way to construct this is as a **methyl ester group (-COOCH3)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, is ruled out because it contains a -CH2- group. The formula for the methyl ester fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n\n*   Aromatic Ring: **C6H4**\n*   Substituent 1 (Propenyl group): **C3H5**\n*   Substituent 2 (Methyl ester group): **C2H3O2**\n\nLet's calculate the total:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe final molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option B.\n\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An absorption peak for an ester group (–COO–) is present. An ester group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). Having only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a para (1,4) substitution. This would give two sets of two equivalent protons.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This specific splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n            *   Let's label the group as `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to the adjacent proton H(b), so its signal is a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` substituent. This group also provides one of the two methyl signals.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one methyl group from the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out many common alkyl groups like ethyl (–CH2CH3) or propyl (–CH2CH2CH3). For the ester group, it rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3).\n\n2.  **Piece together the molecular structure:**\n    *   **Core:** A para-substituted benzene ring (p-C6H4).\n    *   **Substituent 1:** A propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group and no methylene (–CH2–) group. The two possibilities are:\n        *   A methyl ester group: –COOCH3\n        *   An acetoxy group: –O–CO–CH3\n    *   Both possibilities fit the given data. Let's build a potential structure: methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. The other possibility is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Determine the chemical formula from the deduced structure:**\n    Let's sum the atoms for the identified fragments:\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group substituent: C3H5\n    *   Ester substituent (either –COOCH3 or –OOCCH3): C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Formula:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O(2) = **C11H12O2**\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (DBE=4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (DBE=1) + 1 ester C=O bond (DBE=1) = **Total DBE = 6**.\n    *   **From the formula C11H12O2:** Using the formula DBE = C + 1 - (H/2), we get DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DBE from the structure and the formula match, confirming our deduction.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    Let's calculate the DBE for each option to see which ones are plausible. The correct formula must have a DBE of 6.\n    \n    ```python\n    def calculate_dbe(C, H):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the degrees of unsaturation.\"\"\"\n        return C - H/2 + 1\n\n    # DBE for the proposed structure is 6 (ring=4, C=C=1, C=O=1)\n    print(f\"The DBE required by the spectral data is 6.\")\n\n    # Option A: C11H14O2\n    dbe_A = calculate_dbe(11, 14)\n    print(f\"Option A (C11H14O2) has DBE = {dbe_A}\")\n\n    # Option B: C12H12O2\n    dbe_B = calculate_dbe(12, 12)\n    print(f\"Option B (C12H12O2) has DBE = {dbe_B}\")\n\n    # Option C: C12H14O2\n    dbe_C = calculate_dbe(12, 14)\n    print(f\"Option C (C12H14O2) has DBE = {dbe_C}\")\n\n    # Option D: C11H12O2\n    dbe_D = calculate_dbe(11, 12)\n    print(f\"Option D (C11H12O2) has DBE = {dbe_D}\")\n    ```\n\n    *   The DBE for C11H14O2 is 5. This is incorrect.\n    *   The DBE for C12H12O2 is 7. This is incorrect.\n    *   The DBE for C12H14O2 is 6. This is plausible based on DBE alone.\n    *   The DBE for C11H12O2 is 6. This is plausible based on DBE alone.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    We must choose between C11H12O2 (Option D) and C12H14O2 (Option C). Our detailed structural analysis based on the NMR splitting patterns led directly to the formula C11H12O2. It is not possible to construct a C12H14O2 molecule that fits all the specific constraints (especially the propenyl splitting pattern and the absence of –CH2– signals). Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides the most direct clues to the number and types of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, which is essential for determining the chemical formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** The spectrum shows two signals corresponding to aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) has four hydrogen atoms attached to it (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution.\n    *   Number of aromatic hydrogens = 4\n\n*   **Vinyl Hydrogens:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens (-CH=CH-). The splitting patterns (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) are characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), where the two vinyl protons split each other, and one is further split by the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   Number of vinyl hydrogens = 2\n\n*   **Methyl Hydrogens (-CH₃):** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups. One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**) identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   Number of hydrogens in two -CH₃ groups = 2 × 3 = 6\n\n*   **Methylene Hydrogens (-CH₂):** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH₂ groups.\n    *   Number of methylene hydrogens = 0\n\n### 2. Calculating the Total Number of Hydrogens\n\nBy summing the hydrogens from each part of the molecule identified by the ¹H NMR spectrum, we can find the total number of hydrogens in the molecular formula.\n\n*   Total Hydrogens = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H)\n*   Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = **12**\n\nThis calculation immediately eliminates options C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and D (C₁₁H₁₄O₂), as they both contain 14 hydrogen atoms. The correct formula must be either C₁₁H₁₂O₂ or C₁₂H₁₂O₂.\n\n### 3. Assembling the Molecular Structure to Count Carbons\n\nNow, let's determine the number of carbon atoms by piecing together the structural fragments.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A benzene ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-), which contains 1 carbon atom.\n*   **Molecular Skeleton from ¹H NMR:**\n    *   The two vinyl hydrogens belong to two carbon atoms (-**C**H=**C**H-).\n    *   The two methyl groups contribute two more carbon atoms (2 × -**C**H₃).\n\nLet's sum the carbon atoms from these identified fragments:\n\n*   Total Carbons = (Aromatic Ring C) + (Ester C) + (Vinyl C) + (Methyl C)\n*   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **11**\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to a molecule containing 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms (from the ester group).\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 11\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 12\n*   **Oxygen atoms:** 2\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis corresponds to structures like *methyl p-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate* or *p-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate*, both of which fit all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Components from the Spectra:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of only two signals for aromatic hydrogens in the ¹H NMR spectrum strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two sets, leading to two distinct signals (often appearing as doublets). This aromatic core corresponds to a C₆H₄ unit.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-), which contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O bond. This group adds one carbon and two oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   **Vinyl and Methyl Groups:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split into a quartet by the -CH₃ and into a doublet by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, appearing as a doublet. This fragment accounts for one vinyl C=C bond, two vinyl hydrogens, and one of the two methyl groups mentioned. This propenyl group has a formula of -C₃H₅.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group:** The spectrum shows a second signal for a –CH₃ group. Since there are no –CH₂ signals, this methyl group cannot be part of a larger alkyl chain like an ethyl group. Given the presence of an ester, this second methyl is most likely part of a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). In either case, it's a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **No Methylene Groups:** The explicit absence of –CH₂ signals is crucial, as it rules out isomers containing ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains with methylene units. For example, ethyl cinnamate (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) is an isomer but would show -CH₂ signals.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon atoms:** 6 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 1 (from the -COO- ester carbonyl) + 3 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 1 (from the second CH₃ group) = 11 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the -C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from the second -CH₃ group) = 12 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from the -COO- ester group).\n\n    Combining these parts gives a molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A potential structure fitting this data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n3.  **Verify with Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula would have fewer double bonds or rings than indicated by the NMR (vinyl protons require a C=C bond in addition to the aromatic ring). This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** These formulas contain an additional carbon atom. To accommodate this and the NMR data, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ would need a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly ruled out. C₁₂H₁₂O₂ would require an additional degree of unsaturation (like another double bond or ring) which is not suggested by the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the spectral data uniquely and consistently point to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nAnalyse der spektralen Daten zur Bestimmung der Summenformel:\n\n1.  **Grad der Ungesättigtheit (Doppelbindungsäquivalente, DBÄ):**\n    *   Ein di-substituierter 6-gliedriger aromatischer Ring hat einen DBÄ von 4 (1 Ring + 3 Doppelbindungen).\n    *   Eine Estergruppe (-COO-) enthält eine Carbonylgruppe (C=O), was den DBÄ um 1 erhöht.\n    *   Die ¹H-NMR-Signale für Vinyl-H zeigen das Vorhandensein einer C=C-Doppelbindung an, was den DBÄ um ein weiteres 1 erhöht.\n    *   Der Gesamt-DBÄ der Struktur beträgt also 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n2.  **Berechnung des DBÄ für die gegebenen Optionen:**\n    Die Formel für den DBÄ lautet: DBÄ = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.

Es bleiben A (C12H14O2) und C (C11H12O2) übrig.\n\n3.  **Analyse der ¹H-NMR-Daten zur Bestimmung der Fragmente:**\n    *   **Aromatischer Teil:** Ein di-substituierter aromatischer Ring mit zwei Signalen für aromatische Protonen deutet auf eine symmetrische Substitution (z. B. para) mit insgesamt 4 aromatischen Protonen hin. Das Fragment ist **C6H4**.\n    *   **Vinyl-Teil:** Zwei Signale für Vinyl-H, ein Dublett und ein Dublett von Quartetts, sind charakteristisch für eine **Propenylgruppe (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Ein Vinylproton wird vom anderen zu einem Dublett aufgespalten. Das zweite Vinylproton wird vom ersten Vinylproton (Dublett) und von der benachbarten Methylgruppe (Quartett) zu einem Dublett von Quartetts aufgespalten. Dieses Fragment enthält 2 Vinyl-Protonen und eine CH3-Gruppe. Dies ist eines der beiden Methylsignale. Das Fragment ist **-C3H5** (2 Vinyl-H + 3 Methyl-H).\n    *   **Ester- und Methyl-Teil:** Das Spektrum zeigt zwei Signale für –CH3-Gruppen. Eines gehört zur Propenylgruppe. Das zweite muss Teil des Ester-Substituenten sein. Da es keine Signale für –CH2-Gruppen gibt, sind Ester wie Ethylester (-COOCH2CH3) ausgeschlossen. Die einzigen Möglichkeiten für ein esterhaltiges Fragment mit einer CH3-Gruppe und ohne CH2-Gruppen sind eine **Methylestergruppe (-COOCH3)** oder eine **Acetoxygruppe (-O-CO-CH3)**. Beide liefern ein Singulett für die Methylgruppe im NMR-Spektrum. Dieses Fragment ist **-C2H3O2** (3 Methyl-H + C + O2).\n\n4.  **Zusammensetzen der Fragmente zur Summenformel:**\n    *   Aromatischer Ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenylgruppe: C3H5\n    *   Ester-Methyl-Fragment: C2H3O2\n    *   **Summe:**\n        *   Kohlenstoff: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Wasserstoff: 4 (aromatisch) + 5 (Propenyl) + 3 (Ester-Methyl) = 12\n        *   Sauerstoff: 2\n    *   Die resultierende Summenformel ist **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Vergleich mit den verbleibenden Optionen:**\n    Die hergeleitete Formel C11H12O2 entspricht der Option C. Option A, C12H14O2, enthält ein zusätzliches Kohlenstoffatom und zwei zusätzliche Wasserstoffatome, was einer -CH2-Gruppe entsprechen würde, die durch die NMR-Daten explizit ausgeschlossen wird.\n\nDie Analyse aller spektroskopischen Daten führt eindeutig zur Summenformel C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided responses.\n\n### Step 1: Consolidate the Reasoning from the Agents\nThere is a clear and unanimous consensus among all agents regarding the chemical analysis of the spectroscopic data. The reasoning can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   The structure contains a 6-membered aromatic ring (DoU = 4), an ester group (C=O, DoU = 1), and a vinyl group (C=C, DoU = 1).\n    *   The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Calculating the DoU for the options:\n        *   C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. **(Match)**\n        *   C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Mismatch)\n        *   C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Mismatch)\n        *   C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. **(Match)**\n    *   This initial step reliably narrows down the possibilities to C11H12O2 and C12H14O2.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Fragment Analysis:**\n    *   **C6H4**: A di-substituted aromatic ring with 2 proton signals suggests a para-substituted ring.\n    *   **C3H5**: Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) are a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This also accounts for one of the methyl group signals.\n    *   **C2H3O2**: An ester group (FTIR) combined with the second methyl signal and the critical constraint of **no -CH2- signals** points to a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or acetate (`-OCOCH3`) fragment.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count**: A very effective approach used by several agents is to count the total protons directly from the NMR description: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (from two methyl groups) = 12 Hydrogens. This immediately eliminates C11H14O2 and C12H14O2.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Correct Chemical Formula\nAssembling the identified fragments (`C6H4` + `C3H5` + `C2H3O2`) consistently and unanimously leads to the chemical formula:\n*   Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   Oxygens: 2\n*   **Final Formula: C11H12O2**\n\n### Step 3: Final Verification and Decision\nThe formula C11H12O2 is consistent with all pieces of data. It has the correct DoU of 6 and the correct hydrogen count of 12. The other potential candidate with DoU=6, C12H14O2, is definitively ruled out because the difference between it and C11H12O2 is a `-CH2-` group, which is explicitly absent according to the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll agents correctly performed the chemical analysis and arrived at the formula **C11H12O2**. The variation in their final letter choice (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) is due to differences in the multiple-choice option ordering they were presented with. Based on the option list provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2**\n*   B) C11H14O2\n*   C) C12H14O2\n*   D) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct chemical formula, C11H12O2, corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n    *   A) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\n2.  **Determine the DoU from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group (-COO-):** The carbonyl (C=O) bond accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\n    Adding these up, the total required DoU for the molecule is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **6**.\n\n3.  **Compare and Eliminate Options:**\n    *   The calculated DoU from the spectroscopic data is 6.\n    *   This matches the DoU for options A (C11H12O2) and C (C12H14O2).\n    *   We can eliminate options B (DoU=5) and D (DoU=7).\n\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Fragments to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is **C6H4**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group. The proton adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton. The second vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3 group. This fragment is **-CH=CH-CH3**, which has a formula of **C3H5**.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second -CH3 signal must come from the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or similar. To have a methyl group and no methylene groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-OCOCH3**). Both of these fragments have the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Final Formula:**\n    Let's add the formulas of the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester part: C2H3O2\n\n    Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    Total Oxygens = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option A. It is not possible to construct a molecule with the formula C12H14O2 that fits all the given NMR constraints (especially the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the specific vinyl splitting).\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we can systematically deduce its structure from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C₆H₄. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals for aromatic hydrogens, suggesting a symmetrical substitution pattern like a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This tells us the compound contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the C₆H₄ group. (4 hydrogens)\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment adds C₃H₅ to the molecule (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal comes from the `-CH=CH-CH₃` group identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH₂ signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (–COOCH₃) or an acetate group (CH₃COO–). Both possibilities add a CH₃ group. (3 hydrogens)\n    *   **No –CH₂ group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n### Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the molecule and calculate its formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens)\n*   **Ester Group:** This group has two possible connectivities, but both lead to the same formula.\n    *   **Case 1: Methyl ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-COOCH₃`. The `-COOCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n    *   **Case 2: Acetate ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-OOCCH₃`. The `-OOCCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms for the entire molecule:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds: three in the ring, one vinyl, and one carbonyl), which is consistent with the proposed structure. The other options can be ruled out as they do not match the atom count derived from the detailed NMR analysis, particularly the constraint of having no -CH₂- groups.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** We will break down the information from FTIR and 1H NMR to identify the key structural fragments of the molecule.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of only two signals for aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which gives a `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** There are two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the `-CH3` is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment is a propenyl group, `C3H5`.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are two `-CH3` signals. We've already identified one in the propenyl group. This means there is one other `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No -CH2- Groups:** This is a critical constraint that helps eliminate potential structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** We will combine the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and count the atoms to find its chemical formula.\n    *   Fragment 1: `C6H4` (para-substituted benzene ring)\n    *   Fragment 2: `-COO-` (ester group)\n    *   Fragment 3: `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group)\n    *   Fragment 4: `-CH3` (a second methyl group)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the other methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the other methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The assembled formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We'll calculate the DoU from both the structure and the formula to ensure they match.\n    *   **DoU from structure:** 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6\n    *   **DoU from formula C11H12O2:** `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6`\n    The DoU values match, confirming our structure is plausible.\n\n4.  **Select the Final Answer:** We will compare our derived formula with the given options.

This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the compound contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). All the given formula options have O2, which is consistent.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Total Signals:** Six distinct signals, meaning there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution, which would give an AA'BB' system appearing as two doublets. This accounts for a C6H4 fragment and 4 protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals. Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons, i.e., a methyl group (giving the quartet).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for 5 protons (1H + 1H + 3H).\n    *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The other methyl group must be a separate substituent. This accounts for 3 protons.\n    *   **-CH2 Groups:** No signals. This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates any structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other groups with a -CH2- unit.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n2.  An ester linkage: -COO-\n3.  A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n4.  A methyl group: -CH3\n\nWe need to combine these fragments into a single molecule. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the two substituents must be attached to the C6H4 ring.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the alcohol part (-COO-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **propenyl 4-methylbenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n*   **Possibility B:** The substituents on the ring are the methyl group (-CH3) and an ester group where the propenyl group is the acid part (-OOC-CH=CH-CH3). This gives the structure **4-methylphenyl 2-butenoate**. This structure is also consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the assembled structure.**\n\nLet's calculate the chemical formula for either of the possible structures, as they are isomers and will have the same formula. We will use propenyl 4-methylbenzoate.\n\n*   **Count the Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 1\n    *   From the benzene ring: 6\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (C=O): 1\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   **Total Carbon = 1 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 11**\n*   **Count the Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   From the methyl group on the ring: 3\n    *   From the benzene ring: 4\n    *   From the propenyl group: 5 (1+1+3)\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12**\n*   **Count the Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   From the ester group: 2\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\n*   A) C12H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H14O2\n*   D) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points Check:**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C11H12O2, DBE = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This perfectly matches the structure: 4 for the benzene ring, 1 for the C=C double bond, and 1 for the C=O double bond.\n*   **Check other options:**\n    *   C11H14O2 (DBE=5): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H12O2 (DBE=7): Incorrect DBE.\n    *   C12H14O2 (DBE=6): While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- signals in the NMR, ruling this option out.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is my reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. This structure itself accounts for a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **1H NMR shows vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This adds another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total DoU required for the molecule is the sum of these contributions: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation). I will use a Python script to calculate this for each option to ensure accuracy.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d+)', formula)\n        counts = {el: int(num) for el, num in parts}\n        C = counts.get('C', 0)\n        H = counts.get('H', 0)\n        # DoU = C + 1 - H/2\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return dou\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    expected_dou = 6\n    print(f\"Expected DoU based on structure: {expected_dou}\")\n    for label, formula in options.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {label} ({formula}): DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\n    ```\n    \n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    Expected DoU based on structure: 6\n    Option A (C11H12O2): DoU = 6\n    Option B (C11H14O2): DoU = 5\n    Option C (C12H14O2): DoU = 6\n    Option D (C12H12O2): DoU = 7\n    ```\n    This calculation eliminates options B and D, as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or C (C12H14O2).\n\n3.  **Detailed Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** For a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals typically indicate a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern, which results in chemical symmetry. This means the ring fragment is C6H4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the first vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by its neighbor. The proton on the second vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One signal is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which would be a doublet. The other signal must come from the ester part of the molecule. Since there are no `-CH2-` groups, this cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). It must be a methyl group, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, this fragment is `CH3`.\n    *   **No -CH2- groups:** This is a crucial constraint.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the fragments identified from the NMR data:\n    *   Aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   Propenyl group: `C3H5`\n    *   Ester group: `-COO-` -> `CO2`\n    *   Second methyl group: `CH3`\n\n    Total Carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (methyl) = 11\n    Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl) = 12\n    Total Oxygen atoms = 2 (ester)\n\n    The molecular formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Check and Elimination:**\n    *   The derived formula `C11H12O2` matches option A.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate option C (`C12H14O2`). To get from `C11H12O2` to `C12H14O2`, we would need to add one carbon and two hydrogens, which is a `-CH2-` group. However, the problem explicitly states there are no signals for `-CH2-` groups. Therefore, `C12H14O2` is incorrect.\n    *   Another way to disprove `C12H14O2` is by proton count. Total protons = 14. The fragments we identified (`C6H4`, `-CH=CH-CH3`) account for 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) = 9 protons. This leaves 14 - 9 = 5 protons to be accounted for by the second methyl signal. A methyl signal must integrate to a multiple of 3 (e.g., 3H, 6H), so 5 protons is impossible.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only formula that fits all the given data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part is C₆H₄. The ring itself accounts for four degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-). This group contains one carbon, two oxygen atoms, and a carbon-oxygen double bond, which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** The absence of signals for –CH₂ groups is a crucial constraint, eliminating many possible structures, such as those containing ethyl or propyl chains.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution, which would result in two distinct proton environments.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). The combined splitting results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This propenyl group (-C₃H₅) adds one more degree of unsaturation from its carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-C**H₃**).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no –CH₂ groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOC**H₂**CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (-COOC**H₃**) or an acetate group (-OCOC**H₃**).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the complete molecule and calculate its formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n*   **Ester and second Methyl Group:** This must be either a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂). Both possibilities have the same atomic count.\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from C₂H₃O₂)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation:**\nThe formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a degree of unsaturation of 6.\n(DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6).\nThe proposed structure contains:\n*   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees)\n*   1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 degree)\n*   1 ester C=O double bond (1 degree)\nThe total degrees of unsaturation for the structure is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6, which matches the calculated value from the formula.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously points to a molecular structure with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option B. Examples of such a compound would be methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically identifying its structural fragments.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents (a C₆H₄ group). The presence of only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which results in a symmetrical structure with two equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ester Group and Methyl Signals**: The FTIR shows an ester. The ¹H NMR shows two -CH₃ signals and, crucially, no -CH₂ signals. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or any longer-chain ester would contain -CH₂ groups. Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) to avoid any -CH₂ signals. This accounts for one of the two -CH₃ signals observed.\n    *   **Vinyl and Second Methyl Group**: The remaining signals are two vinyl protons (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and a second -CH₃ group. This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). In this fragment, the vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. The methyl group is split by one vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. This accounts for the two vinyl signals and the second -CH₃ signal.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can deduce the structure and its chemical formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Substituent 1 (Ester)**: -COOCH₃ (which contains C₂H₃O₂)\n*   **Substituent 2 (Vinyl group)**: -CH=CH-CH₃ (which contains C₃H₅)\n\nThe complete structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nSumming the atoms from all fragments:\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula corresponds to the identified structure, which is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The formula for this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR data:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, accounting for the \"O2\" part of the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** This provides the most detailed information about the substituents.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures that contain a methylene group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet. This confirms the presence of a –CH=CH–CH3 substituent. This group contains one of the two required –CH3 signals.\n    *   **Finding the second –CH3 group:** The ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl signal can be explained by a methyl ester functional group (–COOCH3). This structure provides the second –CH3 signal and does not contain any –CH2 groups.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para-substitution, where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n4.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and a methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n    *   Let's sum the atoms to find the molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the C6H4 ring) + 1 (from the –COO– group) + 1 (from the –OCH3 group) + 3 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 carbons.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from the –OCH3 group) + 4 (from the –CH=CH–CH3 group) = 11 hydrogens. Let's re-count the hydrogens on the propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3 has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 hydrogens. So, the total hydrogen count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (ester methyl) + 5 (propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify against the options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   **C11H14O2:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH2CH2CH3), which would introduce –CH2 signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H12O2 and C12H14O2:** These formulas would require adding more carbons and hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the clear interpretation of the NMR signals that perfectly account for a C11H12O2 structure without any –CH2 groups.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond. This adds -COO- to our molecular fragments, which consists of 1 Carbon and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** The NMR spectrum gives the most detailed clues about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a high degree of symmetry. This is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (X-C6H4-Y), the four protons form an AA'BB' system, which typically resolves into two signals (often two doublets). This accounts for the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by both H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description and confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 group.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified. This methyl group is coupled to a vinyl proton, so its signal would be a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since we have an ester group and no other place for a methyl group (as there are no -CH2- groups), it must be part of the ester. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is not adjacent to any protons, so its signal would be a singlet.\n        *   This accounts for two distinct -CH3 signals.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    Based on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n    *   An ester group that incorporates a methyl group.\n\n    There are two plausible ways to connect these fragments:\n    *   **Possibility A: Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**\n        The propenyl group and the methyl ester group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–COOCH3\n    *   **Possibility B: 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate**\n        The propenyl group and the acetate group are attached to the benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions.\n        Structure: CH3-CH=CH–C6H4–OOCCH3\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula for these structures.\n    *   **For both structures:**\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n        *   Propenyl group (C3H5): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n        *   Ester part (COO) + Methyl part (CH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the options provided:\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n    Let's quickly check why the other options are incorrect:\n    *   **C11H14O2:** Compared to C11H12O2, this formula has two extra hydrogens. This would imply the absence of the C=C double bond in the propenyl group (making it a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). A propyl group contains -CH2- signals, which are explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra CH2 group compared to our derived C11H12O2. Again, this is ruled out by the absence of -CH2- signals.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** This formula has an extra carbon atom compared to C11H12O2. It is not possible to add another carbon atom to the proposed structure without either introducing a -CH2- group or violating the other NMR signal constraints.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly fits all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aromatic Ring Information:**\n    *   The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of para (1,4) substitution. This high degree of symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent, simplifying the spectrum to two signals (typically two doublets). This C6H4 fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Group Information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an **ester group**. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. This accounts for the O2 part of all the proposed chemical formulas.\n    *   The ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals for the Substituents:**\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there is a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with a hydrogen attached to each carbon. The signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\".\n        *   A **doublet** means a proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** means a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a), so its signal would be a doublet.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (giving a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (giving a quartet). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This perfectly matches the description. So, one of the substituents on the ring is a propenyl group. This group has the formula -C3H5 and accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals.\n\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent.\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the other substituent, which we know is an ester.\n\n    *   **Absence of -CH2 Groups:** The spectrum has \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates possibilities like ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Pieces and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a **para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4)**.\n    *   One substituent is a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that contains a methyl group. The only way to form this without a -CH2- group is to have a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OOCCH3)**. Both of these fragments have the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Let's combine these fragments to build the whole molecule. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Now, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11 Carbons**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   For C11H12O2, DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Our proposed structure has:\n        *   1 aromatic ring (4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n        *   1 C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n        *   1 C=O double bond in the ester group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n    *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The calculated DBE matches the structure, confirming its validity.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The deduced formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For instance, C11H14O2 would have a DBE of 5, and C12 formulas would require an additional carbon atom, which cannot be accommodated without violating the NMR data constraints (e.g., by adding a CH2 group).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Structure Information:**\n    *   **Core:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens. The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** group.\n    *   **FTIR:** The spectrum shows an **ester group** (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals to Identify the Substituents:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) arrangement.\n    *   **Vinyl-H and one -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) along with one of the -CH3 signals. This is a classic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Second -CH3 group:** The spectrum shows a second, distinct -CH3 signal. Since we know from the FTIR that there is an ester, this methyl group must be part of that ester functionality (e.g., a methyl ester, -COOCH3, or an acetate ester, -OCOCH3). This fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the overall formula.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence.

Incorrect. This formula lacks the C=C double bond required by the vinyl-H signals.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. Incorrect. This formula is equivalent to C11H12O2 + a CH2 group. The NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. Incorrect.

This fragment accounts for **C6H4**.\n\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This adds **2 oxygen atoms** and a carbonyl group (C=O) to the structure.\n\n3.  **Vinyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This specific splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. This fragment contains **C3H5** and a C=C double bond.\n\n4.  **Methyl Groups:** The 1H NMR shows two -CH3 signals.\n    *   One -CH3 group is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n    *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH2- signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester. It must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). In either case, this part of the molecule contributes **C1H3**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Fragments:** Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 1 (from ester carbonyl C) + 1 (from ester methyl C) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from ester methyl H) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n6.  **Molecular Formula:** The assembled structure gives a molecular formula of **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   From the structure: 1 ring (DBE=1) + 3 double bonds in the ring (DBE=3) + 1 C=C double bond (DBE=1) + 1 C=O double bond (DBE=1) = **Total DBE of 6**.\n    *   From the formula C11H12O2: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   The DBE matches, confirming the formula is correct.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, C11H12O2 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined by systematically analyzing its constituent parts.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Proton (¹H) Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** The prompt describes a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals for aromatic protons. This pattern, often an AA'BB' system, is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring, which has a total of 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons—one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). This group contains 2 vinyl protons.\n    *   **Methyl (-CH₃) Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups. One signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) substituent. The other methyl signal must belong to the ester group, as no other structural source is suggested. Since the problem states there are no methylene (`-CH₂`) groups, this methyl must be directly attached to the ester functionality (i.e., a methyl ester or an acetyl group). Each methyl group contributes 3 protons, for a total of 6 protons from these two groups.\n    *   **Total Protons:** Summing these up gives a total of 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 protons.\n\n2.  **Carbon Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The `-CH=CH-CH₃` group adds 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester (`-COO-`). The NMR data indicates a methyl group is part of this functionality, with no adjacent `-CH₂` groups. This leads to two possibilities for the ester substituent: a methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these groups contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester) = 11 carbons.\n\n3.  **Oxygen Count:**\n    *   The ester functional group (`-COO-`) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the counts for each element, the molecular formula is determined to be **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information. Compounds such as (E)-methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate are isomers that fit this formula and the spectral data described.\n\nThis eliminates the other options:\n*   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂`: Incorrect carbon count.\n*   `C₁₂H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts, and would likely contain `-CH₂` groups, which are explicitly absent.\n*   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂`: Incorrect hydrogen count and would imply a saturated alkyl chain instead of a propenyl group, contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a C₆H₄ group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed clues about the attached groups.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures with ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃).\n        *   The proton on the middle carbon is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The proton on the terminal carbon (attached to the ring) is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This confirms one of the substituents is a propenyl group (–C₃H₅), which also accounts for one of the two –CH₃ signals.\n    *   **Assembling the second substituent:** We still need to place the ester group (–COO–) and the second –CH₃ group. The only way to do this without creating a –CH₂– group is to form a methyl ester (–COOCH₃). This accounts for the second –CH₃ signal.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different groups, such as a propenyl group and a methyl ester group, would show distinct signals for the aromatic protons, consistent with the \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" description (likely an AA'BB' system if para-substituted).\n\n4.  **Construct the Molecule and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring: C₆H₄\n    *   We have a propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH₃ (which is C₃H₅)\n    *   We have a methyl ester group: –COOCH₃ (which is C₂H₃O₂)\n\n    Now, let's add up the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from ester)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃), which would introduce –CH₂– signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Adding another carbon or a carbon and two hydrogens without introducing a –CH₂– group and while keeping the other NMR-defined fragments is not feasible. For instance, adding a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring, particularly a para-substituted one where the two substituents are different.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** The absence of signals for –CH2 groups is a critical constraint, eliminating many possible structures.\n    *   **Two –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The signals for a doublet and a doublet of quartets are characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl hydrogen, resulting in a doublet. The second vinyl hydrogen is split by the first vinyl hydrogen (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), which results in a doublet of quartets. The methyl group of this substituent would appear as a doublet, accounting for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n    *   **The second –CH3 group:** This methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH2 groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl ester (–COOCH3). This accounts for the second –CH3 signal, which would appear as a singlet.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule consists of:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   A propenyl group (–CH=CHCH3).\n    *   A methyl ester group (–COOCH3).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the methyl ester group) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the benzene ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group: 1+1+3) + 3 (from the methyl ester group) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group).\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    This matches the structural features: 4 for the aromatic ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C double bond, and 1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n\nComparing this calculated formula to the given options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the functional groups and basic structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula C6H4. This structure accounts for 4 aromatic protons. The 1H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which is consistent with the 4 protons of a di-substituted ring (for example, a para-substituted ring often shows two doublets).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure -COO-. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O2) in the molecular formula.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate certain structural possibilities.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR signals in detail:**\n    *   **Two –CH3 signals:** Since there is an ester group and no –CH2 groups, one of the methyl groups must be part of a methyl ester (–COOCH3). An ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3) is ruled out because it contains a –CH2 group. The other –CH3 group must be part of the second substituent on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). The splitting pattern of a doublet (d) and a doublet of quartets (dq) is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (making it a quartet). Hence, a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a –CH=CH–CH3 group. This group also accounts for the second –CH3 signal, which would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structural fragments and determine the molecular formula:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Methyl ester group: –COOCH3\n    *   Propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH3\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O–CH3) + 3 (from –CH=CH–CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 3 (from O–CH3) + 5 (from –CH=CH–CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from –COO–) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\nThe derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A. All the spectroscopic data are consistent with a structure like methyl propenylbenzoate, which has this formula.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two aromatic-H signals:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) that is di-substituted has four protons remaining on the ring (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the protons on opposite sides of the ring are chemically equivalent, leading to two distinct signals, typically appearing as two doublets.\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) attached to another group with no protons (like the aromatic ring).\n    *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n*   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is from the propenyl (-CH=CH-**CH₃**) group identified above. The second methyl signal must come from the other substituent.\n*   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint that eliminates any structures containing a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Absorption peaks indicating an ester group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This group must also incorporate the second methyl group identified in the NMR. The two possibilities for an ester containing a methyl group but no methylene group are:\n    1.  A **methyl ester** group (-COOCH₃).\n    2.  An **acetate** group (-OCOCH₃).\n\n### 3. Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound consists of the following fragments:\n\n*   A **para-substituted benzene ring**: C₆H₄\n*   A **propenyl group**: -CH=CH-CH₃ (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n*   An **ester group containing one methyl group**: This can be either -COOCH₃ or -OCOCH₃, both of which have a formula of C₂H₃O₂.\n\nCombining these fragments gives the total molecular formula:\n\nC₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester part) = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n\nThis formula corresponds to structures like (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate. Both of these structures are consistent with all the provided spectral data and have the same molecular formula. A search in chemical databases confirms that the molecular formula for (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate is indeed C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** This formula would require an additional CH₂ group compared to the derived formula, which is contradicted by the NMR data.\n*   **B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula would require an additional carbon atom without additional hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the identified fragments.\n*   **C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** This formula perfectly matches the composition derived from the detailed analysis of the NMR and FTIR spectra.\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula has two extra hydrogens, which would imply the saturation of the propenyl double bond, but the NMR data clearly indicates the presence of vinyl protons.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to determine the molecular formula of an unknown compound from a list of choices, using its spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data - Piece by Piece:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells me the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two things attached to it. A benzene ring is C6H6. When it's di-substituted, two hydrogens are replaced, so the ring itself is a C6H4 fragment. The 1H NMR confirms this with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\", which is typical for a symmetrical di-substituted ring (like a para-substituted one), accounting for the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring.\n        *   Fragment 1: C6H4. (6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens).\n\n    *   **\"FTIR ... shows ... an ester group\"**: An ester functional group is R-COO-R'. This group contains one carbonyl carbon (C=O) and one ether-like oxygen.\n        *   Fragment 2: -COO- group. (1 Carbon, 2 Oxygens).\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. The splitting pattern is key.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) means that proton is being split by one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and by three other equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This is a classic pattern for a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` system. Specifically, the H attached to the carbon that's also attached to the CH3.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is a \"doublet\" (d), meaning it's only split by one other proton (the first vinyl proton).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This group has 2 vinyl protons and 3 methyl protons.\n        *   Fragment 3: -CH=CH-CH3. (3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens).\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We've already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. There must be a second one.\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR ... no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. Where does the second CH3 group belong? It must be part of the ester. For an ester (R-COO-R'), if we had an ethyl group (e.g., -COOCH2CH3), we would see a -CH2- signal. Since there isn't one, the alkyl part of the ester must be a methyl group (-CH3). So, the ester is a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`).\n        *   Fragment 4: The second -CH3 group, which is part of the ester. (1 Carbon, 3 Hydrogens).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Pieces and Calculate the Formula:** Now, I'll sum up all the atoms from the identified fragments.\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 1 (from -COO-) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's CH3 group) = 11 Carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's CH3 group) = 12 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the -COO- ester group).\n    *   **Total Formula:** C11H12O2.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n    *   My calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n5.  **Final Verification (Sanity Check):** Does the structure `propenyl-C6H4-COOCH3` fit all the data?\n    *   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n    *   Ester: Yes (-COOCH3).\n    *   Aromatic H: Yes (4H, 2 signals if para).\n    *   Vinyl H: Yes (2H, a `d` and a `dq`).\n    *   CH3 groups: Yes, two of them (one from propenyl, one from methyl ester).\n    *   No CH2 groups: Yes, there are none.\n    *   Total Signals: 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6 signals. This matches the data.\n    The logic holds up perfectly. The answer is C. Now, I will format this logic into the requested Python code block.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the chemical formula of a compound based on spectroscopic data.\n# I will break down the data to identify the structural fragments and then sum their atoms to get the molecular formula.\n\nprint(\"Let's determine the molecular formula step-by-step by analyzing the spectroscopic data.\")\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the core structure from the description.\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 1: Analyze the Aromatic Ring ---\")\nring_carbons = 6\nring_hydrogens = 4\nprint(f\"The compound is a 'di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring'.\")\nprint(f\"This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogens have been replaced by other groups.\")\nprint(f\"This core structure is C6H4, contributing {ring_carbons} carbons and {ring_hydrogens} hydrogens.\")\nprint(\"The 'two signals corresponding to aromatic-H' in the 1H NMR spectrum is consistent with the 4 hydrogens on this C6H4 ring.\")\n\n# Step 2: Identify the functional groups from FTIR and NMR.\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 2: Identify the Functional Groups ---\")\n# Ester group\nester_oxygens = 2\nester_carbonyl_carbons = 1\nprint(f\"The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-).

This means it is a benzene ring with two substituents (R1 and R2). The base formula for this core is C6H4.\n2.  **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group is present. This means the molecule contains a -COO- functional group.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. If they give only two signals, it implies symmetry. A 1,4- (para) substitution pattern results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to two signals (typically two doublets). This is the most likely substitution pattern.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with protons attached. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**. This proton is coupled to two different sets of protons: one single proton (causing the doublet split) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, causing the quartet split).\n        *   This specific pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the central carbon is split by the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons (dq), while the terminal vinyl proton is split only by the central vinyl proton (d). This substituent has the formula -C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl substituent identified above.\n        *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of any methylene (-CH2-) groups in the molecule. This means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), propyl ester, etc.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\n*   **Fragment 1 (Core):** A para-disubstituted benzene ring, **-C6H4-**.\n*   **Fragment 2 (Substituent 1):** A propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. Its formula is **-C3H5**.\n*   **Fragment 3 (Substituent 2):** An ester group that contains a methyl group but no methylene group. The two possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**.\n    *   An acetate group: **-O-CO-CH3**.\n    *   In either case, this fragment contributes two oxygen atoms, two carbon atoms, and three hydrogen atoms. The formula contribution is **-C2H3O2**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total molecular formula.**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to get the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the result with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).**\n\nThe DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Formula-based DoU:** For C11H12O2, DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n*   **Structure-based DoU:** The deduced structure has:\n    *   A benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   A vinyl C=C double bond = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An ester C=O double bond = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Total = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\nThe DoU from the formula matches the DoU from the structure, confirming the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (Incorrect, implies fewer double bonds/rings)\n*   B) C12H14O2 (Incorrect formula and would require a -CH2- group, which is absent)\n*   C) C12H12O2 (Incorrect, has a different C count and would require an additional degree of unsaturation)\n*   D) C11H12O2 (Correct)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data allows for the step-by-step deduction of the compound's structure and, consequently, its molecular formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR and FTIR Data to Identify Key Structural Fragments\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The problem states the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of two signals for aromatic protons (Aromatic-H) suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para-) substituted benzene ring. This accounts for a **C₆H₄** core.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This group contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows two vinyl protons with specific splitting patterns: one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq). This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon bonded to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first one, giving a doublet. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the second substituent.\n*   **Absence of -CH₂- Groups:** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for methylene (-CH₂-) groups. This is a critical constraint that eliminates possibilities like ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other alkyl chains containing a -CH₂- unit.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in the molecule. Based on our identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring = 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O) = 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C) = 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nThe code execution calculated the DBE for each of the possible formulas:\n*   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 6\n*   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 6\n*   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 7 (Incorrect)\n*   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 5 (Incorrect)\n\nThis calculation eliminates options C and D, leaving A and B as possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nLet's combine the pieces we've identified to construct the full molecule and find its formula:\n1.  **C₆H₄** (di-substituted benzene core)\n2.  **-CH=CH-CH₃** (propenyl group, one substituent)\n3.  An ester group and a methyl group must form the second substituent without creating any -CH₂- groups. The only way to do this is to form a methyl ester, **-COOCH₃**.\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these assembled parts:\n*   From C₆H₄: 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n*   From -CH=CH-CH₃: 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n*   From -COOCH₃: 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   Oxygens: 2\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula matches option B. It has the correct DBE of 6 and accounts for all the features observed in the spectra, including the crucial absence of -CH₂- groups. Option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) has the correct DBE but contains an extra CH₂ unit, which would produce a signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum, contradicting the given information.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n### Deciphering the Molecular Formula through Spectral Analysis\n\nBy meticulously analyzing the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data, the chemical formula for the unknown di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound can be determined.\n\n#### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Hydrogen Count from 1H NMR:** The spectrum provides crucial information for determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two signals in the aromatic region, characteristic of a di-substituted benzene ring, strongly suggest a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This accounts for 4 hydrogen atoms (4H).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** The presence of a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the two vinyl protons is a classic pattern for a prop-1-enyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This indicates there are 2 vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH3) groups. One of these belongs to the prop-1-enyl group, and the other must be part of another substituent. These two methyl groups account for a total of 6 hydrogen atoms (3H + 3H).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** The explicit absence of signals for methylene (-CH2) groups is a key constraint.\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** Summing these up (4 aromatic H + 2 vinyl H + 3 vinyl-methyl H + 3 other-methyl H) gives a total of 12 hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Options based on Hydrogen Count:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible.**\n    *   C) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\n    *   D) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible.**\n\n3.  **Determining the Carbon Count and Degree of Unsaturation:** To differentiate between the remaining possibilities (B and D), we can assemble the molecular structure from the spectral data and calculate its degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU is the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Structural Components:**\n        *   A di-substituted (para) benzene ring (C6H4). This has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing 4 to the DoU.\n        *   An ester group (-COO-), confirmed by FTIR. The C=O double bond adds 1 to the DoU.\n        *   A prop-1-enyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The C=C double bond adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation from Structure:** The total DoU is 4 (from the ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from C=C) = 6.\n\n4.  **Cross-checking with Formulas:** Now, we calculate the DoU for the remaining possible formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   **For C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This **matches** the DoU derived from the structure.\n    *   **For C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This **does not match** the DoU derived from the structure.\n\nThis inconsistency eliminates C12H12O2. The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided data is C11H12O2. Two plausible structures for C11H12O2 that fit the data are methyl p-(prop-1-enyl)benzoate and prop-1-enyl p-toluate, both of which have the same molecular formula.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe detailed analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum indicates the molecule contains exactly 12 hydrogen atoms. The structural features inferred from the spectra correspond to a degree of unsaturation of 6. Only the molecular formula C11H12O2 satisfies both of these conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n\n2.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, having the base formula C6H4. The fact that the 1H NMR spectrum shows only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester or a propyl group.\n    *   **Two –CH3 signals:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The splitting patterns provide the structure of this group. A doublet of quartets for one vinyl-H indicates it is coupled to another vinyl-H (creating the doublet) and a methyl group (creating the quartet). A doublet for the other vinyl-H indicates it is coupled to only the first vinyl-H. This pattern uniquely identifies a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** One substituent is the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which accounts for the vinyl signals and one of the -CH3 signals. The second substituent is an ester. To account for the second -CH3 signal without introducing any -CH2- groups, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula Calculation:** The identified structure is methyl p-propenylbenzoate. Let's calculate its molecular formula:\n    *   Aromatic ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n    *   Methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option C. Other isomers with the formula C11H12O2, such as ethyl cinnamate or cinnamyl acetate, can be ruled out because their NMR spectra would not match the given data (e.g., cinnamyl acetate has a -CH2- group and ethyl cinnamate has both a -CH2- group and a monosubstituted aromatic ring).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2. This is determined by systematically breaking down the information provided by the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core structure is therefore a C₆H₄ group.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring contains 4 aromatic protons. The presence of two distinct signals suggests a specific substitution pattern, such as para-substitution, which would give two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these ester-containing fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This confirms the absence of ethyl or other methylene-containing fragments.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula:\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, the total molecular formula can be calculated:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Ester/Methyl Group:** C₂H₃O₂\n\nSumming the atoms from each fragment:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThus, the final chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches possible structures like methyl 4-propenylbenzoate or 4-propenylphenyl acetate, both of which are consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR spectrum:** Provides detailed information about the hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule.\n        *   \"six signals\": This means there are six chemically distinct types of protons.\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\": A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. Having two signals for these 4 protons is characteristic of a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern, which would show two doublets. Total aromatic protons = 4H.\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\": This is a classic pattern for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n            *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). The combined splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This fragment contains two vinyl protons (2H) and a methyl group (3H).\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\": We have already identified one methyl group from the propenyl fragment. The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. For it to be a simple methyl group signal and for the compound to have no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities add a methyl group (3H).\n        *   \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\": This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Determine the total number of hydrogen atoms:**\n    Based on the 1H NMR data, we can sum the number of protons:\n    *   Aromatic protons: 4H\n    *   Vinyl protons: 2H\n    *   Methyl protons: There are two distinct methyl groups, so 2 * 3H = 6H.\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12H.**\n\n    This allows us to eliminate options with a different number of hydrogens.\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (14H) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (12H) - Possible.\n    *   C) C12H12O2 (12H) - Possible.\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (14H) - Incorrect.\n\n3.  **Determine the total number of carbon and oxygen atoms:**\n    Now we assemble the molecular fragments identified from the spectra and count the atoms to distinguish between the remaining options (B and C).\n    *   **Aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl group:** -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Ester group part:** This part must contain the second methyl group.\n        *   Possibility 1: A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This fragment contains C2H3O2.\n        *   Possibility 2: An acetate group, `-OCOCH3`. This fragment also contains C2H3O2.\n    *   **Assembling the full molecule:** The structure consists of the C6H4 ring substituted with the propenyl group (C3H5) and the ester part (C2H3O2).\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms** = 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen atoms** = **2 oxygens** (from the ester group).\n\n4.  **Conclude the molecular formula:**\n    Based on the atom count, the molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    This matches option B and eliminates option C (C12H12O2).\n\n5.  **Final Verification (Degree of Unsaturation):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a useful check.\n    *   **DoU from formula (C11H12O2):** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   **DoU from structure:** The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DoU = 4), one C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and one C=O double bond (DoU = 1). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming the consistency of the derived structure and formula.\n\nAll evidence points to the molecular formula being C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group\". An ester has the functional group -COO-. This adds at least one carbon and two oxygen atoms to the formula.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum gives crucial information about the types of protons and their arrangement.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C carbons, H hydrogens, and O oxygens is:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n    Let's calculate the DBE for the structural features we know:\n    *   Aromatic ring: 1 ring and 3 double bonds = 4 DBE.\n    *   Ester group (-COO-): Contains one C=O double bond = 1 DBE.\n    *   Vinyl-H signals: This indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) = 1 DBE.\n\n    The total DBE required by the described structure is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given options:\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (Possible)\n    *   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (Possible)\n\n    Based on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options A and B. We are left with C and D.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data in Detail:**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring gives two signals for its 4 aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first one, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment has the formula -C₃H₅.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\"**: One methyl group (-CH₃) comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must be located elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**: This is a critical piece of information. It rules out any ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or similar alkyl chains.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   One substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), which provides the vinyl signals and one of the methyl signals. This fragment is -C₃H₅.\n    *   The other substituent must be the ester group and contain the second methyl group, with no -CH₂- groups. The two simplest possibilities for the ester part are:\n        1.  A methyl ester group: -COOCH₃.\n        2.  An acetate group: -O-CO-CH₃.\n    *   Let's test these possibilities by calculating the total formula:\n        *   **Structure 1 (Methyl Ester):** The substituents are -CH=CH-CH₃ and -COOCH₃.\n            *   Formula = C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + CH₃ (from ester) + CO₂ (ester carbonyls) = C(6+3+1)H(4+5+3)O₂ = **C₁₀H₁₂O₂**.

The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** fragment.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an \"ester group.\" An ester has the general formula R-COO-R' and contributes two oxygen atoms (**O2**) to the molecular formula.\n    *   **1H NMR (Vinyl-H):** The spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals with specific splitting patterns: \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets.\" This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This substituent has a formula of **C3H5**.\n    *   **1H NMR (-CH3):** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups.\"\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group we just identified.\n        *   The other methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n    *   **1H NMR (No -CH2-):** The information that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\" is critical. It means that the ester cannot be, for instance, an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), because that would contain a -CH2- group. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, making it either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OCOCH3)**. In either case, this entire fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the total formula (C+H3 from the methyl part, and C+O2 from the ester core).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Total Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** C3H5\n    *   **Ester-Methyl Group:** C2H3O2\n\n    Let's add them together:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** This formula matches our detailed analysis.\n    *   B) C11H14O2: Incorrect number of hydrogens.\n    *   C) C12H12O2: Incorrect number of carbons.\n    *   D) C12H14O2: Incorrect number of carbons and hydrogens.

This fragment is `-C6H4-`.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is only split by the first one, giving a doublet (d).\n    *   **Two –CH3 group signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information. It eliminates possibilities like ethyl esters (`-COOCH2CH3`) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   The spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (`-COO-`). Combined with the NMR data, this ester group must involve the second methyl group, suggesting either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-O-CO-CH3`) functionality.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A para-phenylene group: `-C6H4-`\n    *   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group: Either `-COOCH3` or `-O-CO-CH3`\n\n    Let's assemble these on the para-substituted benzene ring. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate:\n    `CH3-CH=CH-` (propenyl) attached to a `C6H4` ring, which is also attached to `-COOCH3` (methyl ester).\n\n4.  **Determine the Chemical Formula from the Deduced Structure:**\n    Let's count the atoms in the proposed structure (methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate):\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from -OCH3) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 5 (from propenyl) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from -OCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE confirms the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   From the structure: 1 (ring) + 3 (pi bonds in ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = **DBE of 6**.\n    *   From the options:\n        *   A) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n        *   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6  **(Matches)**\n        *   C) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    Both B and D have the correct DBE. However, to get from C11H12O2 (our deduced structure) to C12H14O2, one would need to add a `CH2` group. The problem statement explicitly says there are **no signals for –CH2 groups**, which rules out option D.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. A benzene ring itself has a DBE of 4 (one ring and three double bonds). The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group (-COO-), which contains a C=O double bond, adding 1 to the DBE. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two signals for vinyl-H, indicating the presence of a C=C double bond, which adds another 1 to the DBE.\n    *   Total DBE = 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DBE for each possible formula:** The formula for DBE is `C - H/2 + 1` (ignoring the oxygen atoms as they don't affect the calculation).\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n    *   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. This matches the required DBE.\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. This matches the required DBE.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n\n    Based on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options A and D. We are left with C11H14O2 and C11H12O2. Let's recheck the calculation for B. C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. So B and C are possible based on DBE alone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals for aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with a para (1,4) substitution pattern would give two distinct signals due to symmetry. This accounts for `C6H4`.\n    *   **Vinyl Region:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The hydrogen on the carbon next to the ring would be split by the other vinyl hydrogen (doublet). The other vinyl hydrogen would be split by the first vinyl hydrogen (doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment accounts for `C3H5` (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** There are two signals for -CH3 groups. One of these is accounted for by the propenyl group. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since the compound has no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`). Both of these contain a methyl group.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2-:** The explicit mention of no signals for -CH2- groups is a crucial clue.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`.\n    *   We have a propenyl substituent: `-C3H5`.\n    *   We have an ester that includes a methyl group. Let's assume a methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`. This accounts for `C2H3O2`.\n\n    Let's assemble these pieces into a final structure: `methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate`.\n    The total formula is the sum of the parts: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + COOCH3 (methyl ester group).\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (methyl ester) = 11 Carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl ester) = 12 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (ester) = 2 Oxygens.\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Check:**\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n    *   The DBE for C11H12O2 is 6, which is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   The structure derived from the NMR data has no -CH2- groups.\n    *   Let's consider option B (C12H14O2). To get from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2, we would need to add a `CH2` group. However, the problem states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, which makes C12H14O2 impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the given spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we can systematically analyze the provided spectral data to determine its constituent fragments.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Structure and FTIR:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means it has a `C6H4` core. The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (`-COO-`).\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of two signals for these 4 protons is characteristic of a para (1,4) substituted ring, which would show two doublets due to symmetry. This confirms the `C6H4` fragment. (Total protons so far: 4)\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (2 signals):** There are two signals for vinyl protons (hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond). The splitting patterns—one doublet and one doublet of quartets—are a classic indicator of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, while the other vinyl proton appears as a doublet. This fragment is `-C₃H₅`. (Total protons so far: 4 + 2 = 6)\n    *   **Methyl Protons (2 signals):** The spectrum shows two signals for methyl (`-CH₃`) groups.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH₃`) fragment identified above.\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since the data indicates no `-CH₂` groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these fragments contribute one methyl group and have the formula `-C₂H₃O₂`. (Total protons so far: 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 12)\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This crucial piece of information rules out fragments like ethyl groups, confirming the assignment of the ester as a methyl ester or acetate.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we combine the atoms from each identified fragment to determine the total molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** `C₆H₄`\n*   **Propenyl Group:** `C₃H₅` (This includes one vinyl -CH=CH- and one -CH₃)\n*   **Ester Fragment:** `C₂H₃O₂` (This includes the -COO- and the second -CH₃)\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds within the ring, one vinyl double bond, and one carbonyl double bond), which is consistent with the proposed structure.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n*   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe deduced formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core formula for this part of the molecule is C6H4.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Functional Groups:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an **ester group** (-COO-). This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows signals for vinyl protons, which indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) outside the aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2 signals):** This is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond) that are coupled to each other is indicated.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**, which means it is split by only one neighboring proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**. This complex splitting pattern is very informative. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton. The \"quartet\" part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The vinyl proton splitting pattern (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) strongly indicates a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** is one of the substituents. This fragment contains one of the two methyl groups.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (2 signals):** The compound has two distinct methyl (-CH3) groups. One is part of the propenyl group just identified. The other must be part of the second substituent.\n    *   **No Methylene Protons (no -CH2- signals):** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 aromatic ring.\n    *   Substituent 1 is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   Substituent 2 must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3), with no methylene (-CH2-) groups. The most logical structure for this is a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This group has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11 carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12 hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This molecular formula is consistent with all the provided spectral data. For instance, a compound like methyl 4-propenylbenzoate would fit this description.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The aromatic part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR data:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** This is the most informative part for determining the substituents.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. Whatever the substituents are, they cannot contain a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a double bond with a proton on each carbon (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Vinyl-H splitting:** One vinyl-H is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   Let's label the protons: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b), so it appears as a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three H(c) protons (a quartet). Thus, H(b) appears as a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms one substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This group adds **C3H5** to the formula and contains no -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these -CH3 groups is the one in the propenyl substituent. Its protons (c) are split by H(b), so they would appear as a doublet. This accounts for one -CH3 signal.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the other substituent, which also contains the ester group.\n    *   **The second substituent:** We need to form an ester group that includes a -CH3 group but has no -CH2- group. There are two possibilities:\n        *   An **acetoxy group**: -O-CO-CH3.\n        *   A **carbomethoxy group**: -CO-O-CH3.\n        *   Both of these groups fit the criteria: they are esters, contain a methyl (-CH3) group (which would appear as a singlet in the NMR spectrum), and have no methylene (-CH2-) groups. Both of these groups add **C2H3O2** to the formula.\n\n4.  **Assemble the final formula:** Now, we combine the parts we have identified:\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): C2H3O2\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2\n\nThe final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Match with the options:**\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C12H12O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure Skeleton:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C₆H₄.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:** The IR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two signals for aromatic protons. For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other side, resulting in just two distinct signals (often two doublets).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two signals for vinyl protons.\n        *   One is a **doublet**, meaning it is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**, meaning it is coupled to two different sets of protons: one proton (causing the doublet split) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH₃ group, causing the quartet split).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula -C₃H₅.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One -CH₃ group is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The second -CH₃ signal, combined with the fact that there is an ester and no -CH₂ groups, strongly points to a **methyl ester** (-COOCH₃). This accounts for the ester group from the IR and the second methyl group. The formula for this substituent is -CO₂CH₃, which is C₂H₃O₂.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂):** The spectrum explicitly shows **no signals** for -CH₂ groups. This is a critical constraint, ruling out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure:\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **-C₃H₅**\n*   A methyl ester group: **-C₂H₃O₂**\n\n### Calculating the Molecular Formula:\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from each fragment to determine the total molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from methyl ester)\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A search confirms that a potential structure fitting this data, (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, has this exact molecular formula.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nComparing our calculated formula with the given options:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:** I'll break down the spectroscopic data to identify the structural fragments of the molecule.\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells me the core structure is a benzene ring (C6) with two other groups attached.\n    *   **FTIR: Ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This means the molecular formula must contain two oxygen atoms, which all the options do.\n    *   **1H NMR Signal Analysis:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** On a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four ring protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is C6H4.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and one -CH3 signal:** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`. The H next to the ring is split by the other vinyl H and the methyl group (doublet of quartets), and the terminal vinyl H is split only by the other vinyl H (doublet). This fragment consists of C3H5.\n        *   **A second -CH3 signal:** We've already accounted for one methyl group in the propenyl fragment. The ester group is `R-COO-R'`. The second methyl group signal, combined with the fact that there are *no* `-CH2-` signals, points to the `R'` part of the ester being a simple methyl group. Thus, we have a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`. This fragment adds C1, H3, and O2 to the part of the ester that is not the methyl group itself.\n        *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that confirms the methyl ester idea. If it were an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, we would see a -CH2- signal.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:** Now, I will put all the identified pieces together and sum up the atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** `C6H4`\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl group):** `-CH=CH-CH3` which is `C3H5`\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Methyl ester group):** `-COOCH3` which is `C2H3O2`\n\n    Let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester)\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) C11H12O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n\n    My calculated formula, C11H12O2, perfectly matches option A.\n\n4.  **Final Code Generation:** I will write a Python script that programmatically represents this deduction process. The code will define the atoms in each fragment and sum them to determine the final formula, then select the correct option.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n2.  **FTIR Data:** There is an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms, and it also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n3.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **6 total signals:** This indicates there are 6 types of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents in the *para* (1,4) positions would typically show two signals (often two doublets). This is the most likely substitution pattern. This C6H4 group accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group.\n        *   The hydrogen on the carbon next to the CH3 group would be split by the adjacent vinyl hydrogen (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl hydrogen would be split only by its neighboring vinyl hydrogen, giving a doublet (d).\n        *   This propenyl group fragment is C3H5.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified.\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent.\n    *   **No -CH2- signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the molecular fragments.**\n\nWe have the following pieces to build our molecule:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring core (C6H4).\n*   An ester functional group (-COO-).\n*   A propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   A methyl group (-CH3) that is not part of the propenyl group.\n*   The constraint of no -CH2- groups.\n\nLet's assemble the two substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Substituent 1:** This is the propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n*   **Substituent 2:** This must contain the ester group and the second methyl group. To incorporate the -CH3 and -COO- fragments without creating a -CH2- group, there are two possibilities for how it attaches to the aromatic ring:\n    1.  A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n    2.  An acetate group: -OCOCH3\n\nBoth potential substituents, -COOCH3 and -OCOCH3, fulfill the conditions: they contain an ester, a methyl group, and no methylene group. Therefore, the overall structure is a benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group and either a -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3 group. A likely structure is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate or Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. Both of these structures fit all the spectral data provided.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total chemical formula.**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from the identified parts to find the molecular formula. The formula will be the same regardless of which of the two possible ester arrangements is correct.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n*   **Substituent 1 (propenyl group):** C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n*   **Substituent 2 (ester part):** This will be either -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3. In both cases, the fragment consists of C2H3O2.\n\nLet's add them up:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\n*   A) C12H12O2\n*   B) C11H14O2\n*   C) C12H14O2\n*   D) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points & Final Check:**\n\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** A good way to verify the result.\n    *   Formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Structure: Benzene ring (4 DoU) + one C=C double bond (1 DoU) + one C=O double bond (1 DoU) = 6 DoU. The DoU values match, confirming our structural analysis is consistent with the formula.\n*   **Ruled-out options:** The other options can be ruled out. C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 have too many hydrogens and would require -CH2- groups, which are explicitly stated to be absent. C12H12O2 has an extra degree of unsaturation that cannot be explained by the given NMR fragments.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the chemical formula of an unknown compound by interpreting its spectroscopic data. Here's a systematic breakdown of the information provided:\n\n1.  **Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents, giving a core structure of `C6H4`. The benzene ring itself accounts for 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which corresponds to 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This group contains a carbonyl bond (`C=O`), which adds 1 more degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectral Data:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two sets of aromatic protons is most commonly a 1,4-para substituted ring.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets):** This is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The double bond (`C=C`) in this group adds another degree of unsaturation. The fragment formula is `C3H5`.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One methyl group belongs to the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other methyl group must be part of the second substituent, the one containing the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial piece of information. The second substituent, which contains the ester group (`-COO-`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`), cannot contain any methylene (`-CH2-`) units. The only way to combine these pieces without a `-CH2-` is to form either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester attached through the oxygen (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, the fragment formula is `C2H3O2`.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n    *   Aromatic core: `C6H4`\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): `C3H5`\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester + methyl): `C2H3O2`\n\n    Adding these together:\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen:** 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU calculated from the proposed structure is: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the candidate formula `C11H12O2`: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU values match, confirming the consistency of our derived structure with the formula.\n\n    As confirmed by the code execution output, other formulas are inconsistent. C11H14O2 and C12H12O2 have the wrong DoU. C12H14O2 has the correct DoU but would require an additional `CH2` group compared to our structure, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on the information provided, we can deduce the structure and formula of the unknown compound step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The ¹H NMR shows two signals for aromatic hydrogens, which typically indicates a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern on a benzene ring. This accounts for a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This means the molecule contains two oxygen atoms, accounting for the **O₂** in the formula.\n\n3.  **Vinyl and Methyl Groups (¹H NMR):**\n    *   There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The other vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group. This fragment accounts for **C₃H₅** and one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   There is a second methyl group signal (-CH₃). Since the spectrum has no signals for methylene (-CH₂-) groups, this methyl group must be part of the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). This accounts for a **-CH₃** fragment.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nNow, we assemble these fragments to form a complete molecule that is a di-substituted aromatic ester. There are two primary possibilities that fit all the data:\n\n*   **Possibility 1: Methyl 4-propenylbenzoate**\n    *   Fragments: A 4-propenyl group (-C₃H₅) and a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) are attached to the benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   Formula Calculation: C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: 4-propenylphenyl acetate**\n    *   Fragments: A 4-propenyl group (-C₃H₅) and an acetate group (-O-CO-CH₃) are attached to the benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   Formula Calculation: C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nBoth plausible structures consistent with all the given spectral information have the same molecular formula: C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Evaluating Other Options\n\n*   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** These formulas contain more hydrogen atoms, indicating fewer double bonds or rings (a lower degree of unsaturation). The presence of both an aromatic ring and a vinyl group is confirmed by the NMR, which contradicts the degree of unsaturation calculated for C₁₁H₁₄O₂. Constructing a molecule for C₁₂H₁₄O₂ that fits all NMR criteria (especially the \"no -CH₂ groups\" rule) is not feasible.\n*   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula has a higher degree of unsaturation than C₁₁H₁₂O₂, implying an additional ring or double bond, which is not supported by the provided NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that logically fits the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄). The presence of a benzene ring corresponds to four degrees of unsaturation.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond adds one degree of unsaturation.\n3.  **¹H NMR Data Breakdown:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents in a 1,4 (para) arrangement would typically show two signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split into a doublet by its vinyl neighbor. The other vinyl proton is split by its vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group accounts for `C₃H₅`.\n    *   **Two -CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is from the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH₃`). The second methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`). A methyl ester group is consistent with the FTIR data and introduces another `-CH₃` group. The chemical shift for a methyl ester is typically around 3.7-4.1 ppm.\n    *   **No -CH₂ signals:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence, ruling out structures containing ethyl groups, propyl groups, or other moieties with methylene (`-CH₂`) protons.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n*   A propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH₃` (C₃H₅).\n*   A methyl ester group, `-COOCH₃` (C₂H₃O₂).\n\nThe most likely structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the assembled parts:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from benzene) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from benzene) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A search confirms that the common name for this compound is (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and its molecular formula is indeed C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n### Evaluating the Options Using Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (ignoring halogens and including oxygen as neutral).\n\nThe proposed structure has a benzene ring (4 DoU), a C=C bond (1 DoU), and a C=O bond (1 DoU), for a total of **6 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's check the DoU for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This is incorrect. Furthermore, to have 14 hydrogens, the propenyl group would need to be saturated to a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), which would introduce two `-CH₂` signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n*   **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. While the DoU matches, getting to C₁₂ and H₁₄ from the correct C₁₁H₁₂ structure would require adding a `-CH₂` group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**. This matches the expected DoU and all the spectral data align perfectly with a structure corresponding to this formula.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This corresponds to a C₆H₄- group.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (CO₂). The carbonyl (C=O) in the ester is a source of one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Six signals in total.\n        *   Two aromatic-H signals suggest a substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This pattern is characteristic of a -CH=CH-CH₃ group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment accounts for C₃H₅ and provides one of the two -CH₃ signals.\n        *   Two separate signals for -CH₃ groups. We've identified one in the -CH=CH-CH₃ group. The other must come from the second substituent.\n        *   **No signals for -CH₂ groups.** This is a critical piece of information for eliminating incorrect structures.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The information from the spectra indicates the presence of:\n    *   A benzene ring (4 DoU)\n    *   A carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl group, 1 DoU)\n    *   A carbon-oxygen double bond (ester group, 1 DoU)\n    The total degrees of unsaturation for the molecule must be 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n3.  **Check the DoU for each possible formula:**\n    The formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For a CₓHᵧO₂ compound, this simplifies to DoU = (2x + 2 - y) / 2.\n    *   A) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = (2*11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6. This matches our calculated DoU.\n    *   B) **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = (2*11 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5. This does not match.\n    *   C) **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = (2*12 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7. This does not match.\n    *   D) **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = (2*12 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6. This also matches our calculated DoU.\n\n4.  **Differentiate between C₁₁H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:**\n    We must use the remaining NMR information, specifically the absence of a -CH₂- signal, to distinguish between the two possibilities.\n\n    *   **For C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (Option A):**\n        Let's assemble the fragments we've identified:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n        *   Propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃ (C₃H₅)\n        *   Ester group and the second methyl group. The remaining atoms are C₁₁H₁₂O₂ - C₆H₄ - C₃H₅ = C₂H₃O₂.\n        *   The fragment C₂H₃O₂ perfectly corresponds to an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). This provides the ester function and the second -CH₃ signal.\n        *   A plausible structure would be **propenylphenyl acetate**. This molecule contains a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and importantly, **no -CH₂- groups**. Thus, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is a valid candidate.\n\n    *   **For C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D):**\n        Let's assemble the fragments for this formula:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n        *   Propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH₃ (C₃H₅)\n        *   Ester group and the second methyl group. The remaining atoms are C₁₂H₁₄O₂ - C₆H₄ - C₃H₅ = C₃H₅O₂.\n        *   We need to form a substituent from C₃H₅O₂ that contains an ester and a methyl group. A plausible candidate is an ethyl ester group, **-COO-CH₂-CH₃**. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅O₂.\n        *   However, the ethyl ester group contains a **-CH₂- group**. The NMR data explicitly states there are no signals for -CH₂- groups. Any other arrangement of C₃H₅O₂ to form an ester substituent (like a propanoate group, -O-CO-CH₂-CH₃) would also contain a -CH₂- group.\n        *   Therefore, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ is not a valid candidate as any structure consistent with the other data would have to contain a -CH₂- group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectral data, particularly the degrees of unsaturation and the absence of any -CH₂- signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum, the only possible chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds. We can deduce the required DoU from the structural information provided:\n    *   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, so its DoU is 4.\n    *   An ester group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, contributing 1 to the DoU.\n    *   The NMR spectrum shows two vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a C=C double bond, which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for each formula option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`, where C, H, and N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. For a formula CₓHᵧO₂, this simplifies to `DoU = x - y/2 + 1`. The python script has already performed this calculation:\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = **6**\n\n    Based on the DoU calculation, we can eliminate options B and C, as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. We are left with options A (C11H12O2) and D (C12H14O2).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure from NMR Data:** Now we use the detailed ¹H NMR information to build the molecule's fragments and determine the atom count.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The spectrum shows two signals for aromatic protons. This is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring, which has the formula **-C₆H₄-**.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The presence of two vinyl proton signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) along with one of the methyl signals strongly suggests a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Ester and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester group (-COO-). The NMR shows a second -CH₃ signal and importantly, **no -CH₂- signals**. This means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or anything larger. It must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **-C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n4.  **Sum the Atoms of the Fragments:** Let's add up the atoms from the fragments we identified:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The assembled structure directly from the spectroscopic evidence gives a chemical formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This matches option A. A structure corresponding to C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option D) would require an additional -CH₂- unit, which would produce a -CH₂- signal in the NMR spectrum, contradicting the given information.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **Compound Type:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** \"absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\" confirms the presence of a –COO– functional group.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Aromatic Region:** \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is a strong indicator of a *para*-substitution pattern (1,4-disubstituted) on the benzene ring. An unsymmetrical ortho or meta substitution would give four signals. A symmetrical para substitution gives two signals. This means we have 4 aromatic protons in total, divided into two chemically different sets.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Vinyl Region:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. The splitting pattern described (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a propenyl group, specifically **–CH=CH–CH₃**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃`.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the three protons of the CH₃ group into a quartet. This results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   Proton H(a) is only split by H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This fragment accounts for two vinyl proton signals and one of the methyl group signals.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Alkyl Region:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\". One of these methyl signals belongs to the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃) identified above. The second methyl signal must belong to the only other part of the molecule we know: the ester group. For an ester to contain a methyl group and no CH₂ groups, it must be either a methyl ester (**–COOCH₃**) or an acetate ester (**–OOCCH₃**).\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum - Key Constraint:** \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\" This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n    Based on the analysis, we can assemble the pieces:\n    *   A *para*-substituted benzene ring: **p-C₆H₄**\n    *   A propenyl group: **–CH=CH–CH₃**\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group: either **–COOCH₃** or **–OOCCH₃**\n\n    Let's combine these fragments. The two possible structures are:\n    *   **Structure I:** Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate\n    *   **Structure II:** 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate\n\n    Both structures perfectly fit all the given spectroscopic data (para-disubstituted ring, ester, propenyl group signals, two distinct methyl signals, and no CH₂ signals).\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n\n    Now, we calculate the molecular formula for the structure we've deduced. Since both possible structures are isomers, they will have the same formula.\n\n    Let's count the atoms in Structure I (Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate):\n    *   **Benzene ring (C₆H₄):** 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   **Propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃):** 3 Carbons, (1+1+3) = 5 Hydrogens\n    *   **Methyl ester group (–COOCH₃):** (1+1) = 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total:**\n        *   Carbons (C) = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n        *   Hydrogens (H) = 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n        *   Oxygens (O) = **2**\n\n    The chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify Against the Options:**\n\n    The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches one of the given options. Let's briefly check why the others are incorrect.\n\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (DBE=6):** This is our derived formula. The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is 6 (4 for the ring, 1 for C=C, 1 for C=O), which matches the structure.\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DBE=5):** Has two more hydrogens than our structure. Adding two hydrogens would require removing a double bond. Saturating the propenyl's C=C bond would create a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃), which introduces forbidden –CH₂– signals.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DBE=7):** Has an extra C and an extra degree of unsaturation. It's not possible to add a carbon and a double bond/ring to our structure without violating the NMR constraints (e.g., creating a tri-substituted ring or adding more vinyl signals).\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DBE=6):** Has the same DBE as our structure but contains an additional C and 2H (a CH₂ unit). Adding a CH₂ unit is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. For example, changing the methyl ester to an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃) would yield this formula but would also show a –CH₂– signal.\n\n    Therefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structural Core and Functional Groups**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the base of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The ring itself contributes a **C6H4** fragment to the molecule.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group**: An ester functional group (R-COO-R') contains two oxygen atoms. This means the molecular formula will end in **O2**. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this finding.\n\n**2. Decode the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify the Substituents**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We will identify the two substituents attached to the C6H4 ring.\n\n*   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H**: A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. The fact that these four protons give only two signals indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a 1,4- (or para-) substitution.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)**: This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n    *   Let's visualize this fragment attached to the ring: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The proton H(b) is split by the adjacent H(a) into a doublet, and it is also split by the three protons of the -CH3 group into a quartet. This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   The proton H(a) is only split by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This confirms one substituent is a propenyl group. Let's count its atoms: **C3H5**.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups**: The molecule has two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n    *   We have already identified one as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n    *   The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent.\n*   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**: This is a crucial piece of negative information. The second substituent contains the ester group and a methyl group but **cannot** contain a methylene (-CH2-) unit. The only simple way to construct this is as a **methyl ester group (-COOCH3)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), for example, is ruled out because it contains a -CH2- group. The formula for the methyl ester fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Final Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n\n*   Aromatic Ring: **C6H4**\n*   Substituent 1 (Propenyl group): **C3H5**\n*   Substituent 2 (Methyl ester group): **C2H3O2**\n\nLet's calculate the total:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe final molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option B.\n\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An absorption peak for an ester group (–COO–) is present. An ester group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). Having only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a para (1,4) substitution. This would give two sets of two equivalent protons.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This specific splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n            *   Let's label the group as `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to the adjacent proton H(b), so its signal is a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` substituent. This group also provides one of the two methyl signals.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one methyl group from the propenyl substituent. The second methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out many common alkyl groups like ethyl (–CH2CH3) or propyl (–CH2CH2CH3). For the ester group, it rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3).\n\n2.  **Piece together the molecular structure:**\n    *   **Core:** A para-substituted benzene ring (p-C6H4).\n    *   **Substituent 1:** A propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group and no methylene (–CH2–) group. The two possibilities are:\n        *   A methyl ester group: –COOCH3\n        *   An acetoxy group: –O–CO–CH3\n    *   Both possibilities fit the given data. Let's build a potential structure: methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. The other possibility is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Determine the chemical formula from the deduced structure:**\n    Let's sum the atoms for the identified fragments:\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group substituent: C3H5\n    *   Ester substituent (either –COOCH3 or –OOCCH3): C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Formula:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O(2) = **C11H12O2**\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **From the structure:** 1 aromatic ring (DBE=4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (DBE=1) + 1 ester C=O bond (DBE=1) = **Total DBE = 6**.\n    *   **From the formula C11H12O2:** Using the formula DBE = C + 1 - (H/2), we get DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    The DBE from the structure and the formula match, confirming our deduction.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    Let's calculate the DBE for each option to see which ones are plausible. The correct formula must have a DBE of 6.\n    \n    ```python\n    def calculate_dbe(C, H):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the degrees of unsaturation.\"\"\"\n        return C - H/2 + 1\n\n    # DBE for the proposed structure is 6 (ring=4, C=C=1, C=O=1)\n    print(f\"The DBE required by the spectral data is 6.\")\n\n    # Option A: C11H14O2\n    dbe_A = calculate_dbe(11, 14)\n    print(f\"Option A (C11H14O2) has DBE = {dbe_A}\")\n\n    # Option B: C12H12O2\n    dbe_B = calculate_dbe(12, 12)\n    print(f\"Option B (C12H12O2) has DBE = {dbe_B}\")\n\n    # Option C: C12H14O2\n    dbe_C = calculate_dbe(12, 14)\n    print(f\"Option C (C12H14O2) has DBE = {dbe_C}\")\n\n    # Option D: C11H12O2\n    dbe_D = calculate_dbe(11, 12)\n    print(f\"Option D (C11H12O2) has DBE = {dbe_D}\")\n    ```\n\n    *   The DBE for C11H14O2 is 5. This is incorrect.\n    *   The DBE for C12H12O2 is 7. This is incorrect.\n    *   The DBE for C12H14O2 is 6. This is plausible based on DBE alone.\n    *   The DBE for C11H12O2 is 6. This is plausible based on DBE alone.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    We must choose between C11H12O2 (Option D) and C12H14O2 (Option C). Our detailed structural analysis based on the NMR splitting patterns led directly to the formula C11H12O2. It is not possible to construct a C12H14O2 molecule that fits all the specific constraints (especially the propenyl splitting pattern and the absence of –CH2– signals). Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides the most direct clues to the number and types of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, which is essential for determining the chemical formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** The spectrum shows two signals corresponding to aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) has four hydrogen atoms attached to it (C₆H₄). The presence of only two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para) substitution.\n    *   Number of aromatic hydrogens = 4\n\n*   **Vinyl Hydrogens:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens (-CH=CH-). The splitting patterns (a doublet and a doublet of quartets) are characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), where the two vinyl protons split each other, and one is further split by the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   Number of vinyl hydrogens = 2\n\n*   **Methyl Hydrogens (-CH₃):** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl groups. One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**) identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   Number of hydrogens in two -CH₃ groups = 2 × 3 = 6\n\n*   **Methylene Hydrogens (-CH₂):** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH₂ groups.\n    *   Number of methylene hydrogens = 0\n\n### 2. Calculating the Total Number of Hydrogens\n\nBy summing the hydrogens from each part of the molecule identified by the ¹H NMR spectrum, we can find the total number of hydrogens in the molecular formula.\n\n*   Total Hydrogens = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H)\n*   Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = **12**\n\nThis calculation immediately eliminates options C (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and D (C₁₁H₁₄O₂), as they both contain 14 hydrogen atoms. The correct formula must be either C₁₁H₁₂O₂ or C₁₂H₁₂O₂.\n\n### 3. Assembling the Molecular Structure to Count Carbons\n\nNow, let's determine the number of carbon atoms by piecing together the structural fragments.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** A benzene ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group (-COO-), which contains 1 carbon atom.\n*   **Molecular Skeleton from ¹H NMR:**\n    *   The two vinyl hydrogens belong to two carbon atoms (-**C**H=**C**H-).\n    *   The two methyl groups contribute two more carbon atoms (2 × -**C**H₃).\n\nLet's sum the carbon atoms from these identified fragments:\n\n*   Total Carbons = (Aromatic Ring C) + (Ester C) + (Vinyl C) + (Methyl C)\n*   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **11**\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to a molecule containing 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms (from the ester group).\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 11\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 12\n*   **Oxygen atoms:** 2\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis corresponds to structures like *methyl p-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate* or *p-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate*, both of which fit all the spectral data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Components from the Spectra:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of only two signals for aromatic hydrogens in the ¹H NMR spectrum strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two sets, leading to two distinct signals (often appearing as doublets). This aromatic core corresponds to a C₆H₄ unit.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-), which contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O bond. This group adds one carbon and two oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   **Vinyl and Methyl Groups:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split into a quartet by the -CH₃ and into a doublet by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, appearing as a doublet. This fragment accounts for one vinyl C=C bond, two vinyl hydrogens, and one of the two methyl groups mentioned. This propenyl group has a formula of -C₃H₅.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group:** The spectrum shows a second signal for a –CH₃ group. Since there are no –CH₂ signals, this methyl group cannot be part of a larger alkyl chain like an ethyl group. Given the presence of an ester, this second methyl is most likely part of a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). In either case, it's a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **No Methylene Groups:** The explicit absence of –CH₂ signals is crucial, as it rules out isomers containing ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains with methylene units. For example, ethyl cinnamate (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) is an isomer but would show -CH₂ signals.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon atoms:** 6 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 1 (from the -COO- ester carbonyl) + 3 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 1 (from the second CH₃ group) = 11 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the -C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from the second -CH₃ group) = 12 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from the -COO- ester group).\n\n    Combining these parts gives a molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A potential structure fitting this data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n3.  **Verify with Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula would have fewer double bonds or rings than indicated by the NMR (vinyl protons require a C=C bond in addition to the aromatic ring). This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** These formulas contain an additional carbon atom. To accommodate this and the NMR data, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ would need a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly ruled out. C₁₂H₁₂O₂ would require an additional degree of unsaturation (like another double bond or ring) which is not suggested by the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the spectral data uniquely and consistently point to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nAnalyse der spektralen Daten zur Bestimmung der Summenformel:\n\n1.  **Grad der Ungesättigtheit (Doppelbindungsäquivalente, DBÄ):**\n    *   Ein di-substituierter 6-gliedriger aromatischer Ring hat einen DBÄ von 4 (1 Ring + 3 Doppelbindungen).\n    *   Eine Estergruppe (-COO-) enthält eine Carbonylgruppe (C=O), was den DBÄ um 1 erhöht.\n    *   Die ¹H-NMR-Signale für Vinyl-H zeigen das Vorhandensein einer C=C-Doppelbindung an, was den DBÄ um ein weiteres 1 erhöht.\n    *   Der Gesamt-DBÄ der Struktur beträgt also 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n2.  **Berechnung des DBÄ für die gegebenen Optionen:**\n    Die Formel für den DBÄ lautet: DBÄ = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.

Es bleiben A (C12H14O2) und C (C11H12O2) übrig.\n\n3.  **Analyse der ¹H-NMR-Daten zur Bestimmung der Fragmente:**\n    *   **Aromatischer Teil:** Ein di-substituierter aromatischer Ring mit zwei Signalen für aromatische Protonen deutet auf eine symmetrische Substitution (z. B. para) mit insgesamt 4 aromatischen Protonen hin. Das Fragment ist **C6H4**.\n    *   **Vinyl-Teil:** Zwei Signale für Vinyl-H, ein Dublett und ein Dublett von Quartetts, sind charakteristisch für eine **Propenylgruppe (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Ein Vinylproton wird vom anderen zu einem Dublett aufgespalten. Das zweite Vinylproton wird vom ersten Vinylproton (Dublett) und von der benachbarten Methylgruppe (Quartett) zu einem Dublett von Quartetts aufgespalten. Dieses Fragment enthält 2 Vinyl-Protonen und eine CH3-Gruppe. Dies ist eines der beiden Methylsignale. Das Fragment ist **-C3H5** (2 Vinyl-H + 3 Methyl-H).\n    *   **Ester- und Methyl-Teil:** Das Spektrum zeigt zwei Signale für –CH3-Gruppen. Eines gehört zur Propenylgruppe. Das zweite muss Teil des Ester-Substituenten sein. Da es keine Signale für –CH2-Gruppen gibt, sind Ester wie Ethylester (-COOCH2CH3) ausgeschlossen. Die einzigen Möglichkeiten für ein esterhaltiges Fragment mit einer CH3-Gruppe und ohne CH2-Gruppen sind eine **Methylestergruppe (-COOCH3)** oder eine **Acetoxygruppe (-O-CO-CH3)**. Beide liefern ein Singulett für die Methylgruppe im NMR-Spektrum. Dieses Fragment ist **-C2H3O2** (3 Methyl-H + C + O2).\n\n4.  **Zusammensetzen der Fragmente zur Summenformel:**\n    *   Aromatischer Ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenylgruppe: C3H5\n    *   Ester-Methyl-Fragment: C2H3O2\n    *   **Summe:**\n        *   Kohlenstoff: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Wasserstoff: 4 (aromatisch) + 5 (Propenyl) + 3 (Ester-Methyl) = 12\n        *   Sauerstoff: 2\n    *   Die resultierende Summenformel ist **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Vergleich mit den verbleibenden Optionen:**\n    Die hergeleitete Formel C11H12O2 entspricht der Option C. Option A, C12H14O2, enthält ein zusätzliches Kohlenstoffatom und zwei zusätzliche Wasserstoffatome, was einer -CH2-Gruppe entsprechen würde, die durch die NMR-Daten explizit ausgeschlossen wird.\n\nDie Analyse aller spektroskopischen Daten führt eindeutig zur Summenformel C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
