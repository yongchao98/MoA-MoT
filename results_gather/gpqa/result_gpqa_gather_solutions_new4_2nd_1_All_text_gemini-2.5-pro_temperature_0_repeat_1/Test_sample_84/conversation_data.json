  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nTwo planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n*   `R_star` = Star's radius\n*   `A` = Planet's albedo\n*   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we can write:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out. The problem also states that the albedos are the same (`A₁ = A₂`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis means the ratio of the temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances. The next step is to find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`.\n\n### 3. Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`) and that the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90° (so `sin(i) ≈ 1`), which is a valid assumption for planets detected by the transit method.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the other variables:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a₂ / a₁`)\nUsing the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n`a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n    `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n    `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Ratio:**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    `Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å`\n    `Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å`\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n### 6. Combine Ratios and Solve\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, use this result to find the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This matches option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The problem provides extra information (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) that is not needed to solve for the *ratio* of the temperatures, as these common terms cancel out.\n*   The relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n*   The relationship between the star's RV semi-amplitude, planet mass, and semi-major axis is `K ∝ M_p / √a`.\n*   Combining these relationships leads to `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)`.\n*   The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n*   It is important to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the calculation.\n\nThe final calculation is `(5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28 ≈ 0.536`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires us to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, orbiting the same star.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{(1-A)R_{star}^2}{4a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    This can be simplified to show the proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. All other factors, such as the star's temperature ($T_{star}$), the star's radius ($R_{star}$), and the planet's albedo (A), are the same for both planets and will cancel out when we take the ratio.\n\n2.  **Temperature Ratio:** The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 ($T_{eq1}$) to Planet 2 ($T_{eq2}$) is therefore:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_1}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) and Orbital Parameters:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity method. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) caused by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets are detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n4.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observables:** We can rearrange the proportionality to express the semi-major axis in terms of the planet's mass and the star's radial velocity:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$\n    Therefore, $a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$.\n\n5.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Ratio of Radial Velocities:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Thus, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n7.  **Substitute Values:** We can now substitute the known ratios into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 M_{Earth}}{7 M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   RV ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Finally, we use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    Converting this fraction to a decimal:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n**Note:** The star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific wavelength of the spectral line, are extraneous information not needed for the final calculation of the ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting the same star.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out. The problem also states that the albedos are the same ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels. The formula simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data:**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$ (assuming $M_p \\ll M_{star}$ and orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which is a good assumption for transiting planets).\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    Using the relationship from the previous step, we can form the ratio:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)}$\n\n    The star's mass ($M_{star}$) cancels out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Determine the Ratio of RV Amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$):**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ.\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n6.  **Substitute Values and Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    We have the following ratios:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ M_Earth}}{7 \\text{ M_Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   RV amplitude ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    Now, we can substitute these into the temperature ratio formula derived by combining steps 2 and 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    Finally, we calculate the decimal value:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~ 1.05\n    B) ~ 1.30\n    C) ~ 0.53\n    D) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires us to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**Step 1: Formula for Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also states that the planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis (a) cancel out.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity wobble (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star) and that the orbital inclination (i) is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1). The fact that the planets were detected by the transit method makes the sin(i) ≈ 1 assumption valid.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a)\nK² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\n\nUsing the formula for 'a' from Step 2, we can create the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity**\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n*   The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values.\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n**Step 5: Substitute Ratios and Calculate a₂ / a₁**\n\nNow, substitute the mass and velocity ratios into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The problem provides extra information (star's mass, radius, temperature, planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line) that is not needed for the final calculation, as these values cancel out when dealing with ratios.\n*   The relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n*   The relationship between radial velocity amplitude, planet mass, and semi-major axis is K ∝ M_p / √a.\n*   The radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ.\n*   It is crucial to keep the subscripts (1 and 2) consistent throughout the calculation to get the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 and not its inverse.\n\nThe final calculated value is ~0.536, which corresponds to option A.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula and Simplification**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo, so A₁ = A₂, and the (1 - A)^(1/4) term cancels out.\n*   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n\nThis simplifies the expression to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nThis assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), and the orbital inclination is ~90° (sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a valid assumption for a system detected by both transit and RV methods.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nNow we can form the ratio a₂ / a₁. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Relating RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ)**\nThe radial velocity (v_r) is related to the Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula v_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀). The RV semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum radial velocity, so K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max).\nTherefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**6. Combining the Ratios**\nSubstitute the relationship from step 5 into the equation for a₂ / a₁ from step 4:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\nPlug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\n```python\nM_p1 = 7\nM_p2 = 5\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemp_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.\n\n**8.

Identify the Goal and Relevant Information**\nThe goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet 1 to that of Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula and Simplification**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, when we form the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1 / a₁) / √(1 / a₂)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. The problem now reduces to finding the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n\n**3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) caused by the orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for K is:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a) = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nNow we can form the ratio a₂ / a₁ using the expression for 'a'.\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of Radial Velocities (K₁ / K₂)**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift Δλ (from the formula K = c * Δλ / λ₀, where c and λ₀ are constants). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values.\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**6. Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\nSubstitute the expression for the K ratio into the equation for the 'a' ratio:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n**7.

Goal Identification**\nThe main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### **2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Temperature T_star, Radius R_star), the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis 'a'), and its albedo (A). The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis 'a':\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### **3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\nThe semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n(This assumes the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star, and the orbital inclination is ~90°, which is a valid assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for 'a':\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a)\nK² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### **4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the formula for 'a', we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### **5. Calculating the Ratio of Radial Velocities (K₁ / K₂)**\nThe radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where c and λ₀ are constants.\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nGiven:\nΔλ₁ = 0.03 Å\nΔλ₂ = 0.04 Å\nSo, K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n### **6. Calculating the Ratio of Planet Masses (M_p₂ / M_p₁)**\nGiven:\nM_p1 = 7 Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5 Earth masses\nSo, M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n\n### **7. Combining the Ratios**\nNow, substitute the mass and velocity ratios back into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n### **8. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires us to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**1. Plan**\n*   First, I will write down the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet and find the ratio for the two planets, simplifying it by canceling out common terms.\n*   Next, I will find the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a) and mass (M_p).\n*   Then, I will use the given Doppler shift values (Δλ) to find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2).\n*   Using these relationships, I will derive an expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1).\n*   Finally, I will substitute the expression for a2/a1 into the temperature ratio formula and plug in the given values to calculate the final answer.\n\n**2. Execution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is its radius, A is the planet's albedo, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\n    The ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem also states that the albedos are the same (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, leaving:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n*   **Step 2: Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    (This assumes M_p << M_star and an orbital inclination i ≈ 90°, which is a safe assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods).\n\n    Rearranging for 'a':\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a) = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n*   **Step 3: Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n    We can now find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out, giving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n*   **Step 4: Ratio of Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitudes**\n    The radial velocity (v_r) is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ), since v_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes (K) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts.\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n    Now we substitute the ratio of semi-major axes back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\n    Plugging in the given values for the masses and the calculated ratio for the Doppler shifts:\n    M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 3/4\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.53. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula and Ratio**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   a = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance)\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. It also states that the albedos are the same (A₁ = A₂), so the (1-A) term cancels out. The constant '2' also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**3. Relate Radial Velocity (RV) to Orbital Parameters**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star, induced by a planet in a circular orbit, is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star) and that the orbital inclination is close to 90° (sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of K and M_p:\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a) = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\nTherefore, a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the formula for 'a', we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Velocity**\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K):**\n    The radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**6. Substitute Ratios and Calculate the Final Result**\nNow we can substitute these ratios back into the equation for the temperature ratio. A more direct method is to first find the ratio of the semi-major axes and then take the square root.\n\n*   **Calculate a₂ / a₁:**\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n*   **Calculate T_eq1 / T_eq2:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n*   **Final Numerical Value:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

All of this information is unnecessary for calculating the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these values cancel out.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** It is crucial to correctly set up the ratios.

This is justified because the planets are detected by the transit method, which requires the orbit to be viewed nearly edge-on.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, they failed to select the correct corresponding letter from the options provided in the prompt.

The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 and Planet 2, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem also states they have the same albedo (A). Therefore, these terms cancel out when we take the ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left(1/a_1\\right)^{1/2}}{\\left(1/a_2\\right)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n2.  **Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity wobble (K). For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n    (This simplified formula assumes the planet's mass, $M_p$, is much smaller than the star's mass, $M_{star}$, and that the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a safe assumption for planets detected by the transit method).\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** We can rearrange the formula for K to express the semi-major axis, `a`, in terms of the other variables:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratios of Mass and Velocity:**\n    *   The ratio of the planet masses is:\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ).

The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, C, or D) despite the same numerical result (~0.53) suggests that the options may have been presented in a different order to each agent. The correct approach is to perform the calculation from first principles and then match the result to the options given in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties (effective temperature $T_{star}$ and radius $R_{star}$), the planet's albedo (A), and its semi-major axis (a). The relationship is:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1-A}{a^2}}$\n    Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters**: The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) that a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star of mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    This approximation is valid because the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), and the system is detected by the transit method, which implies an orbital inclination close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1).\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: From the RV formula, we can see the relationship between the semi-major axis, planet mass, and RV semi-amplitude:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$\n    Therefore, $a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$.\n    The ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratios from Given Data**:\n    *   The ratio of the planet masses is:\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   The RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio**: Now we can substitute these ratios back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1 and Step 3.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Final Numerical Answer**:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out.\n*   **Assumptions**: The solution relies on the assumption that the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90° for both planets, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. This is a standard and justified assumption because the planets are detected by the transit method. It is also assumed the planets are co-planar, so `sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2)`.\n*   **Formulae**: It is crucial to use the correct proportionality. The equilibrium temperature $T_{eq}$ is proportional to $a^{-1/2}$, and the radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is proportional to $M_p \\cdot a^{-1/2}$. Combining these leads to the final relationship $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2} = (M_{p2}/M_{p1}) \\cdot (K_1/K_2)$.\n*   **Index Management**: Careful tracking of subscripts (1 for Planet1, 2 for Planet2) is essential to avoid inverting the ratios.

Since both planets orbit the same star, $T_{eff}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. The problem also states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for both planets. Therefore, these terms cancel out when we take the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$, using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, $K$, for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}} \\frac{\\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n(This approximation is valid for $M_p \\ll M_{star}$ and an orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet).\n\nFrom this, we can establish a proportionality for the semi-major axis:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$\n\nNow we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe ratio of the planet masses is:\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, A is the planet's albedo, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. It also states that the albedos are the same (A₁ = A₂), so the (1-A) term cancels out. The constant '2' also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n5.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) caused by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    (This assumes M_p << M_star and an orbital inclination of 90°, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet).\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging the formula to solve for 'a':\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n8.  **Determine the Ratio of Radial Velocities (K₁ / K₂):** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n9.  **Substitute Known Values:** We have the mass ratio and the velocity ratio:\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   Velocity ratio: K₁ / K₂ = 3 / 4\n\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for the ratio of semi-major axes:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.53. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, 'a'). The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   a = Planet's semi-major axis\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axes (a₁ and a₂).\n\nThe simplified ratio is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the problem reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n### 3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe radial velocity (RV) method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's wobble (K), which is caused by the planet's gravity. For a planet in a circular orbit, where the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), K is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / √(M_star * a) * √G\n\nSince the planets are detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbital inclination (i) is close to 90°, making sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ M_p / √(M_star * a)\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of K and M_p:\n√a ∝ M_p / K\na ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up the ratio for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 5. Calculating the Input Ratios\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K₁ / K₂):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ).\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n### 6. Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio\nNow, we can substitute these ratios back into the equations.\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25/49) * (9/16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\nNext, use this to find the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully calculates the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets.\n\nThe plan is executed as follows:\n1.  The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and its semi-major axis (a) is established: T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). This leads to the ratio: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).\n2.  The relationship between the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K), the planet's mass (M_p), and the semi-major axis (a) is used: K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a).\n3.  This is rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of mass and radial velocity: a is proportional to (M_p / K)².\n4.  The ratio of the semi-major axes is then found: a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)².\n5.  The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), so the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n6.  Combining these relationships gives the final formula used in the code: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂).\n7.  The code substitutes the given values: M_p1 = 7, M_p2 = 5, Δλ₁ = 0.03, and Δλ₂ = 0.04.\n8.  The calculation is performed: (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357.\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.536 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, its temperature is related to its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, `a`). The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   a = Planet's semi-major axis\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 (T_eq1) and Planet 2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. The problem also states that the albedos are the same (A₁ = A₂), so the (1-A) term also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. The next step is to find the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n\n**2. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) of a star, induced by a planet in a circular orbit, is given by the formula:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis formula is valid because the planets are detected by the transit method, implying the orbital inclination (i) is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1. Also, the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a)\nK² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratios from Given Data**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values.\n\n*   Ratio of Doppler shifts (and thus RV semi-amplitudes):\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n*   Ratio of planetary masses:\n    M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5 / 7\n\nNow, substitute these ratios into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, we use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nAn analysis of the provided solutions reveals a consistent physical derivation, although there are discrepancies in the final selected options. The correct approach involves several steps that link the observable Doppler shifts to the planets' equilibrium temperatures.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Temperature T_star, Radius R_star), the planet's albedo (A), and its semi-major axis (a). The relationship is T_eq ∝ (1/√a).\n    Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n3.  **Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, the formula is:\n    K ∝ M_p / √a\n    This can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis:\n    a ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the relationship from the previous step, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n5.  **Ratio of Radial Velocities:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n6.  **Calculation:** Now we can substitute the known ratios into the equation for the temperature ratio. There are two equivalent ways to proceed:\n\n    *   **Method 1 (as seen in Answer 1, 2, 6, etc.):** First, calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n        *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n        *   RV ratio: K₁ / K₂ = 3 / 4\n        *   a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n        *   Then, take the square root for the temperature ratio:\n            T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    *   **Method 2 (as seen in Answer 4, 12, 13, 14):** Substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio directly into the temperature ratio formula.\n        *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²]\n        *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n        *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    Both methods yield the same result: the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately **0.536**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii. As shown in the derivation, these values are not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as they cancel out. They are distractors.\n*   **Assumptions:** The derivation relies on the assumption that the orbital inclination (i) is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1) for both planets. This is a reasonable assumption because the problem states the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires the orbit to be nearly edge-on.\n*   **Consistency Check:** Nearly all candidate answers arrive at the same numerical result (~0.536) through a correct derivation, which increases confidence in the calculation.

    "An analysis of the provided answers shows a consistent and correct physical derivation across almost all candidates, leading to the same numerical result. The discrepancies arise from incorrectly matching the calculated number to the given lettered options. Here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2, denoted as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is its radius, `A` is the planet's albedo, and `a` is the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we divide the expression for Planet 1 by that for Planet 2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a₂ / a₁`.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (`K`) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nThis approximation is valid as the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), and the detection by the transit method implies an orbital inclination `i` close to 90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nFrom this formula, we can establish a proportionality. Since `G` and `M_star` are constant for both planets:\n`K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)`\nRearranging to solve for `a`:\n`sqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K  =>  a ∝ (M_p / K)²`\n\n**4. Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)² = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n**5. Combining Formulas for a Direct Solution:**\nWe can substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 2:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )`\nThe square root cancels the squares, leading to a very direct relationship:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n\n**6. Calculating the Component Ratios:**\n*   **Mass Ratio:** `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7`\n*   **Radial Velocity Ratio:** The RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of `K` values is the same as the ratio of `Δλ` values.\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4`\n\n**7. Final Calculation:**\nSubstitute the calculated ratios into the simplified formula from Step 5:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28`\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately **0.536**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides a significant amount of data that is not needed to find the ratio, including the star's mass, radius, and temperature, the planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line. These are distractors.\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that for a transiting planet, the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n*   **Ratio Management:** It is crucial to keep the subscripts (1 and 2) consistent throughout the derivation to avoid accidentally calculating the inverse ratio (`T_eq2 / T_eq1`). The derivation `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)` is correct.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value `~0.536` must be compared to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.05\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 0.98\n    D) ~ 1.30\nThe result clearly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n*   `R_star` = Star's radius\n*   `A` = Planet's albedo\n*   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n\nTo find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`, we can write:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out. The problem also states that the albedos are the same (`A₁ = A₂`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\nThis means the ratio of the temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances. The next step is to find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`.\n\n### 3. Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`) and that the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90° (so `sin(i) ≈ 1`), which is a valid assumption for planets detected by the transit method.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the other variables:\n`K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)`\n`a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a₂ / a₁`)\nUsing the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n`a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n    `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n    `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Ratio:**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    `Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å`\n    `Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å`\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n### 6. Combine Ratios and Solve\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n`a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, use this result to find the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This matches option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The problem provides extra information (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) that is not needed to solve for the *ratio* of the temperatures, as these common terms cancel out.\n*   The relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`.\n*   The relationship between the star's RV semi-amplitude, planet mass, and semi-major axis is `K ∝ M_p / √a`.\n*   Combining these relationships leads to `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)`.\n*   The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n*   It is important to keep the indices (1 and 2) consistent throughout the calculation.\n\nThe final calculation is `(5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28 ≈ 0.536`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires us to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2, orbiting the same star.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{(1-A)R_{star}^2}{4a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    This can be simplified to show the proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. All other factors, such as the star's temperature ($T_{star}$), the star's radius ($R_{star}$), and the planet's albedo (A), are the same for both planets and will cancel out when we take the ratio.\n\n2.  **Temperature Ratio:** The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 ($T_{eq1}$) to Planet 2 ($T_{eq2}$) is therefore:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{a_1}}{1/\\sqrt{a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) and Orbital Parameters:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity method. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) caused by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets are detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n4.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observables:** We can rearrange the proportionality to express the semi-major axis in terms of the planet's mass and the star's radial velocity:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$\n    Therefore, $a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$.\n\n5.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Ratio of Radial Velocities:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Thus, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n7.  **Substitute Values:** We can now substitute the known ratios into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 M_{Earth}}{7 M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   RV ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Finally, we use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    Converting this fraction to a decimal:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n**Note:** The star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii and the specific wavelength of the spectral line, are extraneous information not needed for the final calculation of the ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting the same star.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out. The problem also states that the albedos are the same ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels. The formula simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data:**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$ (assuming $M_p \\ll M_{star}$ and orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which is a good assumption for transiting planets).\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    Using the relationship from the previous step, we can form the ratio:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)}$\n\n    The star's mass ($M_{star}$) cancels out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Determine the Ratio of RV Amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$):**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ.\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    Therefore, the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n6.  **Substitute Values and Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    We have the following ratios:\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ M_Earth}}{7 \\text{ M_Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   RV amplitude ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    Now, we can substitute these into the temperature ratio formula derived by combining steps 2 and 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    Finally, we calculate the decimal value:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n    This value is approximately 0.53.

It also states that the planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis (a) cancel out.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this velocity wobble (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star) and that the orbital inclination (i) is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1). The fact that the planets were detected by the transit method makes the sin(i) ≈ 1 assumption valid.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a)\nK² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\n\nUsing the formula for 'a' from Step 2, we can create the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Ratios of Mass and Radial Velocity**\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n*   The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values.\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n**Step 5: Substitute Ratios and Calculate a₂ / a₁**\n\nNow, substitute the mass and velocity ratios into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The problem provides extra information (star's mass, radius, temperature, planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line) that is not needed for the final calculation, as these values cancel out when dealing with ratios.\n*   The relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n*   The relationship between radial velocity amplitude, planet mass, and semi-major axis is K ∝ M_p / √a.\n*   The radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ.\n*   It is crucial to keep the subscripts (1 and 2) consistent throughout the calculation to get the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 and not its inverse.\n\nThe final calculated value is ~0.536, which corresponds to option A.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula and Simplification**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo, so A₁ = A₂, and the (1 - A)^(1/4) term cancels out.\n*   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n\nThis simplifies the expression to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nThis assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), and the orbital inclination is ~90° (sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a valid assumption for a system detected by both transit and RV methods.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nNow we can form the ratio a₂ / a₁. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Relating RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ)**\nThe radial velocity (v_r) is related to the Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula v_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀). The RV semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum radial velocity, so K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max).\nTherefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**6. Combining the Ratios**\nSubstitute the relationship from step 5 into the equation for a₂ / a₁ from step 4:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**7.

Identify the Goal and Relevant Information**\nThe goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet 1 to that of Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula and Simplification**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, when we form the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1 / a₁) / √(1 / a₂)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. The problem now reduces to finding the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n\n**3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) caused by the orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for K is:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a) = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nNow we can form the ratio a₂ / a₁ using the expression for 'a'.\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of Radial Velocities (K₁ / K₂)**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift Δλ (from the formula K = c * Δλ / λ₀, where c and λ₀ are constants). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values.\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**6. Combine Formulas and Substitute Values**\nSubstitute the expression for the K ratio into the equation for the 'a' ratio:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √[ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n**7.

Goal Identification**\nThe main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### **2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Temperature T_star, Radius R_star), the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis 'a'), and its albedo (A). The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axis 'a':\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### **3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\nThe semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) induced on a star by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n(This assumes the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star, and the orbital inclination is ~90°, which is a valid assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for 'a':\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a)\nK² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### **4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the formula for 'a', we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### **5. Calculating the Ratio of Radial Velocities (K₁ / K₂)**\nThe radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where c and λ₀ are constants.\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nGiven:\nΔλ₁ = 0.03 Å\nΔλ₂ = 0.04 Å\nSo, K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n### **6. Calculating the Ratio of Planet Masses (M_p₂ / M_p₁)**\nGiven:\nM_p1 = 7 Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5 Earth masses\nSo, M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n\n### **7. Combining the Ratios**\nNow, substitute the mass and velocity ratios back into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n### **8. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ into the temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires us to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**1. Plan**\n*   First, I will write down the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet and find the ratio for the two planets, simplifying it by canceling out common terms.\n*   Next, I will find the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a) and mass (M_p).\n*   Then, I will use the given Doppler shift values (Δλ) to find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2).\n*   Using these relationships, I will derive an expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1).\n*   Finally, I will substitute the expression for a2/a1 into the temperature ratio formula and plug in the given values to calculate the final answer.\n\n**2. Execution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is its radius, A is the planet's albedo, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\n    The ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem also states that the albedos are the same (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, leaving:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n*   **Step 2: Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**\n    The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    (This assumes M_p << M_star and an orbital inclination i ≈ 90°, which is a safe assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods).\n\n    Rearranging for 'a':\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a) = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n*   **Step 3: Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n    We can now find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out, giving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n*   **Step 4: Ratio of Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitudes**\n    The radial velocity (v_r) is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ), since v_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes (K) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts.\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n    Now we substitute the ratio of semi-major axes back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n\n    Plugging in the given values for the masses and the calculated ratio for the Doppler shifts:\n    M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 3/4\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.53. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula and Ratio**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   a = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance)\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. It also states that the albedos are the same (A₁ = A₂), so the (1-A) term cancels out. The constant '2' also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**3. Relate Radial Velocity (RV) to Orbital Parameters**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star, induced by a planet in a circular orbit, is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nThis formula assumes the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star) and that the orbital inclination is close to 90° (sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of K and M_p:\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a) = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\nTherefore, a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\nUsing the formula for 'a', we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and Velocity**\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K):**\n    The radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**6. Substitute Ratios and Calculate the Final Result**\nNow we can substitute these ratios back into the equation for the temperature ratio. A more direct method is to first find the ratio of the semi-major axes and then take the square root.\n\n*   **Calculate a₂ / a₁:**\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n*   **Calculate T_eq1 / T_eq2:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n*   **Final Numerical Value:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

All of this information is unnecessary for calculating the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these values cancel out.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** It is crucial to correctly set up the ratios. The question asks for T_eq1 / T_eq2.

This is justified because the planets are detected by the transit method, which requires the orbit to be viewed nearly edge-on.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, they failed to select the correct corresponding letter from the options provided in the prompt.

The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 and Planet 2, $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Since both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem also states they have the same albedo (A). Therefore, these terms cancel out when we take the ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left(1/a_1\\right)^{1/2}}{\\left(1/a_2\\right)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n2.  **Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity wobble (K). For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n    (This simplified formula assumes the planet's mass, $M_p$, is much smaller than the star's mass, $M_{star}$, and that the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a safe assumption for planets detected by the transit method).\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** We can rearrange the formula for K to express the semi-major axis, `a`, in terms of the other variables:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$\n\n    Now, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratios of Mass and Velocity:**\n    *   The ratio of the planet masses is:\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio:** We can now substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, C, or D) despite the same numerical result (~0.53) suggests that the options may have been presented in a different order to each agent. The correct approach is to perform the calculation from first principles and then match the result to the options given in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties (effective temperature $T_{star}$ and radius $R_{star}$), the planet's albedo (A), and its semi-major axis (a). The relationship is:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1-A}{a^2}}$\n    Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Orbital Parameters**: The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) that a planet of mass $M_p$ induces on its star of mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    This approximation is valid because the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), and the system is detected by the transit method, which implies an orbital inclination close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1).\n\n3.  **Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**: From the RV formula, we can see the relationship between the semi-major axis, planet mass, and RV semi-amplitude:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$\n    Therefore, $a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$.\n    The ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratios from Given Data**:\n    *   The ratio of the planet masses is:\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   The RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio**: Now we can substitute these ratios back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 1 and Step 3.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Final Numerical Answer**:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

This information is not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as these terms cancel out.\n*   **Assumptions**: The solution relies on the assumption that the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90° for both planets, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. This is a standard and justified assumption because the planets are detected by the transit method. It is also assumed the planets are co-planar, so `sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2)`.\n*   **Formulae**: It is crucial to use the correct proportionality. The equilibrium temperature $T_{eq}$ is proportional to $a^{-1/2}$, and the radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is proportional to $M_p \\cdot a^{-1/2}$. Combining these leads to the final relationship $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2} = (M_{p2}/M_{p1}) \\cdot (K_1/K_2)$.\n*   **Index Management**: Careful tracking of subscripts (1 for Planet1, 2 for Planet2) is essential to avoid inverting the ratios.

Since both planets orbit the same star, $T_{eff}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. The problem also states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for both planets. Therefore, these terms cancel out when we take the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$, using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, $K$, for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}} \\frac{\\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n(This approximation is valid for $M_p \\ll M_{star}$ and an orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet).\n\nFrom this, we can establish a proportionality for the semi-major axis:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K} \\implies a \\propto \\left(\\frac{M_p}{K}\\right)^2$\n\nNow we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe ratio of the planet masses is:\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, A is the planet's albedo, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. It also states that the albedos are the same (A₁ = A₂), so the (1-A) term cancels out. The constant '2' also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1/a₁) / sqrt(1/a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n5.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) caused by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    (This assumes M_p << M_star and an orbital inclination of 90°, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet).\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging the formula to solve for 'a':\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n8.  **Determine the Ratio of Radial Velocities (K₁ / K₂):** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n9.  **Substitute Known Values:** We have the mass ratio and the velocity ratio:\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   Velocity ratio: K₁ / K₂ = 3 / 4\n\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for the ratio of semi-major axes:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.53. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, 'a'). The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   a = Planet's semi-major axis\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, we can write:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, all terms cancel out except for the semi-major axes (a₁ and a₂).\n\nThe simplified ratio is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the problem reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n### 3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe radial velocity (RV) method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's wobble (K), which is caused by the planet's gravity. For a planet in a circular orbit, where the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), K is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / √(M_star * a) * √G\n\nSince the planets are detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbital inclination (i) is close to 90°, making sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ M_p / √(M_star * a)\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis 'a' in terms of K and M_p:\n√a ∝ M_p / K\na ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up the ratio for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 5. Calculating the Input Ratios\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K₁ / K₂):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ).\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n### 6. Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio\nNow, we can substitute these ratios back into the equations.\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25/49) * (9/16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\nNext, use this to find the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully calculates the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets.\n\nThe plan is executed as follows:\n1.  The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and its semi-major axis (a) is established: T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). This leads to the ratio: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).\n2.  The relationship between the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K), the planet's mass (M_p), and the semi-major axis (a) is used: K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a).\n3.  This is rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of mass and radial velocity: a is proportional to (M_p / K)².\n4.  The ratio of the semi-major axes is then found: a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)².\n5.  The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), so the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n6.  Combining these relationships gives the final formula used in the code: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂).\n7.  The code substitutes the given values: M_p1 = 7, M_p2 = 5, Δλ₁ = 0.03, and Δλ₂ = 0.04.\n8.  The calculation is performed: (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357.\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.536 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Relationship**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, its temperature is related to its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, `a`). The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   a = Planet's semi-major axis\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 (T_eq1) and Planet 2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out. The problem also states that the albedos are the same (A₁ = A₂), so the (1-A) term also cancels. This simplifies the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1/a₁) / √(1/a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. The next step is to find the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n\n**2. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) of a star, induced by a planet in a circular orbit, is given by the formula:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis formula is valid because the planets are detected by the transit method, implying the orbital inclination (i) is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1. Also, the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² ≈ (M_p² * G * M_star) / (M_star² * a)\nK² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratios from Given Data**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values.\n\n*   Ratio of Doppler shifts (and thus RV semi-amplitudes):\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n*   Ratio of planetary masses:\n    M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5 / 7\n\nNow, substitute these ratios into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, we use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nAn analysis of the provided solutions reveals a consistent physical derivation, although there are discrepancies in the final selected options. The correct approach involves several steps that link the observable Doppler shifts to the planets' equilibrium temperatures.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (Temperature T_star, Radius R_star), the planet's albedo (A), and its semi-major axis (a). The relationship is T_eq ∝ (1/√a).\n    Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n3.  **Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, the formula is:\n    K ∝ M_p / √a\n    This can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis:\n    a ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the relationship from the previous step, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n5.  **Ratio of Radial Velocities:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n6.  **Calculation:** Now we can substitute the known ratios into the equation for the temperature ratio. There are two equivalent ways to proceed:\n\n    *   **Method 1 (as seen in Answer 1, 2, 6, etc.):** First, calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n        *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n        *   RV ratio: K₁ / K₂ = 3 / 4\n        *   a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n        *   Then, take the square root for the temperature ratio:\n            T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    *   **Method 2 (as seen in Answer 4, 12, 13, 14):** Substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio directly into the temperature ratio formula.\n        *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²]\n        *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)\n        *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    Both methods yield the same result: the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately **0.536**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the star's mass, radius, and effective temperature, as well as the planets' radii. As shown in the derivation, these values are not needed to calculate the *ratio* of the equilibrium temperatures, as they cancel out. They are distractors.\n*   **Assumptions:** The derivation relies on the assumption that the orbital inclination (i) is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1) for both planets. This is a reasonable assumption because the problem states the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires the orbit to be nearly edge-on.\n*   **Consistency Check:** Nearly all candidate answers arrive at the same numerical result (~0.536) through a correct derivation, which increases confidence in the calculation. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, C, D) are likely due to errors in matching the result to the options, possibly from a differently ordered list of choices.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is ~0.536. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    *   A) ~ 1.30\n    *   B) ~ 0.53\n    *   C) ~ 1.05\n    *   D) ~ 0.98\n\nThe value 0.536 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
