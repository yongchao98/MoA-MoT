For C₈H₉NO, the DBE is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (>9 ppm) and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH₂-). This confirms a -CH₂CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a doublet for two protons, confirming a methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to a single proton (-CH). This is consistent with the -CH₂CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling the fragments (a para-substituted ring, an -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂CHO group) leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(acetaldehyde)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H₂O:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This final step uses a strong base (KOH) and heat. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons. These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Final Product of the Aldol Condensation**\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to option (D).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The problem specifies that the reaction is **heated**. Heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms a stable carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This structure perfectly matches the final product derived from the self-aldol condensation reaction under heat.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; not a product of self-condensation.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated, which drives the dehydration to the more stable condensation product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the complete reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct final product.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material (C₈H₉NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C₈H₉NO. The DBE is calculated as: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Interpretation:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity means it's coupled to two adjacent protons, indicating a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet multiplicity means it's coupled to one adjacent proton, which confirms its position next to the aldehyde proton. This reinforces the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   **Structure Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    *   This is a well-established two-step process. The first step is the **diazotization** of the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    *   The second step is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt with water, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step uses a strong base (KOH) and heat on the aldehyde produced in the previous step. These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Critical Point:** The reaction involves two distinct stages: aldol addition and dehydration (condensation).\n        *   **Addition:** The base creates an enolate from one aldehyde molecule, which then attacks a second aldehyde molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **\"Heat\"** is a crucial detail. It provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is favorable because it creates a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated system.\n    *   **Final Product Conclusion:** Because the reaction is heated, it will not stop at the aldol addition stage. The final product is the dehydrated condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Matching with Final Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (missing -OH groups) and wrong double bond position.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   D) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after the complete aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration). This matches our derived final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a multi-step analysis, starting from the identification of the initial reactant and following it through a sequence of three chemical reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C8H9NO, DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift and triplet splitting pattern are definitive for an aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH₂-). This confirms a -CH₂CHO fragment and accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation (C=O bond).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents the methylene group (-CH₂-). Its doublet splitting confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments (a para-substituted ring, an -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂CHO group) leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    *   This is a standard two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   Step 1 (Diazotization): The primary amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   Step 2 (Hydrolysis): The diazonium salt is treated with water, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. These conditions (a strong base and heat) are classic for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton (from the -CH₂- group) of one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n        b.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The key is the presence of **Heat**. This condition promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of the intermediate (Option B) yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Matching the Final Product to the Options**\n\n*   The final product derived from the complete reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This matches our derived final product.\n    *   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure (lacks hydroxyl groups, wrong double bond position).\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material.**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C8H9NO, the DBE is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.

Identification of the Starting Material**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The Degree of Unsaturation is 5, which suggests a benzene ring (4) and a carbonyl group (1).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: An aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to a -CH2- group.\n    *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: A methylene group (-CH2-) coupled to a single proton (-CH), confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: A classic pattern for a 1,4- (para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   **Conclusion:** All candidate answers correctly assemble these fragments to identify the starting material as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n*   **Step 2: H2O:** This step hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Intermediate Product:** The product after the first two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.

This structure corresponds to **Option C**.\n    *   However, the reaction is performed with **Heat**. This is a critical detail. Heating promotes the dehydration (loss of H₂O) of the aldol addition product to form the more thermodynamically stable **aldol condensation product**.\n    *   The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**4. Matching the Final Product to the Options**\n*   The derived final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   Let's compare this to the provided options:\n    *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n    *   B) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This perfectly matches the derived final product.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - This is not a self-condensation product.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemical reasoning is consistent across almost all candidate answers. The final product is the result of a self-aldol condensation, which, due to the \"Heat\" condition, proceeds to the dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The structure of this product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, which corresponds to option B. The wide variation in the final lettered answers from the candidates is due to them being presented with different option letterings, not a disagreement on the chemical outcome.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C₈H₉NO. The DBE is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting means it is coupled to two adjacent protons, indicating a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, as the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). This electron-donating group explains the upfield chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\n3.  **Structure Assembly:** Combining the identified fragments—a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH₂), and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)—gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula and all NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    *   This is a two-step process. The first step is a **diazotization** reaction, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The second step is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt with water, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group). The reaction conditions (a strong base like KOH and heat) are classic for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The key condition here is **\"Heat\"**. Heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, as the new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the final product.\n\nThe dehydration of the intermediate, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, yields the final product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's compare this to the given options:\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This is structurally incorrect and not a product of self-condensation.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the final, dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the aldol condensation. This matches our derived structure.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This is incorrect as it is missing the hydroxyl groups from the Sandmeyer reaction and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n\nThe correct final product is the result of the complete aldol condensation, which includes the dehydration step driven by heat.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material.**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C8H9NO, the DBE is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), indicating a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is for a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the coupling to the single aldehyde proton, solidifying the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). The amine is an electron-donating group, which explains why the aromatic protons are shifted to a relatively upfield position.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling the pieces—a para-substituted ring with an -NH₂ group and a -CH₂CHO group—gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(acetaldehyde)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H₂O:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This is the final step. The reactant is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which is an aldehyde possessing acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group). The conditions of a strong base (KOH) and heat are classic for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product from the aldol condensation.**\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) deprotonates the α-carbon of one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**, which corresponds to **Option C**.\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The problem specifies that the reaction is **heated**. Heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   **Final Product:** The dehydration of the intermediate (Option C) yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe question asks for the final product of the entire sequence. The inclusion of \"Heat\" in the last step is a critical instruction, indicating that the reaction does not stop at the aldol addition stage (Option C) but proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated condensation product (Option D).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C₈H₉NO. The DBE is calculated as: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

This, along with the aldehyde signal, confirms the **-CH₂CHO** (acetaldehyde) side chain.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group **(-NH₂)**.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments (a para-disubstituted ring, an -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂CHO group) leads to a single possible structure: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This is consistently and correctly identified by all the detailed candidate answers.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O**\n    *   This is a standard two-step process. The first part (NaNO₂ + HCl) is a **diazotization** reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    *   The second part (H₂O) is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt, where the -N₂⁺ group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   The conditions of a strong base (KOH) and heat are classic for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n### Step 3: Determination of the Final Product\n\nThe key to this step is understanding the difference between an aldol addition and an aldol condensation.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) creates an enolate from one molecule, which then attacks a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. For this reaction, the product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure matches option **(D)**.\n*   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The problem explicitly states that **heat** is applied. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. This is a highly favorable process as it creates a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal removes the -OH from C3 and an H from C2, creating a double bond. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure matches option **(C)**.\n\n### Conclusion and Decision\n\nThe chemical reasoning is straightforward. The reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because heat is applied, the reaction does not stop at the aldol addition product (D) but proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated condensation product (C).\n\nMany of the candidate answers correctly identified the chemical pathway but then failed to match the final product to the correct letter option. The most thorough and accurate analyses (e.g., Answers 2, 7, 8, 9, 11) correctly identify the final product as 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal and match it to option C.\n\nTherefore, the final product is the aldol condensation product, not the aldol addition product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C8H9NO, the DBE is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atom.\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group).\n    *   The strong base (KOH) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    *   The presence of **heat** is a crucial condition that promotes the **dehydration** (loss of a water molecule) of this intermediate. The hydroxyl group at the β-position (C3) and a proton from the α-position (C2) are eliminated to form a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of the Final Product\n\nThe dehydration of the intermediate (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) results in the formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the expected final product of the aldol condensation.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This is not a product of self-condensation and is structurally incorrect.\n\nThe entire reaction sequence leads to the formation of the dehydrated aldol condensation product because of the heating in the final step.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C₈H₉NO. The DBE is calculated as: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), suggesting a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms its position next to the aldehyde proton, validating the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pair of doublets in the aromatic region is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Structure Assembly:** Combining these fragments—a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH₂), and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)—leads to the unambiguous structure of **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe identified starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(acetaldehyde)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H₂O:** The diazonium salt is subsequently hydrolyzed by water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This step forms the intermediate **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This final step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThis step requires careful consideration of the reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms the aldol *addition* product, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to **Option A**.\n\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** A crucial point is the presence of **\"Heat\"**. Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of a base promotes dehydration (the elimination of a water molecule). The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a stable carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Final Product:** The dehydration leads to an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure corresponds to **Option D**. Since the reaction is heated, the condensation product is the expected final product, not the intermediate addition product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the complete analysis of the reaction sequence, the starting material is converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration due to heat) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n*   **Option A** is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heat.\n*   **Option B** and **Option C** are structurally incorrect.\n*   **Option D** is the correct final product of the aldol condensation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

A DBE of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Interpretation:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity means it's coupled to two adjacent protons, indicating a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet multiplicity means it's coupled to one adjacent proton, which confirms its position next to the aldehyde proton. This reinforces the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   **Structure Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    *   This is a well-established two-step process. The first step is the **diazotization** of the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    *   The second step is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt with water, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step uses a strong base (KOH) and heat on the aldehyde produced in the previous step. These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Critical Point:** The reaction involves two distinct stages: aldol addition and dehydration (condensation).\n        *   **Addition:** The base creates an enolate from one aldehyde molecule, which then attacks a second aldehyde molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.

For C8H9NO, DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift and triplet splitting pattern are definitive for an aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH₂-). This confirms a -CH₂CHO fragment and accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation (C=O bond).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents the methylene group (-CH₂-).

The DBE is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting means it is coupled to two adjacent protons, indicating a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, as the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).

This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. For this reaction, the product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure matches option **(D)**.\n*   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The problem explicitly states that **heat** is applied. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. This is a highly favorable process as it creates a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal removes the -OH from C3 and an H from C2, creating a double bond. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure matches option **(C)**.\n\n### Conclusion and Decision\n\nThe chemical reasoning is straightforward. The reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because heat is applied, the reaction does not stop at the aldol addition product (D) but proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated condensation product (C).\n\nMany of the candidate answers correctly identified the chemical pathway but then failed to match the final product to the correct letter option. The most thorough and accurate analyses (e.g., Answers 2, 7, 8, 9, 11) correctly identify the final product as 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal and match it to option C.\n\nTherefore, the final product is the aldol condensation product, not the aldol addition product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C8H9NO, the DBE is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atom.\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), suggesting a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, as the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). The electron-donating nature of the amine group explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling the fragments (a para-disubstituted ring, an -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂CHO group) gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(acetaldehyde)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H₂O:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by water (usually with gentle heating). The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product of the aldol condensation.**\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms the aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The key here is the \"Heat\" condition. Heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms a stable carbon-carbon double bond between the α and β carbons.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is the dehydrated, α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; not a dimerization product.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate. It is not the final product because the reaction is heated, which drives the dehydration.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, stable aldol condensation product formed after dehydration. This structure matches our derived product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step verification of the chemical process, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is 5, which suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet splitting confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. Together, these signals confirm a `-CH₂CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments confirms the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction.

KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation. The base (KOH) catalyzes the reaction, and the heat drives it to completion by causing dehydration.\n\n### Step 3: The Aldol Condensation\n\n*   The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which has acidic α-protons on the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde group.\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option A).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** is a critical detail. It promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   **Final Product:** The final, dehydrated product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the derived final product with the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This is structurally incorrect and not a product of this self-condensation.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This correctly represents the final, stable product after the aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration).\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n\nThe correct final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script successfully executed the logical deduction for the multi-step synthesis.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The script correctly identified the starting material as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde by interpreting the provided NMR data.\n2.  **Intermediate:** It correctly determined that the diazotization and hydrolysis steps would convert the starting material into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n3.  **Final Product:** The script correctly reasoned that a self-aldol condensation under heat would lead to a dehydration reaction, forming the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The derived final product was compared against the given options, and it was found to be a perfect match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct final product.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C₈H₉NO, the DBE is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity means it is coupled to two adjacent protons, indicating a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, as the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\n3.  **Structure Assembly:** Combining these fragments—a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH₂), and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O:** This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   The first step (NaNO₂ + HCl) is a **diazotization** reaction, which converts the -NH₂ group into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The second step (H₂O, with warming) is a **hydrolysis** reaction that replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq.

The hydroxyl group at the β-position (C3) and a proton from the α-position (C2) are eliminated to form a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of the Final Product\n\nThe dehydration of the intermediate (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) results in the formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the expected final product of the aldol condensation.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This is not a product of self-condensation and is structurally incorrect.\n\nThe entire reaction sequence leads to the formation of the dehydrated aldol condensation product because of the heating in the final step.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C₈H₉NO. The DBE is calculated as: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO).
