As the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), the polygon approaches the shape of a circle.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: It is crucial to correctly identify the radius of this resulting circle. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. In the limit as N → ∞, the apothem becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a **circular aperture of radius 'a'**.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Physics of Diffraction**\nWhen light passes through a circular aperture, it undergoes Fraunhofer diffraction, creating a pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima**\nThe intensity minima occur at angles θ where the argument of the Bessel function, `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, is a non-trivial zero of J₁(x).\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-trivial zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`) given in the problem, the formula becomes:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n**Step 4: Use the Zeros of the Bessel Function**\nTo find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\n*   **First Minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   **Careful Point 2**: This value, approximately `0.610 λ/a`, corresponds to option A. However, this is the angular position of the *first* minimum only. The question asks for the *angular distance between* the first two minima. Mistaking this for the final answer is a common error.\n\n*   **Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Angular Distance**\nThe final step is to calculate the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`).\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 7: Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`. Comparing this value to the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.500 λ / c\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value is best matched by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry**\nThe problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. When the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), a regular polygon approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem, which is the perpendicular distance from the center to a side, becomes the radius of this limiting circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to analyzing the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Recall Fraunhofer Diffraction for a Circular Aperture**\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a far-field diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The intensity minima (dark rings) occur at specific angles determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Angular Positions of the Minima**\nThe condition for the m-th intensity minimum is given by the equation:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-trivial zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`). The formula becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Positions of the First Two Minima**\nTo find the angular positions, we need the values of the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`) and the second minimum (`θ₂`):\n*   `θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ [1.1166 * (λ / a)] - [0.6098 * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 6: Compare with Options and Identify Careful Points**\nThe calculated value `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)` is compared with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value is most accurately represented by option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Apothem vs. Radius**: It is crucial to correctly identify that for an N-sided polygon where N → ∞, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the resulting circular aperture.\n2.  **Question's Goal**: The question asks for the *distance between* the first two minima (`θ₂ - θ₁`), not the position of the first minimum (`θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a`, which is option D) or the angular diameter of the central Airy disk (`2θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ / a`, which is option B). These are common distractors.\n3.  **Precision**: Using the direct zeros of the Bessel function (`z₁` and `z₂`) provides a more accurate result than using the commonly rounded coefficients (1.22 and 2.23) which are derived from these zeros. The calculation `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)` yields approximately 0.5067, confirming that 0.506 is the correct choice.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the overwhelming consensus from the provided answers and the step-by-step derivation points to a single numerical result.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Aperture Shape**\nThe problem states that the aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and N is infinitely large. As the number of sides of a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches infinity, the polygon's shape converges to that of a circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Physics of Diffraction from a Circular Aperture**\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern.

This is a common distracter.\n*   **Careful Point 2**: Option C, `1.220 λ / a`, corresponds to the angular *diameter* of the central bright disk (`2 * θ₁`). This is also a common distracter.\n*   **Careful Point 3**: The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at a value of approximately 0.506 or 0.507.

A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides approaches the shape of a circle. The problem also specifies that the apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) is constant and has a length 'a'. As N approaches infinity, the apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the limiting circle.

Analyze the Aperture's Geometry**\n\nThe problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. As the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), a regular polygon approaches the shape of a circle.

As the number of sides of a regular polygon approaches infinity, its shape approaches a circle. The apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Recall Fraunhofer Diffraction for a Circular Aperture**\nThe far-field diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima**\nThe condition for the m-th intensity minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nwhere:\n*   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-trivial zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula becomes:\n`(2π * a / λ) * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n**Step 4: Identify Careful Points and Common Mistakes**\n*   **Mistake 1: Confusing radius and diameter.** The standard formula for the first minimum is often written as `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D`, where D is the diameter (`D=2a`). This gives `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`.\n*   **Mistake 2: Answering with the position of the first minimum.** The question asks for the *angular distance between the first two minima* (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`), not just the position of the first one (`θ₁`). Option A, `0.610 λ / a`, corresponds to `θ₁` and is a common distractor.\n*   **Mistake 3: Answering with the width of the central maximum.** The angular diameter of the central bright disk is `2 * θ₁ ≈ 1.220 * λ / a`. This corresponds to option D and is also a distractor.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance**\nTo find the angular distance `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`, we need the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x):\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we calculate `Δθ`:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\nSubstitute the numerical values:\n`Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 6: Compare with Options**\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * λ / a`. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a  (Position of the 1st minimum)\nB) 0.506 λ / a  (Matches our calculation)\nC) 0.500 λ / a  (A less precise approximation)\nD) 1.220 λ /a  (Angular diameter of the central maximum)\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067` is best represented by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Shape**: The problem describes an N-sided polygon where N is infinitely large. A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle. The apothem, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the aperture is a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diffraction Phenomenon**: When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima**: The dark rings, or intensity minima, occur at specific angles determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is when the argument of this function is a non-trivial zero.\n\n4.  **State the Formula for Minima**: The angular position, θ, of the m-th minimum is given by the formula:\n    `sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (π * D)`\n    where `λ` is the wavelength, `D` is the diameter of the aperture, and `z_m` is the m-th zero of the J₁ Bessel function.\n    Given that the radius is 'a', the diameter `D = 2a`. The problem also allows for the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula thus becomes:\n    `θ_m = z_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function**: To find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-trivial zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function. These values are approximately:\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Positions**:\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\n        `θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\n        `θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)` is best matched by the option `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Aperture Geometry**: It is crucial to correctly identify that the N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of **radius 'a'**, not diameter 'a'.\n*   **Question's Requirement**: The question asks for the *angular distance between the first two minima* (`θ₂ - θ₁`). It is a common mistake to provide the position of the first minimum (`θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ/a`) or the angular diameter of the central Airy disk (`2θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ/a`).\n*   **Bessel Function Zeros**: The calculation relies on the specific numerical values of the zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function. Using common approximations for the minima coefficients (like 1.22 and 2.23 for λ/D) can lead to small rounding errors but yields the same result. The most precise method, as performed above, uses the zeros directly.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the underlying physics problem leads to the following step-by-step derivation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry**: The problem starts with an N-sided regular polygon where the apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) is a constant length 'a'. As the number of sides N approaches infinity (N → ∞), the polygon converges to the shape of a circle. In this limit, the constant apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to analyzing the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon**: The light falling on this aperture undergoes Fraunhofer diffraction, which is observed in the far-field region. For a circular aperture, this specific diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima**: The angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`. The intensity becomes zero when the argument `x` of the function `J₁(x)` is a non-trivial zero. The argument is given by `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, where `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Angular Positions**: The condition for the m-th minimum is `k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`, where `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of `J₁(x)`. Using the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`) and substituting `k = 2π/λ`, we get:\n    `(2π/λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n    `θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Use Numerical Values for Zeros**: To find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`:\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    Substituting the numerical values:\n    `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 0.500 λ / a\n    *   B) 0.506 λ / a\n    *   C) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   D) 1.220 λ /a\n\n    The calculated value is best matched by option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Aperture Shape**: The crucial first step is realizing that the N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a'.\n*   **The Specific Question**: It is essential to calculate the *distance between* the first two minima (`θ₂ - θ₁`), not just the position of the first minimum (`θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a`, which is option C) or the angular diameter of the central Airy disk (`2θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ / a`, which is option D).\n*   **Radius vs. Diameter**: Many diffraction formulas use the diameter `D`. Since the radius is 'a', the diameter is `D = 2a`. Care must be taken to use the correct variable in the formulas. The direct calculation using the zeros of the Bessel function and the radius 'a' is the most straightforward approach.\n*   **Precision**: Using the common approximations for the first minimum (`1.22 λ/D`) and second minimum (`2.23 λ/D`) yields `Δθ = (1.115 - 0.610) λ/a = 0.505 λ/a`. Using the more precise values of the Bessel function zeros gives `0.5067 λ/a`, which confirms that `0.506 λ/a` is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Shape**: The problem states the aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and N is infinitely large. As the number of sides of a regular polygon approaches infinity, its shape approaches that of a circle.

A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides approaches the shape of a circle. The problem specifies that the apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) is constant and has a length 'a'. As N approaches infinity, this apothem becomes the radius of the limiting circle. Therefore, the aperture can be treated as a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Principle**: The problem describes monochromatic light passing through an aperture and creating an intensity pattern in the \"far field region\". This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima**: The Airy pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n    where:\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n    *   `z_m` is the m-th non-trivial zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation**: The problem allows for the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The formula becomes:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n    `θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Positions of the First Two Minima**: To find the angular distance between the first two minima, we first need their individual positions. This requires the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x):\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    The angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`) is:\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n    The angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`) is:\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value is approximately `0.5068 * (λ / a)`. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) 0.506 λ / a\n    *   B) 0.500 λ / a\n    *   C) 1.220 λ /a\n    *   D) 0.610 λ / a\n\n    The calculated value `0.5068 * (λ / a)` is best matched by option A.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Question's Goal**: It is crucial to note the question asks for the *distance between* the first two minima (`θ₂ - θ₁`), not just the position of the first minimum (`θ₁`). Calculating only `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a` would incorrectly lead to option D.\n*   **Radius vs. Diameter**: The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circular aperture. Many standard formulas for the first minimum use the diameter `D` (e.g., `θ₁ = 1.22 λ / D`). Since `D = 2a`, this gives `θ₁ = 1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a`, which is consistent with our more precise calculation.\n*   **Bessel Function Zeros**: The positions of the minima are not simple integer multiples. They are determined by the specific, non-uniformly spaced zeros of the Bessel function. Using the precise values for these zeros is necessary for an accurate answer.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the provided candidate answers, after correcting for inconsistencies in option labeling, is a numerical result of approximately 0.5067. This points directly to the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including a list of careful points to consider.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture**\nThe problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. The key is to understand what happens in the limit as N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n*   **Careful Point:** As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases to infinity, the polygon approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem 'a' (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) becomes the radius of this limiting circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Theory of Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a far-field diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n*   **Careful Point:** The angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are not given by a simple integer relationship like in a single-slit diffraction but are determined by the zeros of a special function.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Correct Formula for Minima**\nThe intensity `I(θ)` of the Airy pattern is given by `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin θ) / (k * a * sin θ)]²`, where `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, and 'a' is the radius of the aperture.\nThe intensity minima occur where `J₁(k * a * sin θ) = 0`. Let `z_m` be the m-th non-trivial zero of the function `J₁(x)`.\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`) and substituting `k = 2π/λ`, we get:\n`(2πa/λ) * θ_m = z_m`\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n`θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2πa)`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the correct formula relating the angle `θ` to the zeros of the Bessel function and the aperture *radius* 'a', not the diameter. Many textbooks use the diameter `D=2a`, which changes the formula to `θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (πD)`. Using 'a' consistently is key.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function**\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the values of the first two non-trivial zeros of `J₁(x)`.\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\nUsing the formula from Step 3:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2πa) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)`\n\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2πa) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to stop at the calculation of `θ₁`. Note that `0.6098 * (λ/a)` is very close to option A, `0.610 λ / a`. This is a classic distracter, representing the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance `Δθ` between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a)`\n\n**Step 7: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\nThe calculated value is `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a)`.

A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle. The apothem, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the aperture is a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diffraction Phenomenon**: When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima**: The dark rings, or intensity minima, occur at specific angles determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is when the argument of this function is a non-trivial zero.\n\n4.  **State the Formula for Minima**: The angular position, θ, of the m-th minimum is given by the formula:\n    `sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (π * D)`\n    where `λ` is the wavelength, `D` is the diameter of the aperture, and `z_m` is the m-th zero of the J₁ Bessel function.\n    Given that the radius is 'a', the diameter `D = 2a`. The problem also allows for the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula thus becomes:\n    `θ_m = z_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function**: To find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-trivial zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function.

The intensity becomes zero when the argument `x` of the function `J₁(x)` is a non-trivial zero. The argument is given by `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, where `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Angular Positions**: The condition for the m-th minimum is `k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`, where `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of `J₁(x)`. Using the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`) and substituting `k = 2π/λ`, we get:\n    `(2π/λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_m` gives:\n    `θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Use Numerical Values for Zeros**: To find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`:\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    Substituting the numerical values:\n    `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5067 * (λ / a)`.

Since the radius is 'a', the diameter is `D = 2a`. Care must be taken to use the correct variable in the formulas. The direct calculation using the zeros of the Bessel function and the radius 'a' is the most straightforward approach.\n*   **Precision**: Using the common approximations for the first minimum (`1.22 λ/D`) and second minimum (`2.23 λ/D`) yields `Δθ = (1.115 - 0.610) λ/a = 0.505 λ/a`. Using the more precise values of the Bessel function zeros gives `0.5067 λ/a`, which confirms that `0.506 λ/a` is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Shape**: The problem states the aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and N is infinitely large. As the number of sides of a regular polygon approaches infinity, its shape approaches that of a circle. The apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the aperture can be treated as a circular aperture of radius **r = a**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon**: The problem describes monochromatic light falling on an aperture and creating an intensity pattern in the \"far field region.\" This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima**: The intensity minima (dark rings) in an Airy pattern occur at specific angles determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n    where:\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n    *   `z_m` is the m-th non-trivial zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation**: The problem allows for the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`.

This is a common point of error.\n*   **Bessel Function Zeros**: The calculation relies on the specific, non-integer values of the zeros of the Bessel function, not simple integers. Using the common approximations `1.22 λ/D` and `2.23 λ/D` (where D=2a is the diameter) also leads to the correct result: `Δθ ≈ (1.115 - 0.610) * λ/a = 0.505 * λ/a`, which is still closest to 0.506.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly is that the result is approximately `0.506 * λ / a`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Aperture's Geometry**\nThe problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon where N is infinitely large. A crucial detail is that the apothem, which is the perpendicular distance from the center to a side, is constant and has a length 'a'. As the number of sides N of a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches infinity, the polygon's shape converges to that of a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this limiting circle.

The key is to understand what happens in the limit as N becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n*   **Careful Point:** As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases to infinity, the polygon approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem 'a' (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) becomes the radius of this limiting circle.
