Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This implies their rest-mass energies are in the same ratio: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substituting this relationship into the sum: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for the individual rest-mass energies gives:\n        *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n        *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    *   By the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final total energy. The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is released as kinetic energy (`Q`).\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum dictates that the two fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂`).\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n    *   This gives the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which means `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Therefore, `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁:**\n    *   Momentum is also conserved in relativistic mechanics, so `p₁ = p₂`.\n    *   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, we can set the expressions for each fragment equal to each other:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. Simplifying the equation:\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value:\n        `Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n        `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct Formulas:** It is crucial to use the correct formulas for kinetic energy in both the classical (`T = p²/2m`) and relativistic (`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`) contexts.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the conservation of both energy and momentum. The initial state (nucleus at rest) is key to determining the total kinetic energy and the relationship between the fragments' momenta.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The algebraic manipulation to solve for the relativistic kinetic energy `T₁` is the most complex part of the problem and must be done carefully. The analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the result of this calculation.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The problem gives data in GeV, but the options are in MeV. The final conversion step is essential.\n*   **Answer Matching:** A review of the candidate answers reveals that while most agents performed the calculation correctly to arrive at 5 MeV, many failed to select the corresponding option `B`. This highlights the importance of the final step of matching the calculated result to the given choices.\n\nThe correct difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the calculation methodology and the numerical result, even though several candidates selected the incorrect final letter option. The correct derivation is consistently shown to yield a difference of 5 MeV.\n\nHere is a step-by-step verification of the correct solution:\n\n**1. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial energy: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Given the mass relationship `m₁ = 2m₂`, their rest-mass energies are also in this ratio: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   Solving this system of equations:\n    *   `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n    *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment)\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n*   The energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n*   By conservation of momentum, the fragments have equal and opposite momenta (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 99/198 = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, which gives `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n*   Momentum is also conserved relativistically (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum and kinetic energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`:\n    *   `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    *   `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out:\n    *   `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    *   `600T₁ = 603`\n    *   `T₁_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Final Difference Calculation**\n*   The difference is `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Converting to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Formulas:** The distinction between the classical (`T = p²/2m`) and relativistic (`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`) energy-momentum relationships is critical.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies on the correct application of both energy and momentum conservation.\n*   **Algebra:** The algebraic simplification of the relativistic equation is a key step where errors could occur, but the provided solutions perform it correctly.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The final step requires converting the result from GeV to MeV.\n*   **Answer Selection:** The most common error among the candidate answers was not in the calculation itself, but in matching the correct numerical result (5 MeV) to the corresponding letter option (C).\n\nThe correct difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the difference in the kinetic energy of a fission fragment when calculated using relativistic mechanics versus classical mechanics. This requires a systematic application of conservation laws and the correct energy-momentum formulas for each regime.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   We are given two conditions for the fragment masses `m1` and `m2`:\n        1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (where `m1` is the more massive fragment).\n        2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   Substituting the first condition into the second: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99*M`, which gives `3*m2 = 0.99*M`, so `m2 = 0.33*M`.\n    *   It follows that `m1 = 2 * (0.33*M) = 0.66*M`.\n    *   Now, we find their rest-mass energies:\n        *   `m1*c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n        *   `m2*c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    *   The energy released is the mass that was \"lost\" and converted to kinetic energy.\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n    *   `Q = Mc² - (m1*c² + m2*c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   The initial nucleus is at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   The ratio of kinetic energies is `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p² / 2m1) / (p² / 2m2) = m2 / m1`.\n    *   `T1_cl / T2_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV` -> `3*T1_cl = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1:**\n    *   Momentum is still conserved: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n    *   The relativistic relationship between momentum and kinetic energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, we can set the expressions for each fragment equal:\n        `T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values: `m1*c² = 198 GeV`, `m2*c² = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n        `T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n        `T1² + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1²) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1²` terms on both sides cancel out.\n        `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   Combine the `T1` terms:\n        `600*T1 = 603`\n        `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    *   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n        `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation is robust across the majority of the provided answers, and my own verification confirms the result. The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is 5 MeV. Several of the provided answers contain the correct calculation but select the wrong final letter.

Deconstruct the Problem and Extract Key Information**\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It fissions into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2` (where `m1` is the more massive fragment).\n*   Sum of final rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   The goal is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1`, and the value calculated using the classical approximation, `T1_classical`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\nThis step is fundamental and performed consistently across all detailed solutions.\n*   From `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` and `m1 = 2 * m2`, we can substitute to find the individual masses in terms of `M`.\n    *   `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   `3*m2 = 0.99 * M` => `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`\n*   Now, convert these to rest-mass energies using `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released is the mass that was \"lost\" during the fission, converted into kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial rest-mass energy) - (Final sum of rest-mass energies)`\n*   `Q = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T_classical = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of masses:\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2m1) / (p^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5.

Since `E = T + mc^2`, this can be rewritten as `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)^2` for both fragments:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Simplify the equation:\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n*   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**7. Convert to MeV**\n*   Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers**\nAll agents that performed a detailed calculation arrived at the correct numerical result of 5 MeV.

We can solve this to find their rest-mass energies.\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M  =>  m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2m₂ = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, convert these masses to their corresponding rest-mass energies using `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 × (Mc²) = 0.66 × 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 × (Mc²) = 0.33 × 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission is the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)`\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us the relation `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   We can express the momentum term `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy `T` (where `E = T + mc²`):\n    `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now, substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation, and convert it to MeV.\n*   `Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Converting to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct steps from the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1.

Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll denote the more massive fragment as `m1`, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1`, and its classically calculated value, `T1_classical`.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for the masses in terms of `M` and then find their rest-mass energies.\n\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now, find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n3.  Calculate their rest-mass energies using the initial value `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial rest energy) - (Final total rest energy)`\n*   `Q = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This gives the relationship `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2 = p` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`. Since total energy `E = T + mc^2`, this becomes `(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Simplify the equation:\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 6: Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation and convert it to the required units.\n\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"2 times more massive\"**: The standard interpretation `m1 = 2*m2` was used, which is consistent among all successful solution paths and leads to a valid answer choice.\n2.  **Conservation Laws**: Both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are critical. For the relativistic case, it's the conservation of total energy (rest + kinetic) that is used to find the total kinetic energy released.\n3.  **Formulas**: The distinction between the classical `T = p^2/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)` is the core of the problem.\n4.  **Algebra**: The algebraic steps to solve for the relativistic kinetic energy `T1` must be performed carefully. The result is confirmed by multiple agents using two different but equivalent methods.\n5.  **Units**: The final answer must be converted from GeV to MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis, the calculation is robust and consistently yields the same result.\n\n1.  **Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:** The more massive fragment (`m₁`) has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV, and the less massive (`m₂`) has 99 GeV.\n2.  **Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The energy released is `300 GeV - (198 + 99) GeV = 3 GeV`.\n3.  **Classical T₁:** Using `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 1/2` and `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`, the classical kinetic energy `T₁_classical` is 1 GeV.\n4.  **Relativistic T₁:** Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, the correct kinetic energy `T₁_correct` is 1.005 GeV.\n5.  **Difference:** The difference is `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n6.  **Conversion:** `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.

Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   **Given Relationships:**\n        *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll define `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n        *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    *   We have a system of two equations. First, convert the mass relationship to rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-mass energies is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (Mc^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute the first relation into the sum: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This simplifies to `3 * (m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for the rest-mass energies gives:\n        *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment).\n        *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    *   By conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energies plus the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (`Q`) is the mass defect: `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the initial momentum (zero) must equal the total final momentum.

Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This implies their rest-mass energies are in the same ratio: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substituting this relationship into the sum: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for the individual rest-mass energies gives:\n        *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n        *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    *   By the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final total energy. The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is released as kinetic energy (`Q`).\n    *   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the law of conservation of momentum dictates that the two fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂`).\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n    *   This gives the relationship `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which means `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Therefore, `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁:**\n    *   Momentum is also conserved in relativistic mechanics, so `p₁ = p₂`.\n    *   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, we can set the expressions for each fragment equal to each other:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. Simplifying the equation:\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value:\n        `Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n        `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct Formulas:** It is crucial to use the correct formulas for kinetic energy in both the classical (`T = p²/2m`) and relativistic (`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`) contexts.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the conservation of both energy and momentum. The initial state (nucleus at rest) is key to determining the total kinetic energy and the relationship between the fragments' momenta.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The algebraic manipulation to solve for the relativistic kinetic energy `T₁` is the most complex part of the problem and must be done carefully. The analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the result of this calculation.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The problem gives data in GeV, but the options are in MeV. The final conversion step is essential.\n*   **Answer Matching:** A review of the candidate answers reveals that while most agents performed the calculation correctly to arrive at 5 MeV, many failed to select the corresponding option `B`. This highlights the importance of the final step of matching the calculated result to the given choices.\n\nThe correct difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the calculation methodology and the numerical result, even though several candidates selected the incorrect final letter option.

Therefore, `T₂ = 2T₁`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV`, which gives `3T₁ = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4.

We are given `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T₁`, and the value calculated using the classical approximation, `T₁_classical`.\n\n### **2.

This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`): `m₁ = 2m₂`.

Simplifying the equation:\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This calculation is also performed correctly and consistently in the candidate answers.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value:\n        `Difference = T₁ - T₁_cl = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert the result to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n*   **Calculation:** The step-by-step calculation is robust and consistently yields a result of 5 MeV across nearly all provided answers that show their work.\n*   **Formulas:** The correct classical and relativistic formulas were used.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The principles of conservation of energy and momentum were applied correctly.\n*   **Answer Matching:** The options are A) 2 MeV, B) 10 MeV, C) 20 MeV, and D) 5 MeV.

The calculation is robust and the result is clear.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the provided solutions.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the System and Extract Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll denote the more massive fragment as `m1`, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1`, and its classically calculated value, `T1_classical`.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for the masses in terms of `M` and then find their rest-mass energies.\n\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n2.  Now, find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n3.  Calculate their rest-mass energies using the initial value `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released from the mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial rest energy) - (Final total rest energy)`\n*   `Q = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This gives the relationship `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p1 = p2 = p` still holds.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   We can express the momentum term as `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`. Since total energy `E = T + mc^2`, this becomes `(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Simplify the equation:\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 6: Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation and convert it to the required units.\n\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"2 times more massive\"**: The standard interpretation `m1 = 2*m2` was used, which is consistent among all successful solution paths and leads to a valid answer choice.\n2.  **Conservation Laws**: Both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are critical. For the relativistic case, it's the conservation of total energy (rest + kinetic) that is used to find the total kinetic energy released.\n3.  **Formulas**: The distinction between the classical `T = p^2/(2m)` and the relativistic `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)` is the core of the problem.\n4.  **Algebra**: The algebraic steps to solve for the relativistic kinetic energy `T1` must be performed carefully. The result is confirmed by multiple agents using two different but equivalent methods.\n5.  **Units**: The final answer must be converted from GeV to MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis, the calculation is robust and consistently yields the same result.\n\n1.  **Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:** The more massive fragment (`m₁`) has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV, and the less massive (`m₂`) has 99 GeV.\n2.  **Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The energy released is `300 GeV - (198 + 99) GeV = 3 GeV`.\n3.  **Classical T₁:** Using `T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁ = 1/2` and `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`, the classical kinetic energy `T₁_classical` is 1 GeV.\n4.  **Relativistic T₁:** Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, the correct kinetic energy `T₁_correct` is 1.005 GeV.\n5.  **Difference:** The difference is `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n6.  **Conversion:** `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.

The final conversion (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`) is a necessary last step.\n*   **Matching Answer to Option:** The calculated result is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option B. Several candidate answers correctly calculated 5 MeV but then incorrectly selected option A or C, indicating a failure in the final matching step.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step analysis confirms that the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy `T₁` and the classically calculated `T₁` is 5 MeV. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully executed the plan to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the more massive fission fragment.\n\n*   **Fragment Energies:** The rest-mass energies of the massive and lighter fragments were calculated to be 198.0 GeV and 99.0 GeV, respectively.\n*   **Kinetic Energy Released:** The total kinetic energy released in the fission (Q-value) was found to be 3.0 GeV.\n*   **Classical Calculation:** The kinetic energy of the massive fragment, calculated using the classical approximation, was 1.000 GeV.\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The correct kinetic energy, calculated using relativistic formulas, was 1.005 GeV.\n*   **Final Difference:** The difference between the two values is 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV. Converting this to MeV gives 5.0 MeV.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the provided answers and identifying the key points for a correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    *   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice as massive as the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This implies their rest-mass energies are in the same ratio: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Solving this system of two equations:\n        *   `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        *   `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment)\n        *   `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment)\n    This step was performed correctly in all candidate answers that showed their work.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    *   By conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energies plus the kinetic energies of the fragments (`T₁` and `T₂`).\n    *   The total kinetic energy released is the mass defect: `Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    This step was also consistently calculated correctly.\n\n3.  **Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   By conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`p₁ = p₂`).\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n    *   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n    *   This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which means `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n    This classical approximation was calculated correctly in all relevant candidate answers.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁:**\n    *   Momentum is also conserved in the relativistic case (`p₁ = p₂`).\n    *   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and kinetic energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for both fragments:\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n        `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    *   The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplifying the equation gives:\n        `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n        `600T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n    This relativistic calculation, which is the most complex step, was also performed correctly in nearly all candidate answers.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is `ΔT₁ = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n    *   `ΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Converting to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV): `ΔT₁ = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** The overwhelming majority of the provided answers correctly perform the physics calculations, consistently arriving at a difference of 5 MeV.\n*   **Formula Application:** The distinction and correct application of both classical and relativistic formulas for kinetic energy are essential and were handled correctly.\n*   **Final Answer Mapping:** A significant number of the candidate answers, despite correctly calculating the value of 5 MeV, selected the wrong multiple-choice option (e.g., choosing C for 10 MeV or A for 2 MeV). This appears to be a common error in the final step of their reasoning.\n*   **Correct Option:** The calculated difference is exactly 5 MeV, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBased on a thorough review of the physics and the calculations presented, the correct difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided answers and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Define State Properties:**\n    *   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   **Given Relationships:**\n        *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll define `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n        *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    *   We have a system of two equations. First, convert the mass relationship to rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-mass energies is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (Mc^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substitute the first relation into the sum: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This simplifies to `3 * (m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for the rest-mass energies gives:\n        *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV` (less massive fragment).\n        *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (more massive fragment).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    *   By conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energies plus the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (`Q`) is the mass defect: `Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:**\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the initial momentum (zero) must equal the total final momentum. This means the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2m1) / (p^2 / 2m2) = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting gives `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`, which means `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1:**\n    *   Momentum is still conserved (`|p1| = |p2| = p`), but we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n    *   This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy (`T = E - mc^2`) as `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`.\n    *   Since the momenta are equal, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)^2` for both fragments:\n        `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n    *   Substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n        `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Simplify the equation:\n        `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n        `600*T1 = 603`\n        `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   The difference is `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n        `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Correct Formulas:** It is essential to use the correct formulas for kinetic energy in both the classical (`T = p^2 / 2m`) and relativistic (`(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`) regimes.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the conservation of both energy and momentum.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy:** The relativistic calculation involves expanding and solving a linear equation (after the quadratic terms cancel). Care must be taken to avoid algebraic errors.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The problem is stated in GeV, but the answers are in MeV. The final conversion is a critical step.\n*   **Answer Mapping:** After calculating the final value (5 MeV), it must be correctly matched to the given options: A) 10 MeV, B) 5 MeV, C) 2 MeV, D) 20 MeV. The correct option is B. Many of the provided candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final mapping step.\n\nThe final calculated difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
