    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup and Reactions**\n\n*   **Initial Mixture:** We start with an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighing 7.20 g. \"Equimolar\" means that the number of moles of salt A is equal to the number of moles of salt B. Let's call this number of moles 'n'.\n*   **Heating:** The mixture is heated to 200°C and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n*   **Gas Analysis:** The gas mixture is passed through three tubes in sequence to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant (drying agent) that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ or other acidic gases were produced. This tells us the original salts were not carbonates.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that passed through all three tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper, indicating it is likely a relatively inert gas like nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Product Gas**\n\nWe can use the data from the tubes to find the number of moles of each gas produced in the decomposition. We will use the molar masses: H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol, O₂ = 32.0 g/mol, and the molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 1.008 * 2 + 16.00  # g/mol\nM_O2 = 16.00 * 2         # g/mol\n\n# Molar volume at STP\nV_m_STP = 22.4           # L/mol\n\n# Given data\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O2 = 0.80   # g\nvolume_C_STP = 2.24  # L\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\nmoles_C = volume_C_STP / V_m_STP\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O = {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of O2 = {moles_O2:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of Gas C = {moles_C:.4f} mol\")\n```\n>>>\nMoles of H2O = 0.1998 mol\nMoles of O2 = 0.0250 mol\nMoles of Gas C = 0.1000 mol\n>>>\nFrom the calculations, we have approximately:\n*   Moles of H₂O ≈ 0.200 mol\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol\n*   Moles of Gas C = 0.100 mol\n\n**3. Identify the Original Salts (A and B)**\n\n*   The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂ (our hypothesis for Gas C).\n*   Since the salts were heated *without air*, all the atoms (H, O, N) must have come from the salts themselves.\n*   Salts containing only nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen are typically ammonium salts of nitrogen's oxyacids. The most common ones are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   Let's check their decomposition reactions:\n    *   **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   **Ammonium nitrate:** At high temperatures (like 200°C), one of its decomposition pathways is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). This reaction is crucial because it is the only one of the common decompositions that produces O₂, which we know was formed.\n\nThis strongly suggests that salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry**\n\nLet's assume our salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ and the initial amount of each is 'n' moles.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nn NH₄NO₂ + n NH₄NO₃ → Products\n\nLet's look at the products from each reaction:\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio, which is 1:1:0.5:2 per mole of NH₄NO₃): `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = **4n**\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃) = **0.5n**\n*   **Total Moles of N₂ (Gas C):** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = **2n**\n\nWe can solve for 'n' using our calculated moles of products from step 2:\n*   Using O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   Using N₂: 2n = 0.100 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n*   Using H₂O: 4n = 0.200 mol  =>  n = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations give a consistent value of **n = 0.05 mol**. This confirms our hypothesis about the identity of the salts and their reaction pathways.\n\n**5. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the given total mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) ≈ 64.05 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) ≈ 80.05 g/mol\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.05 g/mol)\n*   Total Mass = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = 7.205 g\n\nThis matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g. Our model is correct.\n\n**6. Find the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8**\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9**\n\n**Total number of atoms in salts A and B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",

The weight increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts like carbonates.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen gas that reacted.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that passed through all tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product:**\n    *   We use the molar masses (H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol, O₂ = 32.0 g/mol) and the molar volume of a gas at STP (22.4 L/mol).\n\n    ```python\n    # Molar masses\n    M_H2O = 18.016  # g/mol\n    M_O2 = 32.00   # g/mol\n\n    # Molar volume at STP\n    V_m_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n    # Experimental data\n    mass_H2O = 3.60  # g\n    mass_O2 = 0.80   # g\n    volume_C = 2.24  # L\n\n    # Calculate moles\n    moles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\n    moles_O2 = mass_O2 / M_O2\n    moles_C = volume_C / V_m_STP\n\n    print(f\"Moles of H2O produced: {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\n    print(f\"Moles of O2 produced: {moles_O2:.4f} mol\")\n    print(f\"Moles of Gas C produced: {moles_C:.4f} mol\")\n    ```\n>>>\nMoles of H2O produced: 0.1998 mol\nMoles of O2 produced: 0.0250 mol\nMoles of Gas C produced: 0.1000 mol\n>>>\nFrom the calculations, the number of moles of each product is:\n*   moles(H₂O) ≈ 0.20 mol\n*   moles(O₂) = 0.025 mol\n*   moles(Gas C) = 0.10 mol\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition produced H₂O, O₂, and Gas C. Since the reaction was done without air, the elements H, O, and the elements in Gas C must have come from the salts.\n    *   Gas C is inert to water, limewater, and hot copper, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   Therefore, the salts A and B are composed of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. The most common salts fitting this description that decompose upon heating are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's check their decomposition reactions:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n        *   **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O** (This reaction occurs at temperatures around 200°C and is crucial as it's the source of the O₂ detected).\n\n4.  **Verify the Hypothesis using Stoichiometry:**\n    *   Let's assume A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃. The initial mixture is equimolar, so let the number of moles of each salt be 'n'.\n    *   **From n mol of NH₄NO₂:** we get n mol of N₂ and 2n mol of H₂O.\n    *   **From n mol of NH₄NO₃:** we get n mol of N₂, 0.5n mol of O₂, and 2n mol of H₂O.\n    *   **Total moles of products:**\n        *   Total N₂ = n + n = **2n**\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 + 0.5n = **0.5n**\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n    *   Now we use our calculated moles of products to find 'n':\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n        *   From N₂ (Gas C): 2n = 0.10 mol => **n = 0.05 mol**\n        *   From H₂O: 4n ≈ 0.20 mol  => **n ≈ 0.05 mol**\n    *   All calculations yield a consistent value of n = 0.05 mol, confirming our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Verify the Initial Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) ≈ 64.05 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.008) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) ≈ 80.05 g/mol\n    *   Total mass = (mass of NH₄NO₂) + (mass of NH₄NO₃)\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol)\n    *   Total mass = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = **7.205 g**\n    *   This is in excellent agreement with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
