    "This problem is governed by the energy-time formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Principle:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which in this case is the lifetime (τ) of the quantum state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n2.  **Interpreting \"Lifetime\":** The finite lifetime of a quantum state means that its energy is not a perfectly sharp value. Instead, the energy level is \"broadened\" or \"smeared out.\" The amount of this broadening is the energy uncertainty, ΔE. So, to solve the problem, we must first calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Energy Width (ΔE) for Each State:**\n    *   We can approximate the relationship as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   **For the first state (State 1):**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ sec\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **For the second state (State 2):**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ sec\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n4.  **Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels (or spectral lines) to be clearly resolved, the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than their energy widths. A conservative criterion is that the energy difference must be at least as large as the sum of their individual widths.\n    *   Required energy difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Sum of widths = (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    Even using a less strict criterion where the separation must only be larger than the broader of the two widths (ΔE₁), the required energy difference must be greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:** We are looking for an energy difference that is significantly larger than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (much smaller)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (much larger)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (smaller)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (much smaller)\n\n    Only option B provides an energy separation (10⁻⁴ eV) that is orders of magnitude larger than the natural energy broadening of the states. With this separation, the two energy levels would be easily and clearly distinguishable.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation with a Python script.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E * Delta_t >= h_bar / 2)\n# We use the approximate form Delta_E ~ h_bar / tau for the width\ndelta_e1 = h_bar / tau1\ndelta_e2 = h_bar / tau2\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the widths\ntotal_width = delta_e1 + delta_e2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_e1:.4g} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_e2:.4g} eV\")\nprint(f\"Sum of widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {total_width:.4g} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the energy widths.\")\nprint(f\"The minimum required separation is on the order of {total_width:.4g} eV.\")\n\n# Compare with the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > total_width:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1g} eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the total width.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1g} eV) is not a possible energy difference as it is smaller than or on the order of the energy widths.\")\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nSum of widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2): 7.24e-07 eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the energy widths.\nThe minimum required separation is on the order of 7.24e-07 eV.\n\nComparing with options:\nOption A (1e-11 eV) is not a possible energy difference as it is smaller than or on the order of the energy widths.\nOption B (1e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the total width.\nOption C (1e-08 eV) is not a possible energy difference as it is smaller than or on the order of the energy widths.\nOption D (1e-09 eV) is not a possible energy difference as it is smaller than or on the order of the energy widths.\n<<<B>>>",
