    "This is a problem about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential probability distribution. A key feature of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an event (decay) occurring in a future time interval is independent of how much time has already passed without the event occurring.\n\n**Step 1: Define the survival probability**\n\nLet P(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed after time t. This is also called the survival probability. The formula for this is:\nP(t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed within time t is:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Step 2: Use the given information to find a key parameter**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\n1 - P(100) = 0.32\nP(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nSo, the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes is 0.68.\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n**Step 3: State the question in terms of probability**\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nThis can be written as a conditional probability:\nP(decay between t=50 and t=200 | survived up to t=50)\n\n**Step 4: Apply the memoryless property**\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The problem simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom would decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the required probability**\n\nWe know from Step 2 that `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`. We need to find `e^(-λ * 150)`.\nWe can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` using the value we know:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value from Step 2:\nP(150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nThe probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The survival probability for 100 minutes is 0.68.\n# We need to find the decay probability for 150 minutes.\n# The survival probability for 150 minutes is (0.68)^1.5.\n# The decay probability is 1 - survival_probability.\n\nsurvival_prob_150 = 0.68**1.5\ndecay_prob_150 = 1 - survival_prob_150\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"The probability is: {decay_prob_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem describes a radioactive decay process, which is characterized by the exponential distribution. A key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The information that 50 minutes have passed without decay is therefore irrelevant to the future probability.\n\nWe need to calculate the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the decay constant (λ).**\nThe probability of decay within a time `t` is given by the formula:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nThis means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\nP_survival(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes.**\nBecause of the memoryless property, the question simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can find the value of e^(-λ * 150) from the value we found in Step 1:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nSubstitute the known value:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nUsing a calculator:\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\nP_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\n**Step 3: Convert the probability to a percentage.**\n0.4393 * 100% = 43.93%\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
