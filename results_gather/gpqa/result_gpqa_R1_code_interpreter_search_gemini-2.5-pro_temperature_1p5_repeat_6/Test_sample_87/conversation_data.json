    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on experimental observations. Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1.  **Antigen Administration:** Rotavirus proteins are delivered orally. This mimics a natural infection and targets the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n2.  **Immune Response Location:** The response is observed in Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, responsible for initiating immune responses against intestinal pathogens.\n3.  **Cell Population:** The cells of interest are a *proliferating* population. In an immune response, B cells and T cells proliferate upon encountering their specific antigen.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** Sequencing of the *variable heavy chain gene* from these proliferating cells shows *high variability*. The variable region of an antibody is what binds to the antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a humoral part of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in immune cells like B cells.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers (found in Peyer's patches). It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, switching the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function. However, it does not affect the *variable* region, which determines antigen specificity. The question explicitly states variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism by which the immune system adapts to a new foreign element. It occurs in activated B cells in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process, followed by selection for B cells with higher affinity for the antigen, is called affinity maturation. The observation of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of \"proliferating cells\" in the \"Peyer's patches\" is the classic description of somatic hypermutation.\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in developing B cells in the primary lymphoid organ (the bone marrow) *before* they ever encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure, in a population of cells that are already proliferating in response to that antigen. The variability seen is being actively generated during this response, not as part of the initial B cell development.\n\nTherefore, the process responsible for the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene during an active immune response in a secondary lymphoid organ is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
