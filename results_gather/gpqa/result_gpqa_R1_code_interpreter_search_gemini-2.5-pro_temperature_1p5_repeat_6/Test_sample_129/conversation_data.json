    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem involves the concept of cosmological redshift. As light from a distant object like a quasar travels through the expanding universe, its wavelength gets stretched. The amount of stretching is quantified by the redshift, 'z'. The formula that connects the rest wavelength (`λ_rest`) and the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) is:\n    `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Wavelengths:**\n    *   **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line:** This is a specific spectral line of hydrogen which is very prominent in astrophysics. Its rest wavelength (`λ_rest`) is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** The Earth's atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer, absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation. For ground-based optical telescopes to detect light, its wavelength must be long enough to pass through the atmosphere. This \"atmospheric window\" for optical light begins at around 3200-3500 Å (or 320-350 nm). Light with a shorter wavelength is blocked. Therefore, the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) must be greater than this cutoff value.\n\n3.  **Frame the Problem:** We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift (`z`) of an object so that its Lyα line can be detected by a ground-based telescope. This means we need to find the minimum `z` that will shift the 1216 Å line to at least the minimum wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere.\n\n4.  **Set up the Equation:** Let's set the observed Lyα wavelength equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (`λ_cutoff`) to find the minimum redshift (`z_min`).\n    `λ_cutoff = λ_rest * (1 + z_min)`\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `z_min`:\n    `1 + z_min = λ_cutoff / λ_rest`\n    `z_min = (λ_cutoff / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   `λ_rest` = 1216 Å\n    *   Let's use a typical value for the atmospheric cutoff, `λ_cutoff` ≈ 3500 Å. This is a common and reasonable estimate for where the atmosphere becomes transparent enough for astronomical observations.\n\n    Now, we can calculate `z_min` using a python script.\n    ```python\n    # Rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms\n    lambda_rest = 1216\n\n    # Approximate atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based optical telescopes in Angstroms\n    # A value around 3500 Angstroms is a common estimate for the start of the optical window.\n    lambda_cutoff = 3500\n\n    # Calculate the minimum redshift required\n    z_min = (lambda_cutoff / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n    print(z_min)\n    ```\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result:** The calculated `z_min` is approximately 1.878.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 1.2\n    *   B) 2.4\n    *   C) 1.9\n    *   D) 3.0\n\n    The calculated value of `z ≈ 1.88` is very close to option C, which is 1.9. This confirms that a redshift of about 1.9 is the minimum required to shift the 1216 Å Lyα line to an observable wavelength of ~3500 Å. Any redshift lower than this would result in the line falling into the UV range blocked by the atmosphere.\n\n<<<C>>>"
