    "An electron is in the spin state represented by the spinor `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`. We want to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, `⟨S_y⟩`.\n\n### 1. State the Formula\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a quantum state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`⟨A⟩ = (⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nIn our case, the operator is `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n\n### 2. Identify the Components\n\n*   **State vector (ket):** `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`\n*   **Conjugate transpose (bra):** `⟨ψ|` is found by taking the transpose of `|ψ⟩` and then the complex conjugate of its elements.\n    `|ψ⟩^T = [3i, 4]`\n    `⟨ψ| = [conj(3i), conj(4)] = [-3i, 4]`\n*   **Spin operator `S_y`:**\n    `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Denominator: `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\nThis term represents the squared norm of the state vector.\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Numerator: `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`\n\nFirst, let's find the result of applying the operator `S_y` to the state `|ψ⟩`.\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, 3i² ]^T`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T`\n\nNow, multiply this result by the bra `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( 12(-1) - 12 )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = -12ħ`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Expectation Value `⟨S_y⟩`\n\nNow, we divide the numerator by the denominator:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ/25`\n\nThis can also be written as `-12*hbar/25`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 25*hbar/2\nB) -12*hbar/25\nC) 12*hbar/25\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
