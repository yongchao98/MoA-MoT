    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle as the number of sides `N` approaches infinity. The radius of this circle will be equal to the apothem `a`.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `r = a`. The diameter of this aperture is `D = 2a`.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the intensity pattern.\n\nThe angular positions `\\(\\theta\\)` of these minima are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`. The condition for the n-th minimum is:\n\n`sin(\\theta_n) = (x_n / \\pi) * (\\lambda / D)`\n\nwhere:\n- `\\(\\lambda\\)` is the wavelength of the light.\n- `D` is the diameter of the aperture.\n- `\\(x_n\\)` is the n-th zero of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`.\n\nThe problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the small-angle approximation `sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta`. The formula becomes:\n\n`\\theta_n = (x_n / \\pi) * (\\lambda / D)`\n\nIn our case, the radius is `a`, so the diameter is `D = 2a`. Substituting this into the formula:\n\n`\\theta_n = (x_n / \\pi) * (\\lambda / (2a)) = (x_n / (2\\pi)) * (\\lambda / a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1`.\n\n`\\Delta\\theta = (x_2 / (2\\pi)) * (\\lambda / a) - (x_1 / (2\\pi)) * (\\lambda / a)`\n`\\Delta\\theta = ((x_2 - x_1) / (2\\pi)) * (\\lambda / a)`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we need the first two zeros of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`:\n- The first zero, `x_1 \\approx 3.8317`\n- The second zero, `x_2 \\approx 7.0156`\n\nNow, let's calculate the coefficient `(x_2 - x_1) / (2\\pi)`:\n\n`(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * \\pi) = 3.1839 / (2 * \\pi) \\approx 0.5067`\n\nSo, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n\n`\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.5067 * (\\lambda / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 `\\lambda / a`\nB) 0.500 `\\lambda / a`\nC) 0.506 `\\lambda / a`\nD) 1.220 `\\lambda / a`\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 \\lambda / a` matches option C.\n\nLet's double-check with a more precise calculation.\n```python\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Get the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = zeros[0]\nx2 = zeros[1]\n\n# The angular position of the nth minimum for a circular aperture of radius 'a' (diameter D=2a) is:\n# theta_n = (x_n / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a) for small angles.\n\n# The angular distance between the first and second minima is theta_2 - theta_1.\n# The coefficient for the angular distance is (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi).\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>0.5067\n\nThe code confirms that the coefficient is approximately 0.5067. This matches option C.\n\nFor context, let's analyze the other options:\n- Option A, `0.610 \\lambda / a`, corresponds to the angular position of the first minimum (`\\theta_1`), as `x_1 / (2\\pi) \\approx 3.8317 / (2\\pi) \\approx 0.610`.\n- Option D, `1.220 \\lambda / a`, corresponds to the angular width of the central maximum (`2\\theta_1`).\n\nThe question specifically asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima,\" which is `\\theta_2 - \\theta_1`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle as the number of sides `N` tends to infinity. The radius of this limiting circle is equal to the apothem, so the radius is `r = a`.\n\nThe problem is therefore equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`. The diameter of this aperture is `D = 2a`.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the intensity pattern.\n\nThe angular position `\\(\\theta\\)` of the minima is given by the formula:\n`sin(\\theta) = k \\frac{\\lambda}{D}`\nwhere `\\(\\lambda\\)` is the wavelength, `D` is the diameter of the aperture, and `k` is a numerical factor that depends on the order of the minimum and is related to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, `J_1`.\n\nFor small angles, we can use the approximation `sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta`, so the formula becomes:\n`\\theta_n = \\frac{x_n}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a}`\nwhere `x_n` is the n-th zero of the Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`.\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1`.\n\n`\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 = \\left( \\frac{x_2}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{x_1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\right)`\n`\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a}`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we need the first two zeros of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`:\n- The first zero, `x_1 \\approx 3.8317`\n- The second zero, `x_2 \\approx 7.0156`\n\nNow, let's calculate the coefficient `\\frac{x_2 - x_1}{2\\pi}`:\n`\\text{Coefficient} = \\frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{2 \\times 3.14159} = \\frac{3.1839}{6.28318} \\approx 0.5067`\n\nThis calculation was also verified by the python script which gave the output `0.5067`.\n\nSo, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately:\n`\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.5067 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) `0.610 \\lambda / a` (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum, `\\theta_1 = \\frac{x_1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\approx 0.610 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}`)\nB) `0.500 \\lambda / a`\nC) `0.506 \\lambda / a`\nD) `1.220 \\lambda / a` (This corresponds to the angular diameter of the central bright disk, `2\\theta_1`)\n\nOur calculated value of `0.5067 \\lambda / a` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
