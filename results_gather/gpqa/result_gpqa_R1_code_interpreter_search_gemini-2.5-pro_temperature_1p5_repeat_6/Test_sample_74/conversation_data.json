You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "*   **Analysis of the User's problem:** The user is attempting to overexpress a recombinant GADD45G protein in CHO cells. The protein is designed with an N-terminal HA tag for purification. The experiment fails, as the protein is not overexpressed. The key piece of information is the DNA sequence of the construct.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The problem likely lies within the provided DNA sequence, preventing the successful translation of the full-length protein. A common reason for such a failure is the unintended presence of a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Sequence Breakdown and Translation:**\n    1.  The sequence starts with `ATG`, which is the correct start codon for Methionine (M).\n    2.  The problem states an N-terminal HA tag was added. The amino acid sequence for the HA tag is `YPYDVPDYA`. Let's translate the beginning of the DNA sequence to verify this. The reading frame is set by the initial `ATG`.\n        *   DNA: 5'- `ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` ... -3'\n        *   Codons: `ATG` `TAC` `CCA` `TAC` `GAT` `GTT` `CCA` `GAT` `TAC` `GCC`\n        *   Amino Acids: `M`   `Y`   `P`   `Y`   `D`   `V`   `P`   `D`   `Y`   `A`\n        This confirms the start codon and the HA tag sequence are correctly encoded.\n\n    3.  Now, let's examine the sequence immediately following the HA tag to see if it correctly transitions into the GADD45G coding sequence.\n        *   Sequence after HA tag: `AAA TGA CTC...`\n        *   Translation: The next codon is `AAA`, which codes for Lysine (K).\n        *   The codon after `AAA` is `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon.\n\n*   **Conclusion from Sequence Analysis:** The ribosome will initiate translation at the `ATG` start codon, synthesize the Methionine and the 9-amino-acid HA tag, followed by a single Lysine. It will then encounter the `TGA` stop codon. This will signal the termination of translation, causing the ribosome to detach from the mRNA. The result is a tiny, non-functional peptide (MYPYDVPDYAK) just 11 amino acids long, instead of the full-length GADD45G fusion protein. This perfectly explains why the user is \"unable to overexpress\" the intended protein.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Options:**\n    *   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. As shown above, the DNA sequence correctly codes for the standard HA tag peptide (`YPYDVPDYA`).\n    *   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect and irrelevant. Firstly, the problematic codon is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Secondly, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation. The absence of a corresponding tRNA is why they function as stop codons.\n    *   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct conclusion. The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon forces the ribosome to stop translation long before the entire coding sequence for GADD45G has been read.\n    *   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** This is incorrect. While linkers can be important, their absence doesn't inherently cause proteolysis. The primary issue here is that the full-length protein is not being synthesized in the first place, so its degradation is not the root cause of the problem.\n\nThe evidence points unequivocally to a premature stop codon causing early termination of translation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
