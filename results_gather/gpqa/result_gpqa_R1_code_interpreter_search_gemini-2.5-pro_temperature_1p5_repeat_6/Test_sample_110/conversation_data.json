    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then act as a nucleophile and attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   **C6:** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms the enolate anion at the C6 position.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The enolate anion at C6 is the nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the carbon furthest from the ester group in the C=C double bond).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After the attack, the resulting enolate intermediate is protonated (e.g., by the conjugate acid of the base, t-butanol, or during workup) to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group and a methyl group attached to C6 of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   To name this product according to the options provided, we treat it as an ethyl propanoate derivative.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl ...propanoate`. The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, its attachment point (the original C6) is numbered as C1'. The numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group (the ketone's C=O group) the lowest possible number. This places the oxo group at C2'.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1' (the original C6-methyl).\n        *   An oxo group at C2' (the original carbonyl).\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3' (the original C2 substituents).\n    *   Thus, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nitronate):**\n    *   The protons on the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the NO₂ group) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates this α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion). `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. The resulting anion is then protonated by water.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   The product molecule is formed by connecting `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)–` to `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon becomes the parent chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon (C1):\n        `CN(1)–CH₂(2)–CH(CH₃)(3)–CH(NO₂)(4)–CH₂(5)–CH₃(6)`\n    *   The parent chain is six carbons long, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\nA) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\nB) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\nC) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\nD) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe correct combination of products is found in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
