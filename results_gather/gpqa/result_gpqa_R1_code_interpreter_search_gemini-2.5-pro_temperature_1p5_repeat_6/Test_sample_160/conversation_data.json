    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the two scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (determines λ1):** This involves the mean free path of gas molecules within the vacuum chamber before the electron beam is on. The particles colliding are the gas molecules themselves. They are all in random thermal motion.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (determines λ2):** This involves the mean free path of high-energy electrons from the electron beam as they travel through the remaining gas molecules. Here, the projectiles are electrons, and the targets are gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The general concept for the mean free path (λ) is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section (the effective area of the target for a collision).\n\n3.  **Calculate λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    When calculating the MFP of a gas molecule in a gas of its peers, all particles are moving. We need to consider their average *relative* velocity. This introduces a correction factor of `sqrt(2)` into the denominator of the standard MFP formula.\n    Therefore, the mean free path for the gas molecules is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)\n    where `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for two gas molecules.\n\n4.  **Calculate λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    When a beam of high-energy particles (electrons) is fired into a gas, the velocity of the electrons is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, meaning the electrons are highly relativistic (moving at over 90% the speed of light). In this case, the target gas molecules can be considered stationary.\n    Because the targets are stationary, the `sqrt(2)` correction factor is not used. The formula is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n6.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is the kinetic cross-section, determined by the effective size of the molecules and their short-range intermolecular (van der Waals) forces.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. A high-energy electron (1000 keV) is a tiny, fast-moving charged particle. To it, a neutral gas molecule is mostly empty space. Significant interaction (scattering) only occurs if the electron passes very close to the atomic nucleus or one of the atomic electrons. This means the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the high-energy electron is very small.\n    *   Therefore, it is physically certain that the electron-gas scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion on the Ratio:**\n    Since σ_gg / σ_eg >> 1, the ratio λ2 / λ1 becomes:\n    λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (a number much larger than 1)\n    This means λ2 / λ1 must be a value much larger than sqrt(2) (which is ≈ 1.414).\n\n    Even in the most conservative and simplified model where we might incorrectly assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg, we would get:\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.\n    So, λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect because our analysis shows λ2 > 1.414*λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect as the underlying physics is different.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is correct. Our result, λ2 > 1.414*λ1, satisfies this condition because 1.414 is greater than 1.22. This option correctly captures that the electron's mean free path is significantly longer.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect. It would imply that electrons collide more frequently than gas molecules, which contradicts the physics of high-energy particle interactions.\n\nThus, the electron beam travels a much longer average distance between collisions than the gas molecules do, meaning λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
