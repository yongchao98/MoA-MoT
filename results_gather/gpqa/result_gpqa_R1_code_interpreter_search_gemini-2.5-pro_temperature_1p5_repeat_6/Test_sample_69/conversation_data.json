    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given reactions and clues.**\n\nWe are given four chemical reactions and some properties of the involved substances:\n1.  **A (solid) + 8 B (gas) -> C (bright red product)**\n2.  **C + 2 D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous product)**\n3.  **C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**\n4.  **D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 2: Deduce the identity of the simple gases B, D and the solvent H.**\n\nReaction 4 is a good starting point: a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) forms a solvent (H).\n*   Let's consider common gases. A plausible reaction is the addition of chlorine (Cl₂) to ethene (C₂H₄).\n*   Let **B = Cl₂** (chlorine, a gas) and **D = C₂H₄** (ethene, a gas).\n*   The reaction is: Cl₂(g) + C₂H₄(g) -> CH₂ClCH₂Cl(l)\n*   The product **H = CH₂ClCH₂Cl** (1,2-dichloroethane), which is a common solvent. This fits the description perfectly, including the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n\n**Step 3: Use the identities of B and D to identify A and C.**\n\nNow we use B = Cl₂ and D = C₂H₄ in the other reactions.\n*   **Reaction 1**: A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) -> C(bright red product).\n    The stoichiometry of 1 mole of A to 8 moles of Cl₂ is a strong hint. Sulfur exists as a stable solid allotrope, S₈. Let's test if **A = S₈**.\n    The reaction would be: S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) -> 8 SCl₂(product C).\n    This reaction has the correct 1:8 stoichiometry between A (S₈) and B (Cl₂).\n    The product **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). SCl₂ is described as a cherry-red liquid. This matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identities with Reaction 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3**: C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n*   Let's check the hydrolysis of C = SCl₂. Sulfur dichloride hydrolyzes in water. The reaction is complex, but the ultimate products are elemental sulfur, hydrochloric acid, and sulfurous acid. A balanced equation that represents this is:\n    `16 SCl₂ + 24 H₂O → S₈ + 8 H₂SO₃ + 32 HCl`\n*   Let's check if the products match the description:\n    *   **A**: S₈ (solid) is regenerated. This fits.\n    *   **F**: HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid. This fits.\n    *   **G**: H₂SO₃ (sulfurous acid, from SO₂ dissolved in water) is a weak acid. This fits.\n*   This successful verification gives us high confidence in our identifications so far.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the extremely hazardous product E.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2**: C + 2 D -> E (extremely hazardous).\n*   Substituting our identified compounds: SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ -> E.\n*   This is a known reaction, the Levinstein process for the synthesis of mustard gas:\n    SCl₂ + 2 CH₂=CH₂ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S\n*   The product **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**, which is bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, commonly known as mustard gas. Mustard gas is a notorious chemical warfare agent and is certainly an \"extremely hazardous product\". This identification fits all the clues.\n\n**Summary of identified substances:**\n*   A: S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   B: Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   C: SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   D: C₂H₄ (Ethene)\n*   E: (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (Mustard gas)\n*   F: HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   G: H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   H: C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-Dichloroethane)\n\n**Step 6: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\nThe question asks for the molecular symmetry group of **E**, which is mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂.\nTo determine the point group, we must consider the 3D structure and symmetry elements of the molecule.\n\n1.  The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two identical chloroethyl groups, giving it a bent shape similar to dimethyl ether or H₂O.\n2.  The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotations (C-S, C-C, C-Cl). We need to consider its most stable conformation.\n3.  In its most stable gas-phase conformation, the molecule adopts a specific twist. Let's analyze the symmetry elements of this conformation:\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper rotation axis (Cₙ):** There is a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation about this axis swaps the two chloroethyl groups, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Mirror plane (σ):** There are no mirror planes in the molecule. The plane containing the C-S-C atoms is not a mirror plane because of the positions of the hydrogen and chlorine atoms. A plane perpendicular to the C₂ axis is also not a symmetry element.\n    *   **Inversion center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n    *   **Improper rotation axis (Sₙ):** There are no Sₙ axes.\n\nSince the only symmetry element present (other than the identity E) is a single C₂ axis, the molecular point group is **C₂**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2\nC) D∞h\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
