    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Structure**\n\nThe chemical compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula by counting the carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n-   The structure consists of a central carbon chain with several methyl (CH3) groups attached.\n-   Let's count the atoms in each part of the structure:\n    -   `(CH3)2C=`: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens\n    -   `=CH-`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen\n    -   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens\n    -   `-CH(CH3)-`: 2 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    -   `-CH2-`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens\n    -   `-CH=`: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen\n    -   `=C(CH3)2`: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens\n-   Linking these fragments gives a complete molecule. To avoid double-counting atoms at the junctions, let's build the molecule and count bonds and atoms systematically.\n\nThe structure is:\n` (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 `\n\n-   **Carbon (C) count**: There are 5 methyl groups (2+1+2), so 5 carbons. The main chain has `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`, which is 7 carbons. Total carbons = 5 + 7 = 12 carbons.\n-   **Hydrogen (H) count**: There are 5 methyl groups, so 5 * 3 = 15 hydrogens. On the main chain, we have `=CH-CH2-CH-CH2-CH=`, so 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 hydrogens. Total hydrogens = 15 + 7 = 22 hydrogens.\n-   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in one molecule:\n-   **C=C double bonds**: There are two double bonds in the structure. Count = **2**.\n-   **C-C single bonds**:\n    -   Bonds within the main chain: `=C-C-C-C-C=` has 4 single bonds.\n    -   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the chain: There are 5 methyl groups attached, so 5 single bonds.\n    -   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9**.\n-   **C-H single bonds**: We counted 22 hydrogen atoms, each connected to a carbon by a single bond. Count = **22**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard state (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of gaseous Carbon and 22 moles of gaseous Hydrogen).\n\n-   `12 C(s) -> 12 C(g)`:\n    Energy = 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n-   `11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)`:\n    Energy = 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n-   **Total enthalpy of atomization of elements** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms form one mole of the compound. It is calculated by summing the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule. This value also represents the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n-   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n-   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n-   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n-   **Total bond energy of the compound** = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using Hess's Law:\n`ΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)`\n`ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol`\n\n**5. Convert to the Required Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options provided.\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy, not ΔHf)\nD) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches our ΔHf, but the unit is per gram)\n\nOption B is given in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to these units to check if it matches.\n\n-   **Molar Mass of C12H22**:\n    Molar Mass = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n-   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g**:\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = (ΔHf in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Bond counts\nnum_C_eq_C = 2\nnum_C_C = 9\nnum_C_H = 22\n\n# Given energy values (kJ/mol)\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000\nbond_energy_H_H = 100\nbond_energy_C_C = 200\nbond_energy_C_eq_C = 300\nbond_energy_C_H = 400\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of elements\nenthalpy_atom_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * bond_energy_H_H)\n\n# Total bond energy of the compound\ntotal_bond_energy_compound = (num_C_eq_C * bond_energy_C_eq_C) + (num_C_C * bond_energy_C_C) + (num_C_H * bond_energy_C_H)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol)\ndelta_H_f_mol = enthalpy_atom_elements - total_bond_energy_compound\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses)\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g)\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation = {delta_H_f_gram} kJ/g\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) can be calculated using the following relationship based on Hess's law:\n\n**ΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of elements in their standard state] - [Total bond energy of the compound]**\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and the number of each type of bond.**\n\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds. (Count = 2)\n*   **C-C bonds:** There are 9 single bonds between carbon atoms.\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 single bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements.**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   **Atomization of Carbon:** 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **Atomization of Hydrogen:** 11 mol × (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the compound.**\n\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the gaseous compound is formed from its gaseous atoms. We sum the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Compound:** 600 kJ + 1800 kJ + 8800 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\n\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 5: Check the units of the options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's look at the options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option A. Option C is the total bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation. Option D has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option B is in kJ/g, so let's convert our result to these units.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:**\n    (1900 kJ / 1 mol) × (1 mol / 166 g) = 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value rounds to 11.44 kJ/g, which matches option B. The Python code output also confirms this result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
