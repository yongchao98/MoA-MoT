    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has key NMR features: a single proton peak at 7 ppm (¹H NMR) and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm (¹³C NMR).\n        *   A single ¹H peak at 7.0 ppm suggests two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond.\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 137 ppm is characteristic of sp² carbons in a double bond (C=C).\n        *   A ¹³C peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of carbonyl carbons (C=O) in an anhydride.\n        *   The simplest molecule fitting this description is **maleic anhydride** (derived from *cis*-butenedioic acid, i.e., maleic acid). It has C₂ᵥ symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. The chemical shifts provided are consistent with this structure.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with a five-membered ring. Four methyl groups are on the four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4), and a CH₂ group is at C5. This molecule also possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction is stereospecific. When a cyclic diene reacts with a dienophile, two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The Diels-Alder reaction is typically under kinetic control, meaning the product that forms faster is the major product. The *endo* adduct is formed faster due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the π-system of the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile. Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structures of the Products:**\n    *   The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures of the endo and exo products. The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n    *   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, placing it on the opposite side of the CH₂ bridge (the C7 bridge). This means the anhydride part is spatially close to the double bond (C2=C3) and the methyl groups attached to it.\n    *   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"above\" the newly formed six-membered ring, placing it on the same side as the CH₂ bridge. This means the anhydride part is spatially far from the double bond and its methyl groups, but close to the CH₂ bridge.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY NMR Data:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**.\n    *   This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n    *   From our structural analysis:\n        *   In the **endo (major)** product, the protons on the anhydride part (let's call them Hₐ, at positions C5 and C6) are close to the vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ, at C2 and C3).\n        *   In the **exo (minor)** product, the protons Hₐ are far from the vinylic methyl groups Meᵥ. (Instead, in the exo product, Hₐ would be close to the CH₂ bridge protons).\n    *   Therefore, the unique cross-peak observed in the major product connects the resonances of protons **Hₐ** and the **vinylic methyl groups Meᵥ**.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts and integrals provided in the options to the different types of protons in the product molecule. The total proton count is 16 (2 from anhydride + 14 from diene).\n    *   **Protons on the anhydride part (Hₐ):** These are two equivalent protons (due to symmetry) on sp³ carbons alpha to carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift should be in the range of 3.0-4.0 ppm. They will appear as a **2H singlet** (or a simple multiplet).\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups (Meᵥ):** These are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Their chemical shift is typically around 1.6-2.0 ppm. They will appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups (Meₑₕ):** These are two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These carbons are sterically hindered, and the methyl groups are usually shielded, appearing at a lower chemical shift, around 0.8-1.3 ppm. They will appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons (Hₑ):** These two protons at C7 are not equivalent (diastereotopic). They will likely appear as two separate signals (e.g., a pair of doublets due to geminal coupling), integrating to 1H each. Their shifts can vary, but ~1.5 ppm is a reasonable value for one of them.\n\n6.  **Match the Analysis with the Given Options:**\n    *   The cross-peak in the major product is between Hₐ and Meᵥ.\n    *   Our assignment for Hₐ is a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   Our assignment for Meᵥ is a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Meₑₕ) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one Hₑ proton). This interaction should be present in both isomers.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Meᵥ) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hₐ).** This matches our prediction perfectly. This interaction is unique to the endo (major) product.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Meₑₕ) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Meᵥ). This interaction should be present in both isomers as the groups are on adjacent carbons.\n        *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (one Hₑ proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Hₐ). This interaction would be strong in the exo (minor) product, which is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet of the vinylic methyls (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<B>>>"
