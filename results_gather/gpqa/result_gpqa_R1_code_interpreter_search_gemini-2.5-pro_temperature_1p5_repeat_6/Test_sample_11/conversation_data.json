    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν_μ).\nThe decay equation is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nWe are given:\n*   The initial pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of π⁺ (m_π c²) = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of μ⁺ (m_μ c²) = 105.7 MeV.\n*   Neutrinos (ν) are considered massless (m_ν ≈ 0).\n\nWe need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles, KE_μ and KE_ν.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nTwo fundamental principles of physics govern this decay:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**3. Set up the Equations**\n\n*   **Initial State (Before Decay):**\n    *   The pion is stationary, so its momentum (p_π) is 0.\n    *   Its total energy (E_initial) is just its rest mass energy: E_initial = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV.\n\n*   **Final State (After Decay):**\n    *   The two product particles, μ⁺ and ν, fly apart.\n    *   The total energy (E_final) is the sum of the energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν): E_final = E_μ + E_ν.\n    *   The total momentum (p_final) is the vector sum of their momenta: p_final = **p_μ** + **p_ν**.\n\n**4. Solve Using Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial momentum was zero, the final momentum must also be zero.\n**p_μ** + **p_ν** = 0\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino fly in exactly opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n|**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n**5. Solve Using Conservation of Energy**\n\nE_initial = E_final\nm_π c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nWe can express the total energy of a particle using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ c²\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): Its rest mass is zero, so its energy is entirely kinetic and is related to its momentum by E_ν = pc. Therefore, KE_ν = pc.\n\nSubstitute p = KE_ν / c into the momentum equality: |**p_μ**| = KE_ν / c.\n\nNow, use the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\nE_μ² = (p_μ c)² + (m_μ c²)²\n(KE_μ + m_μ c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ c²)²\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1.  From energy conservation: m_π c² = (KE_μ + m_μ c²) + KE_ν\n    => KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π c² - m_μ c² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV\n2.  From momentum and energy relations: (KE_μ + m_μ c²)² = (KE_ν)² + (m_μ c²)²\n\n**6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n\nA more direct way to solve this is to first find the total energy of the muon (E_μ). From the conservation laws, a standard formula can be derived for a two-body decay from rest:\n\nE_product = [ (E_parent)² + (m_product c²)² - (m_other_product c²)² ] / [ 2 * E_parent ]\n\nApplying this to find the muon's total energy (E_μ):\n*   E_parent = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_product = m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   m_other_product = m_ν = 0\n\nE_μ = [ (m_π c²)² + (m_μ c²)² - (m_ν c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π c² ]\nE_μ = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² - 0² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n\nWe can use a short Python script for this calculation.\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using the derived formula.\nE_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is found by energy conservation.\n# Initial energy (m_pi) = Final energy (E_mu + KE_nu)\nKE_nu = m_pi - E_mu\n\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon (μ⁺) is: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino (ν) is: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (μ⁺) is: 4.12 MeV\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (ν) is: 29.78 MeV\n<<<\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   KE of muon (μ⁺) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   KE of neutrino (ν) ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves the two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) at rest.\n    *   Initial energy (E_i) = Rest mass energy of the pion = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Initial momentum (p_i) = 0, because the pion is stationary.\n\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) moving away from each other.\n    *   Final energy (E_f) = Total energy of the muon (E_μ) + Total energy of the neutrino (E_ν).\n    *   Final momentum (p_f) = Momentum of the muon (**p_μ**) + Momentum of the neutrino (**p_ν**).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before must equal the total momentum after.\n    *   p_i = p_f\n    *   0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν**\n    *   This implies that the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    *   |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before must equal the total energy after.\n    *   E_i = E_f\n    *   m_π c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**3. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is given by the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², where 'p' is its momentum and 'm' is its rest mass.\n\n*   For the **muon (μ⁺)**:\n    *   E_μ² = (p_μ c)² + (m_μ c²)²\n    *   E_μ² = (pc)² + (105.7 MeV)²\n\n*   For the **neutrino (ν)**:\n    *   The neutrino's rest mass is negligible (m_ν ≈ 0).\n    *   E_ν² = (p_ν c)² + (m_ν c²)²\n    *   E_ν² = (pc)² + 0\n    *   So, E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino has no rest mass, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν).\n\n**4. Solve for the Energies**\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions back into our energy conservation equation.\n\nFrom E_ν = pc, we get (pc)² = E_ν². Substitute this into the muon's energy equation:\nE_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ c²)²\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we have E_ν = m_π c² - E_μ. Substitute this into the equation above:\nE_μ² = (m_π c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ c²)²\nE_μ² = (m_π c²)² - 2(m_π c²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μ c²)²\n\nThe E_μ² term cancels out on both sides. We can now rearrange to solve for the total energy of the muon (E_μ):\n2(m_π c²)E_μ = (m_π c²)² + (m_μ c²)²\nE_μ = [ (m_π c²)² + (m_μ c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π c² ]\nE_μ = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nE_μ = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\nE_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\nThis is the total energy of the muon. Its kinetic energy (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μ c²\nKE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) using the conservation of energy:\nKE_μ + KE_ν = Total Kinetic Energy Released\nKE_ν = (m_π c² - m_μ c²) - KE_μ\nKE_ν = (139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV) - 4.12 MeV\nKE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV = 29.78 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (KE_μ) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (KE_ν) ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nComparing this result with the options provided, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
