    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition Process:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0> via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it |n', l', m'>. The decay cascade looks like this:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted (but for a decay, energy must decrease, so n must decrease).\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition:** |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩\n        *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl=±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n        *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm=0, ±1, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   For a decay process, the energy of the atom must decrease. The energy of a state |n,l,m> depends only on n (E_n = -E_R/n², where E_R is the Rydberg energy). So, we need E_n' < E₃, which implies n' < 3.\n        *   Since l'=1, the principal quantum number n' must be at least 2 (as for a given n, l can range from 0 to n-1).\n        *   Combining n'<3 and n'≥2, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is n'=2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        *   The initial state has l'=1 and the final state has l=0. This satisfies Δl = -1, which is an allowed E1 transition.\n        *   The final state has m=0. The possible transitions from the intermediate m' states are:\n            *   m'= -1 → m=0 (Δm = +1, allowed)\n            *   m'= 0 → m=0 (Δm = 0, allowed)\n            *   m'= 1 → m=0 (Δm = -1, allowed)\n        *   All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n\n4.  **Determine the Transition Routes and Probabilities:**\n    We have established three possible decay routes, distinguished by the magnetic quantum number m' of the intermediate |2,1,m'⟩ state:\n    *   Route 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   Route 2: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   Route 3: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n    The question asks for the probability of a given route. This refers to the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the decay from |3,0,0> proceeds to a specific |2,1,m'> state.\n\n    The transition rate Γ from an initial state |i⟩ to a final state |f⟩ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: Γ ∝ |⟨f| **d** |i⟩|², where **d** is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    The initial state |3,0,0> has l=0, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. In spontaneous decay into an isotropic vacuum, there is no preferred direction. The three intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are degenerate in energy and correspond to different orientations of the orbital angular momentum. Due to the rotational symmetry of the situation, the decay rates to these three states must be equal.\n\n    A more formal argument using the Wigner-Eckart theorem confirms this: the transition rate from an |n,l,m⟩ state to an |n',l',m'⟩ state depends on the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For a transition from any |n,0,0⟩ state to an |n',1,m'⟩ state, the relevant squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are all equal to 1. Since the rest of the terms in the rate calculation (radial integral, frequency) are independent of m', the transition rates are identical:\n    Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = Γ(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1. As the rates are equal, their probabilities must be equal:\n    P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)\n    P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n    3 * P(0) = 1  => P(0) = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability for the atom to decay into any specific m' intermediate state is 1/3. The probability of the second step (|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is 1, as this is the only E1 decay channel available to the |2p⟩ state. Therefore, the overall probability for any of the three complete routes is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong.\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong. (Assuming typo in the option's initial state).\n    *   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies a possible route and its corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
