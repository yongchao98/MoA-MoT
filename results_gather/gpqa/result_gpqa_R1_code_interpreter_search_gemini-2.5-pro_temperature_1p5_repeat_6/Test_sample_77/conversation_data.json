    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive these or recall them from standard electromagnetic theory.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **q**: A point charge.\n*   **s(t)**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time. This is the trajectory.\n*   **r**: The position vector of the point where we want to find the potentials (the field point or observation point).\n*   **t**: The time at which we are observing the potentials at point **r**.\n*   **Retardation**: The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, c. So, the potential at **r** at time t is not determined by the charge's position at time t, but by its position at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n*   **tr**: The retarded time is the time at which the field must have been emitted from the charge to reach the point **r** at time t. The time it takes for the signal to travel is `t - tr`. The distance traveled is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n    Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is defined by the implicit equation:\n    `c(t - tr) = |r - s(tr)|`\n\n### 2. Defining the Key Vectors\n\n*   **s(tr)**: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   **d**: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. As defined in the problem, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   **d**: The magnitude of this vector, `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   With this notation, the retardation condition becomes `d = c(t - tr)`.\n*   **v**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = d(s(t))/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas. These are derived from the general retarded potential integrals by treating the charge as a delta function distribution.\n\nThe standard results for the potentials are:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\nHere, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, `μ₀` is the permeability of free space, and all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Simplifying the Expressions\n\nLet's manipulate the expressions to match the format of the options provided. The common denominator is `d - (d · v) / c`.\nWe can rewrite this by factoring out `1/c`:\n\n`d - (d · v) / c = (1/c) * (dc - d · v)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((1/c) * (dc - d · v))]`\n    `V(r, t) = (qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d · v)))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((1/c) * (dc - d · v))]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d · v)))`\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nNow we compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This matches our derived formulas exactly.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge in the denominator.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is also incorrect for the same reason as B, and the expression for A is dimensionally flawed.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect because it has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-` sign. The negative sign is crucial and arises from the physics of retardation and the Doppler effect. The positive sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are given in option A. It's also worth noting that the potentials are related by `A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`, where `c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀)`, which can be verified to hold for the expressions in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
