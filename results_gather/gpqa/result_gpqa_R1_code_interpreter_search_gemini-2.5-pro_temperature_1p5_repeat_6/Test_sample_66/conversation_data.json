    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the basis.**\n    The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis, denoted by $|l, m\\rangle$. Specifically, the state is $|\\Psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, representing the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement and the desired final state.**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. This measurement projects the system onto the uncoupled basis states, which are the eigenstates of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, denoted by $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle$ or simply $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for brevity.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the specific eigenvalues:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    So, the desired final state is $|\\Phi\\rangle = |l_1=1, m_1=-1\\rangle |l_2=1, m_2=-1\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial and final states using the principle of angular momentum addition.**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ given it was initially in the state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\Phi | \\Psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, often written as $C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l}$. These coefficients form the transformation matrix between the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n    The expansion of the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states is:\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l} |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the selection rules for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.**\n    A fundamental property of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers satisfy the relation:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    Let's check this rule for our specific case:\n    *   The magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n    *   The magnetic quantum numbers of the final state are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Comparing the required sum with the initial state's m-value:\n    $-2 \\neq -1$.\n    Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Alternative Reasoning (using operators and eigenvalues):**\n\n1.  The initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    $L_z |2, -1\\rangle = -1\\hbar |2, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  The final state we are measuring is $|1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$. This state is also an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n    $L_z (|1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2) = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$\n    $= (L_{1z}|1, -1\\rangle_1)|1, -1\\rangle_2 + |1, -1\\rangle_1(L_{2z}|1, -1\\rangle_2)$\n    $= (-\\hbar|1, -1\\rangle_1)|1, -1\\rangle_2 + |1, -1\\rangle_1(-\\hbar|1, -1\\rangle_2)$\n    $= (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$\n    $= -2\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n\n3.  The initial state has an $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$, and the state we are trying to measure has an $L_z$ eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n4.  According to a fundamental theorem of quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n5.  Therefore, the inner product of the initial and final states must be zero: $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n6.  The probability, which is the squared magnitude of this inner product, is therefore 0.\n\nConclusion: The probability of finding the system in a state with $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero because such a state would have a total z-component of angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$, while the system is initially in a state with a total z-component of $-1\\hbar$. A measurement cannot change the conserved quantity of total z-angular momentum in this way.\n\n<<<D>>>"
