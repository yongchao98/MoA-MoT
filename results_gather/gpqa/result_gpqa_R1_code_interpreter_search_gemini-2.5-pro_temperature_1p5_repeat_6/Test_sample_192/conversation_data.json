    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to determine how the number of stars per unit range of distance, let's call this `n(r)` or `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Given Information\nWe are told that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". This phrasing describes a density function. It means the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which we can call `n(plx)` or `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n### 3. Identify the Key Physical Relationship\nThe fundamental relationship connecting parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) is that they are inversely proportional. The formula is:\n`plx = 1/r`\nwhere `r` is the distance to the star and `plx` is its parallax angle.\n\n### 4. Formulate a Plan for Conversion\nWe have a relationship for the number of stars in terms of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and we want to find the relationship in terms of distance (`dN/dr`). We can use the chain rule from calculus to switch variables.\n\nThe number of stars `dN` in a small interval is the same whether we describe that interval by `dr` or `d(plx)`. Therefore:\n`dN = (dN/dr) * dr = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\nRearranging this to solve for `dN/dr`, we get:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\nSince the number density cannot be negative, we use the absolute value of the derivative:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n### 5. Execute the Plan\n\n**Step 5a: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\nUsing the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we differentiate with respect to `r`:\n`d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\nThe absolute value is:\n`|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n**Step 5b: Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\nWe are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`.\nWe substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\n**Step 5c: Combine the parts**\nNow we substitute the results from steps 5a and 5b into our chain rule formula from step 4:\n`dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n`dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n`dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) changes proportionally to the cube of the distance (`r³`). Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ r⁵\nB) ~ r^4\nC) ~ r^2\nD) ~ r^3\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
