    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. The reactants are a ketone (butan-2-one) and a source of cyanide ions (NaCN). The product is a cyanohydrin, which has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitrile (-CN) group attached to the same carbon.\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction.\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H3O+`: This represents an acid (like aqueous HCl or H2SO4) and is an excellent proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. This is a standard procedure, often referred to as an \"acidic workup\".\n        *   `NaHSO3`: Sodium bisulfite is used to form crystalline adducts with aldehydes and some ketones, but it does not lead to a cyanohydrin.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H3O+** is the correct choice for the first reaction.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   This reaction is the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions, usually with heating. The presence of water (H₂O) is essential.\n    *   Reagent 'B' is the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n    *   Looking at the options for B:\n        *   `CH3COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not effective for complete nitrile hydrolysis. Strong acids or bases are required.\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a common and effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the suitable reagent for the second reaction.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A should be H3O+ and reagent B should be HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
