    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty, $\\Delta P_z$, of the momentum operator's z-component, $P_z$, for a system in a specific quantum state.\n\n2.  **Define the Operators and the State:**\n    *   The problem provides the matrix representations of the operators $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ in the basis of the eigenvectors of $P_z$. Let's write them down. We can factor out the constant $\\hbar$ for clarity.\n        *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $P_y = \\frac{i\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$, is given as a column vector:\n        *   $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The problem states this is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. Although this information is useful context (and can be verified), we only need the explicit vector form of $|\\psi\\rangle$ and the matrix for $P_z$ to solve the problem. The corresponding \"bra\" vector, $\\langle\\psi|$, is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        *   $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty $\\Delta A$ of an operator $A$ is given by the formula:\n    *   $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    *   Therefore, for our problem: $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n    *   To find $\\Delta P_z$, we need to calculate the expectation value of $P_z$ (i.e., $\\langle P_z \\rangle$) and the expectation value of $P_z^2$ (i.e., $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    *   The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   First, let's compute the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-1) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we multiply this result by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2) \\cdot (-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 0 + (-1/2) \\cdot (1/2) \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right) = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$. We get this by squaring the matrix for $P_z$:\n        $P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   First, let's compute $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we multiply by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2) \\cdot (-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 0 + (-1/2) \\cdot (-1/2) \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right) = \\hbar^2 / 2$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    *   Now we plug the calculated expectation values back into the uncertainty formula:\n        $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = (\\hbar^2 / 2) - (0)^2 = \\hbar^2 / 2$\n    *   Taking the square root of both sides gives the uncertainty:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2 / 2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Final Check with Python:** To ensure the arithmetic is correct, we can perform the matrix calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define h_bar for simplicity, the final answer will be in terms of h_bar\nh_bar = 1.0\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# Define the Pz operator matrix\nPz = h_bar * np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz\n# <Pz> = psi_dagger * Pz * psi\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\nexp_Pz = psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi\n# The result is a 1x1 matrix, we extract the value\nexp_Pz_val = exp_Pz[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the Pz^2 operator matrix\nPz2 = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2\n# <Pz^2> = psi_dagger * Pz^2 * psi\nexp_Pz2 = psi_dagger @ Pz2 @ psi\nexp_Pz2_val = exp_Pz2[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the variance (Delta Pz)^2\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz2_val - (exp_Pz_val**2)\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty (standard deviation) Delta Pz\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\nprint(f\"Expectation value <Pz>: {exp_Pz_val:.4f}*hbar\")\nprint(f\"Expectation value <Pz^2>: {exp_Pz2_val:.4f}*hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"Variance (Delta Pz)^2: {variance_Pz:.4f}*hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty Delta Pz: {uncertainty_Pz:.4f}*hbar\")\n# Let's compare the numerical value with hbar/sqrt(2)\n# 1/sqrt(2) is approx 0.7071\nprint(f\"Value of 1/sqrt(2): {1/np.sqrt(2):.4f}\")\n```\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The step-by-step calculation shows that $\\Delta P_z = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
