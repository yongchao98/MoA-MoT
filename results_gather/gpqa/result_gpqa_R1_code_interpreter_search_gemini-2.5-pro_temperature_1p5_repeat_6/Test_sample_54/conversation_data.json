    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the unknown compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **1H NMR data:**\n    *   `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n    *   `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n    *   `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n    *   `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n\n**2. Decipher Each Signal:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group within an acetate functional group (CH₃-C(=O)O-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the methyl group is isolated, which is consistent with an acetate group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal indicates the presence of an acetate group (`-OAc` or `-O-C(=O)-CH₃`). All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm signals:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.0 - 7.5 ppm):** These chemical shifts are in the vinylic region, indicating the presence of protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** There are two distinct protons on the double bond.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is characteristic of an allylic methyl group, meaning a methyl group attached directly to a double bond (CH₃-C=C).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n\n**3. Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n\n*   We have identified three key fragments:\n    1.  An acetate group: `-O-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    2.  A double bond with two protons: `-CH=CH-`\n    3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond: `CH₃-`\n*   Putting these pieces together, the structure must be `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   This structure is named **propenyl acetate**. A \"propenyl\" group is `CH₃-CH=CH-`.\n*   The options involving \"butenyl acetate\" would require an additional -CH₂- group (forming an ethyl group `CH₃CH₂-` attached to the double bond), which is not supported by the data. Therefore, we can eliminate options C) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n*   The remaining choice is between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The stereochemistry of the double bond can be determined from the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The coupling constant between protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their relative geometry:\n    *   **Trans protons:** J-value is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis protons:** J-value is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   The carbon skeleton is that of a propenyl acetate.\n*   The stereochemistry of the double bond is trans.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's do a final check by assigning all protons to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n\n*   **CH₃(d) at 2.1 ppm (s):** This is the acetate methyl group, which is a singlet as it has no adjacent protons. (Correct)\n*   **CH₃(a) at 1.6 ppm (d):** This is the methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one proton, H(b), so it appears as a doublet. (Correct)\n*   **H(c) at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16.0 Hz):** This vinylic proton is attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen atom, making it more deshielded (higher ppm). It is coupled only to H(b), so it appears as a doublet. The large J-value confirms it is trans to H(b). (Correct)\n*   **H(b) at 5.5 ppm (dq):** This vinylic proton is coupled to H(c) (one proton, making it a doublet 'd') and also to the three protons of CH₃(a) (making it a quartet 'q'). Thus, it appears as a doublet of quartets. (Correct)\n\nAll data points are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
