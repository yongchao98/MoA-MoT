    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let S be the reference frame of the Galaxy (considered stationary for this problem).\n    *   Let S' be the reference frame of the supernova ejecta (the moving frame).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames (v) is 60,000 km/s. This is the speed of the ejecta (S') as measured from the Galaxy (S), and also the speed of the Galaxy (S) as measured from the ejecta (S').\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (S') is Δt' = 50 s. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   To find the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame (S), we need to use the formula `distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   The velocity `v` is already known (60,000 km/s).\n    *   The time `t` must be the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S), not the ejecta's frame.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time passes differently in different inertial frames. The time measured in the stationary frame (S) is dilated relative to the proper time measured in the moving frame (S'). This phenomenon is called \"time dilation\".\n    *   So, the first step is to calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) that corresponds to the 50 seconds (Δt') in the ejecta's frame.\n\n5.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: Δt = γ * Δt'\n    *   Where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   `c` is the speed of light, which is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculations:**\n    *   **Step 6a: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        *   v = 60,000 km/s\n        *   c = 300,000 km/s\n        *   v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n\n    *   **Step 6b: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²)\n        *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\n        *   γ = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n    *   **Step 6c: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   Δt = γ * Δt'\n        *   Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s\n\n    *   **Step 6d: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        *   d = v * Δt\n        *   d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )\n        *   d = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km\n        *   d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km\n\n7.  **Use a calculator or code for the final computation.**\n    A Python script can compute this accurately.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Given values\n    v = 60000  # Velocity in km/s\n    t_prime = 50  # Proper time in seconds\n    c = 300000  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n    # The problem asks for the distance traveled in the Galaxy reference frame.\n    # Distance = velocity_in_galaxy_frame * time_in_galaxy_frame\n    # velocity_in_galaxy_frame is v.\n    # time_in_galaxy_frame (t_dilated) must be calculated from t_prime using the time dilation formula.\n\n    # 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    beta_squared = (v/c)**2\n    gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n    # 2. Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame\n    t_dilated = gamma * t_prime\n\n    # 3. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\n    distance = v * t_dilated\n\n    print(distance)\n\n    ```\n    \n    <execute_output>\n    3061862.1784789725\n    </execute_output>\n    \n8.  **Analyze the Result and Choose the Answer:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Let's compare this with the given options:\n        *   A) 2,880,000 km\n        *   B) 3,060,000 km\n        *   C) 2,940,000 km\n        *   D) 3,000,000 km\n    *   The calculated value is very close to 3,060,000 km. The small difference is likely due to rounding of intermediate values if calculated by hand, but the Python result is precise. Option B is the clear correct choice.\n\n    *   **A note on common mistakes:**\n        *   If one were to ignore relativity and calculate `d = v * t_prime = 60,000 * 50`, the result would be 3,000,000 km (Option D). This is incorrect because it uses time from the wrong reference frame.\n        *   Another potential mistake is to use the concept of length contraction instead of time dilation. Length contraction applies to the measurement of an object's length, not the distance it travels. The distance traveled is `d = v*t`, where `t` is the time measured in the observer's frame.\n\nThe correct approach is to use time dilation to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame and then use that time to calculate the distance traveled.\n\n<<<B>>>"
