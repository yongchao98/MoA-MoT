    "This problem requires us to calculate the distribution of cobalt(II) species in a solution containing thiocyanate ions. We can determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], by calculating its mole fraction relative to all other cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify the Species and Equilibria**\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are formed by the successive addition of thiocyanate (SCN-) ligands to the Co(II) ion. The species are:\n*   [Co(H2O)6]^2+ (free Co^2+ ion)\n*   [Co(SCN)]^+\n*   [Co(SCN)2]\n*   [Co(SCN)3]^-\n*   [Co(SCN)4]^2-\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+ ;  β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9\n*   Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2] ;  β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40\n*   Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^- ;  β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63\n*   Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2- ;  β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16\n\n**2. Define the Mole Fraction (α)**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]\n\nThe mole fraction of a specific complex, for example [Co(SCN)n], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α2:\nα2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\n\n**3. Derive the Calculation Formula**\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration, [Co^2+], and the ligand concentration, [SCN-]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]\n*   [[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2\n*   [[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3\n*   [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)\n\nNow, we can write the formula for α2:\nα2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))\n\nThe [Co^2+] term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the known stability constants and the ligand concentration:\nα2 = (β2[SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n*   β1 = 9\n*   β2 = 40\n*   β3 = 63\n*   β4 = 16\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9%\n\nThe calculation shows that the mole fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9% of the total cobalt in the solution.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is equivalent to calculating the mole fraction (α₂) of this specific complex.\n\n2.  **Define Species and Equilibria:** The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanate complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]\n\n3.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction (α₂):** The mole fraction of the target species, [Co(SCN)₂], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\n5.  **Derive the Calculation Formula:** Substitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3 into the mole fraction formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    By factoring out and canceling the [Co²⁺] term, we get a simplified formula that only depends on the known values of [SCN⁻] and the stability constants:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    *(Note: The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed for this calculation as we are determining the relative percentage. The ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M can be considered constant because it is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration.)*\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** We plug the given values into the formula:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n    Denominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n    Denominator = 2.3646\n\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n7.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe code execution confirmed this result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
