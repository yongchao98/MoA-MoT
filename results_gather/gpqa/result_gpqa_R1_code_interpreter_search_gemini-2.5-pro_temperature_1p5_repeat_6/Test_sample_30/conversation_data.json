    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene (a benzene ring with a -CH₃ group) and a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as **nitration**. The electrophile is the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), generated from HNO₃ and H₂SO₄.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an *ortho-, para-*director and an activating group. It directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions ortho (2,6) and para (4) to itself.\n*   **Product 1:** Due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions, the major product of the mononitration of toluene is **para-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n    Structure of Product 1:\n    A benzene ring with a -CH₃ group and a -NO₂ group in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) and a mixture of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an **oxidation** reaction. The reagent MnO₂ is a relatively mild oxidizing agent. Its primary use in organic synthesis is the selective oxidation of allylic and benzylic alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. While very strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize the methyl group of nitrotoluene all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), the milder MnO₂ is known to oxidize benzylic methyl groups to an aldehyde (-CHO).\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group (-CH₃) of para-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Therefore, product 2 is **para-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n    Structure of Product 2:\n    A benzene ring with a -CHO group and a -NO₂ group in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (para-nitrobenzaldehyde), acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O), and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed condensation reaction between an aldehyde that has no α-hydrogens (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone that does (acetone). This specific type of crossed aldol condensation is known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of para-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  This forms a β-hydroxy ketone intermediate after protonation.\n    4.  This intermediate readily **dehydrates** (loses a molecule of H₂O) under the reaction conditions, because the resulting carbon-carbon double bond is highly stabilized by conjugation with both the aromatic ring and the ketone carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone, specifically **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The trans (E) isomer is favored for steric reasons.\n\n    Structure of Product 3:\n    `p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** Let's analyze the structure of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    `O₂N`—(C₆H₄ ring)—`CH=CH`—`C(=O)`—`CH₃`\n*   **Planarity:** The molecule features an extended system of conjugated π-bonds (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). This extensive conjugation forces the main skeleton of the molecule, `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C=O`, to be planar in its lowest energy conformation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** Exists for all molecules.\n    *   **Rotation Axis (Cn):** There is no C₂ axis or any higher-order rotation axis. Rotating the molecule by 180° does not result in an identical structure because the two ends of the molecule (the nitro group and the acetyl group) are different.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane that contains the planar conjugated backbone (`O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C=O`) is a plane of symmetry for the molecule. The methyl group (-CH₃) can orient itself such that one of its C-H bonds lies within this plane, while the other two hydrogen atoms are positioned symmetrically above and below the plane, being reflections of each other.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
