    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is conserved. The problem is to find the correct expression for the total energy in a relativistic framework.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy of a relativistic particle in a potential.**\n    The total energy `E` of a particle with rest mass `m` and velocity `v` moving in a potential `U(x)` is given by the relativistic Hamiltonian:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    *   $\\gamma mc^2$ is the total relativistic energy of a free particle (rest energy + kinetic energy).\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\n3.  **Define the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator.**\n    The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy `U(x)` is the integral of this force:\n    $U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    So, the conserved total energy for the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:\n    $E = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy to two specific points in the oscillation.**\n    The total energy `E` is constant throughout the motion. We can calculate `E` at two key points and set them equal.\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude (turning point)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the particle momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position**\n        At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$. The particle reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n        At this point, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy is:\n        $E = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n5.  **Equate the energies and solve for  $v_{max}$ .**\n    Since energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 is equal to the energy at Point 2:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    Isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression matches option A perfectly.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\n    *   C) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic result)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
