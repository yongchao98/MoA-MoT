    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute themselves. This is known as electrostatic induction.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** To shield the conducting material from the electric field of the charge `+q`, a charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we imagine a Gaussian surface just inside the bulk of the conductor enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. This implies the net charge enclosed by this surface must be zero. Since there is `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must accumulate on the inner wall of the cavity.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain its overall neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The electric field at any point outside the cavity, produced by the sum of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall, is zero.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P outside the main conductor is caused *only* by the charge present on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge on the outer surface is `+q`. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to be in electrostatic equilibrium. The non-uniform arrangement inside the conductor (the off-center cavity and charge) has no effect on the distribution of charge on the outer surface because of the shielding effect of the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Electric Field outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** A fundamental result from Gauss's Law (also known as the Shell Theorem) is that for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical surface is the center of the conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Electric Field:** Using the principle from step 5, the electric field `E` at point P is the same as the field produced by a point charge `+q` located at the center O of the conductor. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The various other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity radius `r`, the distance `s` between the centers, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `\\theta`, are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. They are provided to test the understanding of the concept of electrostatic shielding. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge `q` that was introduced and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
