    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify each compound and evaluate the given statements.\n\n**Step 1: Compound A to Compound B**\n*   **Compound A** has the molecular formula C3H6. This formula corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4). This is a characteristic test for unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Alkenes undergo an addition reaction under these conditions, while cycloalkanes like cyclopropane do not react (or react under different conditions, e.g., UV light).\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**.\n*   Propene reacts with bromine via electrophilic addition to form 1,2-dibromopropane.\n    CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n*   **Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.**\n\n**Step 2: Compound B to Compound C**\n*   **Compound B** (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   Alcoholic KOH is a strong dehydrohalogenating agent, causing elimination reactions. With a vicinal dihalide (halogens on adjacent carbons), two successive eliminations occur to form an alkyne.\n    CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) --(heat)--> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n*   **Compound C is propyne.**\n\n**Step 3: Compound C to Compound D**\n*   **Compound C** (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube.\n*   This reaction condition causes the cyclic polymerization (trimerization) of alkynes. Three molecules of propyne combine to form a substituted benzene ring. To achieve maximum stability and minimize steric hindrance, they arrange symmetrically.\n    3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n*   **Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as Mesitylene.**\n\n**Step 4: Compound D to Compound E**\n*   **Compound D** (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the standard nitrating mixture (concentrated H2SO4 and concentrated HNO3).\n*   This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The three methyl groups on mesitylene are activating and ortho-, para-directing. In mesitylene, all available positions (2, 4, 6) are equivalent. Nitration occurs at one of these positions.\n*   **Compound E is 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene.**\n\n**Step 5: Compound E to Compound F**\n*   **Compound E** (2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl).\n*   This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   **Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (also known as Mesidine).**\n\n**Step 6: Compound F to Compound G**\n*   **Compound F** (2,4,6-trimethylaniline), a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl), typically at 0-5 °C.\n*   This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amine group into a diazonium salt.\n*   **Compound G is 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride.**\n\n**Step 7: Compound G to Compound H**\n*   **Compound G** (2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This typically implies warming with water (hydrolysis), often in a slightly basic medium, to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   This reaction forms a phenol.\n*   **Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.**\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements based on the identified products:\n\n**A) C is a flammable gas.**\n*   Compound C is propyne. Propyne has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. As a small alkyne, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n*   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride (FeCl3) test is used to detect phenols, which typically give a distinct color like violet, green, or blue. However, phenols with bulky groups near the -OH group (steric hindrance) may not react. The three methyl groups in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol provide enough steric hindrance to prevent the formation of the colored complex with Fe³⁺ ions. Therefore, no color change occurs, and the solution remains the original color of the aqueous ferric chloride reagent, which is yellow or yellowish-brown. Describing this negative test as \"gives a yellow color\" is chemically inaccurate, as it implies a positive reaction outcome. The statement is misleading. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n*   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). Due to the molecule's symmetry, all three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and all three ring protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The nine protons of the three methyl groups will produce a single signal (a singlet).\n    *   The three protons on the aromatic ring will produce another single signal (a singlet).\n*   Thus, its ¹H NMR spectrum consists of two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n*   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are classic starting materials for the synthesis of azo dyes. They are diazotized (like in the step to form G) and then coupled with other aromatic compounds (like phenols or other amines) to produce brightly colored azo compounds. This statement is **correct**.\n\nThe incorrect statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
