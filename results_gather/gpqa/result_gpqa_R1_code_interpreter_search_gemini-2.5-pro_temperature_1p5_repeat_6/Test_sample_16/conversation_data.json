    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a calcium-EDTA complex solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction and equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem describes a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex will slightly dissociate into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$), to establish an equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    Dissociation reaction: $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n    The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, with $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-10} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$.\n\n    The expression for the dissociation constant is:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\n    The problem states the pH is \"ideal\", which we interpret to mean that we don't need to consider the protonation of the free EDTA anion. We can use the absolute formation constant directly.\n\n2.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation. The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M.\n\n    | Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    | ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n    | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | $Y^{4-}$            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n3.  **Solve the equilibrium expression.**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the $K_d$ expression:\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Since $K_d$ is extremely small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$), the extent of dissociation (x) will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows us to make the simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the value of x.**\n    Now, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    We can confirm this calculation using a Python script.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    k_f = 5e10\n    conc_complex = 0.02\n    \n    # The dissociation constant Kd = 1 / Kf\n    k_d = 1 / k_f\n    \n    # We solve the equation x^2 / (conc_complex - x) = k_d\n    # Since Kd is very small, we can approximate conc_complex - x ≈ conc_complex\n    # So, x^2 ≈ k_d * conc_complex\n    # x represents the concentration of Ca2+ ions\n    x_squared = k_d * conc_complex\n    x = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n    \n    print(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n    ```\n    \n    **Execution Output:**\n    \n    6.32e-07\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    D) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
