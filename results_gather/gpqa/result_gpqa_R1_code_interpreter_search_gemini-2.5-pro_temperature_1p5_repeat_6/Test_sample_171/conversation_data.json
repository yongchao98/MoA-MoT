    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem relates the population of atomic energy levels to temperature. This relationship is described by the **Boltzmann equation**, which is applicable here because the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, an upper level (let's call it `u`) and a lower level (`l`):\n\n    N_u / N_l = (g_u / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   `N_u` and `N_l` are the number of atoms in the upper and lower states, respectively.\n    *   `g_u` and `g_l` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_u - E_l` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    *   Let the ratio of excited atoms for star_1 (temperature T_1) be `R_1`.\n        R_1 = (N_u / N_l)_1 = (g_u / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))\n\n    *   Let the ratio of excited atoms for star_2 (temperature T_2) be `R_2`.\n        R_2 = (N_u / N_l)_2 = (g_u / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))\n\n4.  **Use the condition from the problem statement:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:**\n    (g_u / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_u / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight factor `(g_u / g_l)` is the same for the iron atoms in both stars, so it cancels out:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))\n\n7.  **Isolate the temperature terms:** To eliminate the exponentials, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    -ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]\n    -ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_2)\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):**\n    ΔE / (k_B * T_2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Factor out the common terms and combine fractions:**\n    (ΔE / k_B) * [ (1/T_2) - (1/T_1) ] = ln(2)\n    (ΔE / k_B) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n10. **Evaluate the constant factor (ΔE / k_B):** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k_B ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio is:\n    ΔE / k_B ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    Note: The units work out. The expression `ΔE / (k_B * T)` must be dimensionless, so `ΔE / k_B` has units of temperature (Kelvin). The problem is cleverly designed so this factor is just 1.\n\n11. **Substitute this value back into the equation:**\n    (1) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n12. **Compare with the given options:** The derived equation `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
