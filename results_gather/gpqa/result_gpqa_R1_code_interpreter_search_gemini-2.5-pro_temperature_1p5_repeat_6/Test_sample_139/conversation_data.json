    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B:**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    *   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is significantly different from that of regular water (H₂O), which is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   However, this is the characteristic melting point of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between G and B:**\n    *   The problem states that precipitate G, when heated, releases B.\n    *   Since B is D₂O, G must be a compound that contains D₂O, likely a deuterated hydrate (a \"deuterate\"), which decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. A common example would be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main reaction to identify Y and W:**\n    *   The main reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G.\n    *   Since G is a deuterated compound (M(OD)n), it's highly likely that the reactant, Liquid Y, was the source of deuterium, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is violent: X + D₂O → W(g) + G(ppt). This suggests X is a highly reactive substance with water, like an alkali metal, a metal hydride, or a similar reactive species.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine candidates for W, assuming it's formed from X reacting with D₂O.\n        *   A likely product from such a reaction is hydrogen gas. If the reactants contain deuterium, the gas would be D₂.\n        *   Let's check D₂: A deuterium atom (D, or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂(g) and a precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n    *   We are also told that X, and \"especially its very close analog,\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. The \"analog\" would be the regular hydrogen version (e.g., LiAlH₄), and substance X would be its deuterated form.\n    *   Let's test **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** as Substance X. Its analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   Let's check if this fits all the clues:\n        *   **Violent reaction?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. The reaction with D₂O would be similarly violent.\n        *   **Gas W?** The reaction produces D₂, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G?** The reaction produces Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Thus, Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G releases B?** Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose into the metal oxide and water (or heavy water). `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This reaction releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n        *   **Reaction with a keto acid?** A keto acid has the structure R-C(=O)-COOH and contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups to alcohols. The product would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This final product molecule contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This crucial clue fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:**\n    All the evidence points to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n    *   The question specifies summing the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the formula. We will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, and the most stable isotope for Al, which is ²⁷Al).\n    *   **Lightest element (Hydrogen):** It is present as the isotope Deuterium (D). Its mass number is 2. There are four D atoms in the formula LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum):** It is present as the isotope ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** Sum the total masses calculated above.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from D) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
