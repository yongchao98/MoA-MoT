The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å.

    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo (reflectivity).\n\n*   **Step 2: Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Let's write out the formula for each planet and divide them:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\n*   **Step 3: Simplify the Ratio**\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` terms also cancel. The constant `2` also cancels. This leaves us with a much simpler expression:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n    The periodic Doppler shift is caused by the star \"wobbling\" due to the planet's gravitational pull. The maximum radial velocity (`K`) of the star is related to the orbital parameters. For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the formula is:\n    `K = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    Where `i` is the orbital inclination and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    The problem states the planets were detected by the transit method, which means they pass in front of the star from our perspective. This implies an inclination `i` is very close to 90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. We can simplify the formula to:\n    `K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (`a`)**\n    We need to rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    `K^2 = (m_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n    `K^2 = (m_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (G * m_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n*   **Step 6: Find the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (`a_2 / a_1`)**\n    Now we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1` using the formula derived in the previous step:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(G * m_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * m_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (m_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (m_p1^2 / K_1^2)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n*   **Step 7: Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (`K`)**\n    The radial velocity `v` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by `Δλ / λ_0 = v / c`. The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, `K`. Therefore:\n    `K_1` is proportional to `Δλ_1` and `K_2` is proportional to `Δλ_2`.\n    The ratio `K_1 / K_2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n*   **Step 8: Combine the Ratios**\n    Substitute the result from Step 7 into the equation from Step 6:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n    Now, substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio from Step 3:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt[ (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 ]`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m_p2 / m_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\n*   **Step 9: Calculate the Final Value**\n    We are given:\n    *   `m_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n    *   `m_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n    *   `Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å`\n    *   `Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n    Now, we compute the decimal value.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio\nm_p1 = 7  # Earth masses\nm_p2 = 5  # Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# Ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m_p2 / m_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nratio = (m_p2 / m_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
