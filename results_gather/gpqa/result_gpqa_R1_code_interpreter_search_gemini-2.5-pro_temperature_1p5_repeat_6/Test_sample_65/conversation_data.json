    "SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM). Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is the symmetry under rotations and boosts. It is a fundamental principle of special relativity and any relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT). SMEFT is, by construction, a relativistic QFT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** This symmetry group includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational assumption in the construction of any standard QFT, including the SM and SMEFT. The Lagrangian density, from which operators are built, must be a scalar under Poincare transformations to ensure that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers and at all points in spacetime. Thus, Poincare symmetry must be respected. Note that Poincare symmetry is a larger group that contains Lorentz symmetry, so respecting Poincare symmetry implies respecting Lorentz symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). The Standard Model itself contains terms (specifically in the CKM matrix of the weak interaction sector) that violate CP symmetry. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it is not required to be more symmetric. In fact, many of the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
