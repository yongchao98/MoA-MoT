    "Answering this question requires comparing the transit probabilities of two exoplanets.\n\n**1. Understanding Transit Probability**\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, for a circular orbit, is given by the formula:\n`P_transit = R_star / a`\nwhere `R_star` is the radius of the host star and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Applying Kepler's Third Law**\nTo find the semi-major axis `a`, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. For a planet with mass `M_p` orbiting a star of mass `M_star`, the law is:\n`P^2 = (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * (M_star + M_p))`\nwhere `P` is the orbital period and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the mass of an Earth-like planet (`M_p`) is negligible compared to its host star (`M_star`), we can simplify the equation to:\n`P^2 ≈ (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * M_star)`\n\nSolving for the semi-major axis `a`:\n`a^3 ≈ (G * M_star * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n`a ≈ [ (G * M_star * P^2) / (4 * π^2) ] ^ (1/3)`\n\nThis shows that `a` is proportional to `(M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\n**3. Deriving the Proportionality for Transit Probability**\nNow, substitute the expression for `a` back into the transit probability formula:\n`P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n`P_transit ∝ R_star * M_star^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities**\nWe need to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`P_transit_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`P_transit_2`):\n`Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`\n`Ratio = [R_star1 * M_star1^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)] / [R_star2 * M_star2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3)]`\n`Ratio = (R_star1 / R_star2) * (M_star1 / M_star2)^(-1/3) * (P1 / P2)^(-2/3)`\n\n**5. Plugging in the Given Values**\nLet's use the information from the problem:\n- The host stars have the same radii: `R_star1 = R_star2`, so `R_star1 / R_star2 = 1`.\n- The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's host star: `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`, so `M_star1 / M_star2 = 2`.\n- The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's: `P1 = P2 / 3`, so `P1 / P2 = 1/3`.\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio equation:\n`Ratio = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * (3^(-1))^(-2/3)`\n`Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n`Ratio = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (3^2)^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = 9^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities\nratio = (4.5)**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_return>\n1.650964003991217\n</execute_return>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio is approximately 1.65.\n\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The transit probability (`P_transit`) is the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_star`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).\n`P_transit = R_star / a`\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis `a` is related to the orbital period `P` and the host star's mass `M_star` as follows:\n`a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\nBy substituting the expression for `a` into the transit probability formula, we get:\n`P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2:\n`Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = [R_star1 / (M_star1 * P1^2)^(1/3)] / [R_star2 / (M_star2 * P2^2)^(1/3)]`\n`Ratio = (R_star1 / R_star2) * (M_star2 / M_star1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_star1 = R_star2`, so `R_star1 / R_star2 = 1`.\n*   The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's: `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`, so `M_star2 / M_star1 = 1/2`.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's: `P1 = P2 / 3`, so `P2 / P1 = 3`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n`Ratio = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n`Ratio = (3^2)^(1/3) / (2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 1.65. This indicates that Planet_1 has a transit probability that is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
