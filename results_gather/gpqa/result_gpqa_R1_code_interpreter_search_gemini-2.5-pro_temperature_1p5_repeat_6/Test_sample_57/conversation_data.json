    "*   **Analyze the concepts:** The question asks which theory does not require \"regularization at high energies.\"\n    *   **Regularization:** In quantum field theory (QFT), when we calculate physical quantities using perturbation theory (often visualized with Feynman diagrams), we encounter integrals that diverge, meaning they go to infinity. These divergences typically happen when we integrate over all possible energies and momenta of virtual particles in loops, specifically at the high-energy (or short-distance) end of the spectrum. This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence. Regularization is a mathematical procedure to tame these infinities, making the integrals temporarily finite by introducing a parameter called a regulator (e.g., a momentum cutoff).\n    *   **Renormalization:** After regularization, a subsequent process called renormalization is used to absorb the divergent parts into a redefinition of the theory's fundamental parameters (like mass and charge), leaving finite, physically meaningful predictions.\n    *   A theory that requires regularization and renormalization to make sense of high-energy calculations is called \"renormalizable.\" A theory that is finite from the start and does not have these UV divergences is called \"UV-complete\" or \"finite.\"\n\n*   **Evaluate each option:**\n\n    *   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** While not a quantum field theory, it has its own famous high-energy divergence problem: the self-energy of an ideal point charge is infinite. Calculating the energy stored in the electric field of a point charge results in an integral that diverges as the distance from the charge approaches zero. So, it does have a high-energy pathology.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electrons and photons. QED was the first successful quantum field theory, and it is the textbook example of a theory that *requires* regularization and renormalization. Loop calculations for quantities like the Lamb shift and the electron's anomalous magnetic moment are plagued with infinities that must be handled by this procedure.\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of quarks and gluons (the strong force). Like QED, it is a quantum field theory based on point particles. It is also renormalizable, meaning its calculations produce UV divergences that must be managed with regularization and renormalization.\n\n    *   **B) Superstring Theory:** This theory is fundamentally different from the others. Instead of point-like fundamental particles, it posits that the basic constituents of the universe are tiny, vibrating one-dimensional strings. A key motivation for string theory is that it resolves the divergence problems of point-particle QFTs. The interactions between strings are not localized at a single point in spacetime but are \"smeared out.\" This smearing effect naturally smooths out the interactions at very short distances (high energies), and as a result, the calculations of scattering amplitudes are believed to be finite. The theory does not produce the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences found in QED and QCD. Therefore, it is considered UV-complete and does not require regularization for high-energy infinities.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** QED and QCD are classic examples of theories that *need* regularization. Classical Electrodynamics also has a high-energy divergence problem. Superstring Theory is specifically constructed in a way that is believed to avoid these high-energy divergences altogether, making it finite and not in need of regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
