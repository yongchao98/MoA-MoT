    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The approach involves calculating the initial moles of all acidic and basic species, determining the outcome of neutralization reactions, and then calculating the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n    Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    Molarity = 0.1 M\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.\n\n*   **Moles of HCl (a strong acid):**\n    Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    Molarity = 0.2 M\n    Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 moles of HCl.\n    Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 moles of H+.\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (a strong base):**\n    Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    Molarity = 0.3 M\n    Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.\n    Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely according to the equation: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n    Therefore, the moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 moles = 0.18 moles of OH⁻.\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe neutralization will occur in steps. The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂) first.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n    Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n    Since there are more moles of OH⁻ than H⁺, all the H⁺ from HCl will be consumed.\n    Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol.\n\nNow, the solution contains 0.10 moles of OH⁻ (strong base) and 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid). The remaining strong base will react with the weak acid.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n    Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.10 mol\n    Again, the moles of OH⁻ are in excess. All the CH₃COOH will be consumed.\n    Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.05 mol.\n    Final moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH⁻ (a strong base) and 0.05 moles of CH₃COO⁻ (a weak base). The pH of the solution will be dominated by the concentration of the strong base (OH⁻), as its contribution to the overall hydroxide concentration is far greater than that of the weak base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M.\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH + pOH = 14\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nLet's double-check the calculations with a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles calculations\nmoles_h_strong = 0.2 * 0.400 # H+ from HCl\nmoles_weak_acid = 0.1 * 0.500 # CH3COOH\nmoles_oh_strong = 2 * (0.3 * 0.300) # OH- from Ba(OH)2\n\n# Net moles of acid/base after reaction\n# A positive value means excess H+, a negative value means excess OH-\nnet_moles = (moles_h_strong + moles_weak_acid) - moles_oh_strong\n# However, this doesn't account for reaction order. We need to neutralize strong species first.\n\n# 1. Neutralize strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\n# 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left\n\n# 2. Neutralize remaining strong base with weak acid\nfinal_moles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction - moles_weak_acid\n# 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- excess\n\n# 3. Calculate final concentration and pH\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300 # 1.2 L\nfinal_oh_concentration = final_moles_oh_excess / total_volume_L\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH = {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH = 12.62\n\nThe calculation confirms that the final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 1.38\nC) 12.62\nD) 8.68\n\nThe calculated pH matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution created by mixing a weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH), a strong acid (hydrochloric acid, HCl), and a strong base (barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂).
