    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space.\n\n1.  **Understand the Density Matrix:**\n    The given density matrix is:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n    This represents a quantum state that is an equal statistical mixture of the basis state `|0⟩` and the basis state `|1⟩`.\n\n2.  **Convert to Matrix Form:**\n    In quantum computing, the standard basis states are represented by vectors:\n    $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    From these, we can construct the outer products `|0⟩⟨0|` and `|1⟩⟨1|`:\n    $|0\\rangle\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, substitute these matrices back into the expression for ρ:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix is $\\frac{1}{2}I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n3.  **Relate to the Bloch Sphere Representation:**\n    Any single-qubit density matrix can be uniquely represented by a vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ within the Bloch sphere using the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector $\\vec{r}$:**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can be found using the relation $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$.\n\n    *   **Calculate $r_x$**:\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\n    *   **Calculate $r_y$**:\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i/2 \\\\ i/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\n    *   **Calculate $r_z$**:\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0$\n\n    Alternatively, by comparing our matrix $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$ with the general form $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$, we can see that the term $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ must be the zero matrix. This is only possible if the vector $\\vec{r}$ is the zero vector.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This position corresponds to the exact center of the Bloch sphere and represents the maximally mixed state, where there is complete uncertainty about the state of the qubit.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(1,1,0)\nC) r=(1,1,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
