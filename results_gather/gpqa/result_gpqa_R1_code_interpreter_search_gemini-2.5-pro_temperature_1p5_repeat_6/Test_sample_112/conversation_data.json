    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** I'll analyze each piece of evidence provided.\n\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for an O-H stretch. The broadness is key; it strongly suggests the O-H is part of a carboxylic acid due to hydrogen bonding, which creates a very wide absorption band. An alcohol O-H stretch is also in this region but is typically less broad.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Paired with the broad O-H peak, a carboxylic acid (C=O stretch ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is the most likely candidate.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** This explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This reinforces the conclusion from the 1650 cm⁻¹ FTIR peak.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** I need to identify what common fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the functional group we suspect: the carboxyl group (-COOH).\n            *   Carbon (C) ≈ 12 amu\n            *   Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 amu\n            *   Hydrogen (H) ≈ 1 amu\n            *   Mass of -COOH = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n        *   This m/z = 45 peak is a very strong confirmation for a carboxylic acid, as the cleavage of the bond next to the carbonyl group (alpha-cleavage) to lose the -COOH group is a common fragmentation pathway.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This accounts for the broad O-H, the C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the m/z=45 fragment. It also means the molecule must contain at least two oxygen atoms.\n    *   The compound contains a carbon-carbon double bond (alkene). This accounts for the C=C peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR.\n\n    Therefore, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options using Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C, H, and O is:\n    DoU = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n    My analysis indicates the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C alkene. Let's calculate the DoU for each option.\n\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n        *   This fits our requirement for two degrees of unsaturation. It also has two oxygen atoms, which is required for a carboxylic acid. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **B) C6H10O:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2.\n        *   While it has the correct DoU, it only has one oxygen. This would make it an unsaturated ketone or aldehyde, which is less consistent with the very broad O-H peak and the m/z=45 fragment characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **C) C6H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        *   This has only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), but it cannot have the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n    *   **D) C6H12O:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1.\n        *   This has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. This could be a saturated ketone/aldehyde or an unsaturated alcohol, neither of which fits all the data.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The formula **C6H10O2** is the only one that satisfies all the experimental evidence:\n    *   It has two oxygens, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   It has two degrees of unsaturation, accommodating one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n<<<A>>>"
