    "This problem requires us to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field over a sphere of radius R.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude that falls off as `1/r^2` and is directed radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**3. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dA)`\nwhere `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n**Why the Divergence Theorem is appropriate here:**\nA direct calculation of the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` runs into a problem. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a field `f = f_r * r̂` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\nFor our field, `f_r = 1/r^2`. So,\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\nThis calculation is valid for all `r > 0`. However, at the origin `(r = 0)`, the field `f` is infinite, creating a singularity. The divergence is undefined at this single point. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this by converting the volume integral (which contains the singularity) into a surface integral (which is on the boundary `r = R`, where the field is well-behaved). The contribution from the singularity at the origin is captured by the flux through the enclosing surface. This is the essence of Gauss's Law in electromagnetism.\n\n**4. Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n\n*   **The vector field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere `S`, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So the field `f` on the surface is:\n    `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n*   **The differential surface area vector:** For a sphere, the differential area element `dA` is a vector that points radially outward (in the direction of `r̂`) and has a magnitude of `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    `dA = r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dA`:**\n    `f ⋅ dA = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ r̂ * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dA = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the surface `S`:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dA) = ∫(φ=0 to 2π) ∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= [ ∫(φ=0 to 2π) dφ ] * [ ∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ ]`\n\n    Evaluate each integral:\n    `∫(φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`\n    `∫(θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dA) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThe result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as the sphere encloses the origin where the singularity is located.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 4 π\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
