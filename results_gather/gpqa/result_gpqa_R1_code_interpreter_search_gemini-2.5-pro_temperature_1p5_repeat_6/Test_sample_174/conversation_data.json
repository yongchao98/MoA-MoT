    "The user wants to determine the characteristics of radiation from an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the physical model:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a \"spheroid in shape\" and a symmetry axis (z-axis). The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from such a system is electric dipole radiation. This occurs when the center of the charge distribution oscillates along the symmetry axis, creating a time-varying electric dipole moment `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt)`. We will proceed with this model, as it represents the lowest-order, most fundamental radiation mechanism.\n\n2.  **Analyze the angular dependence of radiated power:**\n    For an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the far-field (radiation zone) is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the dipole axis (z-axis), and `C` is a factor that depends on the frequency (and thus wavelength) and the amplitude of the dipole moment, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n    The function `f` mentioned in the problem is this power per unit solid angle: `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n\n    The problem states that the maximum power radiated per unit solid angle is `A`. This maximum occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\n    We need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. Let's calculate the power at this angle:\n    `P(30°) = dP/dΩ` at `θ = 30°`\n    `P(30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\n    Since `A = C`, we can write:\n    `P(30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n\n    The fraction is `P(30°) / A`:\n    Fraction = `(A * sin²(30°)) / A = sin²(30°)`\n\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the wavelength dependence of radiated power:**\n    Now we need to determine the form of `f(λ, θ)`, specifically its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The full formula for the power per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)`\n    where:\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `μ₀` is the permeability of free space.\n\n    The key relationship is between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ`:\n    `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`\n\n    From the formula, we can see that the power per unit solid angle is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    Substituting the expression for `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    This `1/λ⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation (and Rayleigh scattering), which is radiation from sources much smaller than the wavelength.\n    So, a possible form for the function `f` is `f ∝ λ⁻⁴`.\n\n4.  **Combine the results:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   The radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    Matching these two results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    B) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n    Our calculated results directly correspond to option A.\n\n5.  **Consider alternative models (for completeness):**\n    If the radiation were from an electric quadrupole (the next higher-order term), the power would be proportional to `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and `ω⁶` (or `λ⁻⁶`). This would lead to a fraction of `3/4` and a dependence of `λ⁻⁶` (Option D). However, without any information to suggest that the dipole moment is zero or suppressed, we assume the dominant radiation comes from the lowest possible order, which is the dipole. Therefore, the dipole model is the most appropriate.\n\nThe calculation for the fraction is simple and does not require a code interpreter, but we can verify it.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_degrees = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians for use in math functions\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# The radiated power is proportional to sin(theta)^2.\n# The maximum power is proportional to sin(90)^2 = 1.\n# The power at 30 degrees is proportional to sin(30)^2.\n# The fraction is sin(30)^2 / sin(90)^2 = sin(30)^2.\nfraction = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\nprint(f\"The value of sin(30 degrees) is: {math.sin(theta_radians)}\")\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\n```\n> The value of sin(30 degrees) is: 0.49999999999999994\n> The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is: 0.24999999999999994\n\nThe python code confirms that the fraction is 0.25, or 1/4.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Based on the standard model of electric dipole radiation, the fraction is 1/4 and the wavelength dependence is λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for two things:\n1.  The fraction of maximum radiated power at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n2.  A possible form for the function `f(λ, θ)`, which represents the radiated power per unit solid angle.\n\n**1. Radiated Power vs. Angle (θ)**\n\n*   The system is an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a spheroidal shape and a symmetry axis (z-axis). The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from such a system is electric dipole radiation. We can model this as an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis.\n*   For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the dipole moment but not on `θ`.\n*   The function `f` in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n*   The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (in the equatorial plane). Therefore, `A` corresponds to the value of `C * 1`, so `A = C`.\n*   We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°`. We substitute this angle into the formula:\n    `Power at 30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` is:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / A = (C * sin²(30°)) / C = sin²(30°)\n*   Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n**2. Radiated Power vs. Wavelength (λ)**\n\n*   The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴` (this comes from the Larmor formula for accelerating charges).\n    `P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n*   The power per unit solid angle also has this dependency: `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`.\n*   The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n*   Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n*   This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also seen in Rayleigh scattering, which is scattering from particles much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n*   Therefore, a possible form for the function `f` is one that is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n*   A possible form of the function `f` is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
