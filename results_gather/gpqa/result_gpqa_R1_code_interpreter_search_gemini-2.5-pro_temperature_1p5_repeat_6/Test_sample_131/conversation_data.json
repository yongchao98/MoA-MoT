    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds:**\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two aromatic protons (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent. The four methyl groups are also equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H).\n        *   Aliphatic: One singlet (12H, from 4 x CH3).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. It also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H, from H4 and H6).\n        *   Aliphatic: Three singlets. One for the C1/C3 methyls (6H), one for the C2 methyl (3H), and one for the C5 methyl (3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes the protons at C5 and C6 equivalent. It also makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (2H, from H5 and H6).\n        *   Aliphatic: Two singlets. One for the C1/C4 methyls (6H) and one for the C2/C3 methyls (6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Correct)\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. All four aromatic protons are equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   Predicted Spectrum:\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (4H).\n        *   Aliphatic: The ethyl groups would show coupling. A quartet for the CH2 protons and a triplet for the CH3 protons.\n    *   The problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture Spectrum:**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1 and all three candidate tetramethylbenzenes have a 2H aromatic singlet, any pair of them would produce two singlets of equal integration (2H:2H = 1:1). This observation confirms that there are two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the total number of methyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24.\n    *   The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   So, we need a combination of two compounds that gives one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this would result in three 6H signals and two 3H signals (assuming no overlap), which is not what is observed.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this gives exactly one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets. The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined, this would give four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only combination that produces the observed NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets) is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
