    "E°(O₂/H₂O) = +1.23 V (in acidic solution)\nE°(O₂/OH⁻) = +0.40 V (in basic solution)\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidizing agent.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamic Strength**\n\n1.  **In acidic solution**, the reduction of oxygen is:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this half-reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n\n2.  **In basic solution**, the reduction of oxygen is:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this half-reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\nComparing the two E° values:\n+1.23 V (acidic) > +0.40 V (basic)\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of oxygen is lower in basic solution compared to acidic solution, oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This fills the first blank.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetic Reactivity**\n\nKinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. While thermodynamics tells us that oxygen is a very strong oxidant (especially in acidic solutions), experience shows that many substances that should be oxidized by oxygen are stable in its presence (e.g., an iron nail doesn't instantly rust away). This implies that the reaction is kinetically slow.\n\nThe reduction of O₂ is a multi-step process involving the transfer of four electrons. Breaking the strong O=O double bond (bond enthalpy ~498 kJ/mol) requires a high activation energy. The initial one-electron reduction to form the superoxide radical (O₂⁻) is particularly slow and represents the rate-determining step. This high activation energy barrier makes the overall reaction kinetically slow, regardless of whether the solution is acidic or basic.\n\nThe question asks about the reaction rate in *acidic solutions*. Due to the high activation energy required to initiate the reduction of O₂, the reaction is kinetically **slower**. This fills the second blank.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination \"weaker - slower\".\n\n<<<B>>>"
