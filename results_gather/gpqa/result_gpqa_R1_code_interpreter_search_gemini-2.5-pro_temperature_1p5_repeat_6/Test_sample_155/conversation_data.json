    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this stereochemistry problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2   H\n           \\  /\n            C==C\n           /  \\\n          H   CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is symmetric and achiral, the epoxidation reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen bridge. This is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A key rule in stereochemistry is: **_anti_-addition to a _trans_-alkene yields a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this. The (4R,5R)-epoxide will be attacked by water, inverting the configuration at one carbon (e.g., C4), leading to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The (4S,5S)-epoxide will similarly lead to (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are different names for the *same* achiral meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n      CH3CH2   CH2CH3\n           \\  /\n            C==C\n           /  \\\n          H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used: mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺. This is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding rule in stereochemistry is: **_anti_-addition to a _cis_-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   First, the *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene forms the *cis*-epoxide (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane), which is a single achiral, meso compound.\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two equivalent carbons (C4 or C5).\n        *   Attack at C4 leads to one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 leads to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting epoxide is achiral, the two pathways are equally probable, resulting in a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers.\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these compounds is as follows:\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is a **diastereomer** of Compound 2 ((R,R)).\n*   Compound 1 (meso) is also a **diastereomer** of Compound 3 ((S,S)).\n*   Compound 2 ((R,R)) and Compound 3 ((S,S)) are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 vs. the 2/3 pair) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (R,R)- and (S,S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Total: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers (compounds 2 and 3) into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso compound (compound 1) from the other two, as it is their diastereomer.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three unique molecules in the mixture.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
