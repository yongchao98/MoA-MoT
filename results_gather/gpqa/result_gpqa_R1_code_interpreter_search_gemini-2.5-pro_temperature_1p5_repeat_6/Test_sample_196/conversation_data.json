    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from the given spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, indicating it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is more upfield, suggesting it is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl group analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the alkyl substituent.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Let's call this (a).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to multiple, non-equivalent protons. It is likely next to the methyl group (a) and a methine group. Let's call this (b).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-). Let's call this (c).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is likely a methine group (-CH-) that is deshielded because it's attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton). It must be adjacent to the methyl group (c) and the methylene group (b).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:**\n            *   From the signals, we have a -CH(CH₃)- fragment and a -CH₂CH₃ fragment.\n            *   The methine proton at 2.9 ppm is split by both the methyl protons (c) and the methylene protons (b), explaining why it's a multiplet.\n            *   The methylene protons at 1.7 ppm are split by both the methyl protons (a) and the methine proton, also explaining its multiplet appearance.\n            *   Putting it all together, the alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The compound is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option C.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding methyl groups (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group, being an alkane substituent, will not be affected by these conditions.\n    *   **Product Formation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The predicted product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   This corresponds to option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
