This means the peak at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from the quasar. The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyα line is approximately 121.57 nm.\n\nFirst, we calculate the redshift (z) of the quasar:\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (790 nm / 121.57 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.50 - 1 = 5.50\n\nNext, we calculate the comoving distance (D_C) for a flat ΛCDM universe. The formula for the comoving distance is:\nD_C = (c / H₀) * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\nwhere:\n*   c is the speed of light (≈ 299792 km/s)\n*   H₀ is the Hubble constant = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)³ + Ω_Λ) for a flat universe.\n\nThe parameters given are:\n*   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Ω_m = 0.3\n*   Ω_Λ = 0.7\n\nPlugging in the values and performing the numerical integration from z = 0 to z = 5.50:\nThe Hubble Distance, D_H = c / H₀ ≈ 299792 / 70 ≈ 4282.7 Mpc.\nThe integral ∫[from 0 to 5.50] dz' / sqrt(0.3(1+z')³ + 0.7) needs to be computed numerically.\nThe execution of the provided python code gives:\n*   Redshift z ≈ 5.50\n*   Comoving Distance ≈ 8.98 Gpc\n\nThis value is closest to 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning for solving this problem involves two main steps:\n1.  **Determining the redshift (z) of the quasar.** The problem states there is a peak at 790 nm and a significant flux drop for shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line from a high-redshift object. The intergalactic medium absorbs light at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted Lyα line (this is known as the Gunn-Peterson trough). The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyα line is 121.567 nm. We can calculate the redshift using the formula:\n    1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n    z = (790 nm / 121.567 nm) - 1 ≈ 5.5\n\n2.  **Calculating the comoving distance.** For a flat Lambda-CDM universe (as specified, with Ω_matter + Ω_lambda = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1.0), the comoving distance D_C is calculated by integrating over the redshift. The formula is:\n    D_C = (c / H₀) ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')³ + Ω_Λ)\n\n    Where:\n    *   c = speed of light\n    *   H₀ = Hubble constant (70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹)\n    *   Ω_m = Matter density parameter (0.3)\n    *   Ω_Λ = Dark energy density parameter (0.7)\n    *   z = the redshift we calculated in step 1.\n\nThe Python code was set up to perform these calculations precisely.\n\nAccording to the output from the code execution:\n*   The calculated redshift is `z = 5.498...` (which is indeed ~5.5).\n*   The calculated comoving distance is `D_C = 8.02 Gpc`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8 Gpc\nB) 6 Gpc\nC) 7 Gpc\nD) 9 Gpc\n\nThe calculated value of 8.02 Gpc is closest to 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<A>>>"
