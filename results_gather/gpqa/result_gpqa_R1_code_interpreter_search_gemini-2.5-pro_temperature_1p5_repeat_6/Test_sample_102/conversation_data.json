    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   Bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions:\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n### 3. Key Chemical Principles to Consider\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (and Alkylation):** These reactions (like adding the -COCH₃ group) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, particularly those bearing a nitro group (-NO₂). This is a critical constraint.\n*   **Order of Reactions:** The order in which substituents are introduced is crucial for achieving the correct isomer.\n*   **Conflicting Directing Effects:** When multiple substituents are present, their directing effects must be considered together. Often, the most strongly activating group dominates, or in the case of multiple deactivating groups, the reaction occurs at the least deactivated position.\n*   **Diazotization-Deamination Sequence:** A sequence involving reduction of a nitro group to an amine (e.g., with Fe/HCl), followed by diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) and deamination (H₃PO₂), is used to remove an amino group. This is often employed as a strategy to overcome unfavorable directing effects by using the amino group as a temporary \"phantom\" director. However, in this case, the final product contains all meta-directing groups (or an o,p-director meta to the others), so such a complex route may not be the most straightforward.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (Deamination).\nThis sequence brings the starting material back to benzene after four steps, making the entire sequence illogical for synthesizing a complex product. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene. (-Br is o,p-director).\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product). The ring now has a -Br and a -NO₂ group.\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).\nThis step is the fatal flaw. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, and Friedel-Crafts acylation will not proceed under normal conditions. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**\nLet's trace this path carefully.\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   iii) Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → This reaction would primarily result in N-acylation to form acetanilide, not a Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring. The basic nitrogen atom complexes with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n*   If we assume acetanilide is formed, step (iv) would be bromination to yield p-bromoacetanilide. Following the entire sequence (which includes nitration and a missing hydrolysis step before diazotization/deamination) leads to 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is not the target molecule. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions:\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product, acetophenone, has a meta-directing acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This is a standard electrophilic bromination on a moderately deactivated ring.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, we have a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an o,p-director (-Br at C3).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   However, the acetyl group is a stronger deactivator than the bromo group. It strongly deactivates its ortho and para positions (2, 4, 6). Therefore, the electrophilic attack is most likely to occur at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group and least deactivated.\n    *   This reaction is known to produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in high yield.\n\nThe first three steps of option B constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) would modify the product and seem superfluous, likely an error in the question's formulation. However, compared to the other options which contain fundamental chemical errors (impossible reactions, wrong products, illogical sequences), the core synthesis presented in option B is correct. Therefore, it is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
