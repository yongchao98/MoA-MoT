    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to identify which of the given molecules exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept of optical isomerism.**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as a chiral axis (atropisomerism) or a chiral plane. A simple way to check for chirality is to look for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). If a molecule possesses either of these, it is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each molecule for chirality.**\n\n*   **Molecule 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with large groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   The steric bulk of these ortho substituents prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond. This restricted rotation forces the two phenyl rings into planes that are perpendicular to each other.\n    *   In this twisted conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral. This specific type of chirality due to hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is the one bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. We can identify the four groups attached to it:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral and therefore optically active. It will exist as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n*   **Molecule 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is diphenyl ketone, (C6H5)2CO. A central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The central carbon is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. We must check the molecule as a whole for symmetry. The molecule possesses a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, a plane of symmetry can be drawn that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of this plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry (σ). Additionally, there is a center of inversion (i) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate the results.**\n*   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only molecules 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
