To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe most distinguishing information comes from the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated, which is consistent with this data.\n*   **Key Signals:** The spectrum contains two particularly complex signals:\n    *   **Signal 1:** A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **Signal 2:** A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nTo have these multiplicities, a proton must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons.\n*   A **dtq** arises from a proton being split by:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (like a CH₂ group), giving the **t**riplet.\n    *   A group of three adjacent protons (like a CH₃ group), giving the **q**uartet.\n*   A **dtt** arises from a proton being split by:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (like a CH₂ group), giving the first **t**riplet.\n    *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (another CH₂ group), giving the second **t**riplet.\n\n### **3. Analyze Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton environment that would produce a `dtq` and another that would produce a `dtt`. Let's represent the structures by their IUPAC names derived from the condensed formulas.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(CH₃)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H at C4 (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3H, quartet). This proton would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to three neighbors consisting of one proton, two protons, and another two protons. Therefore, there is no `dtt` signal. Structure A is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(CH₃)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C4 (1H, doublet), H at C2 (2H, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3H, quartet). This proton would be a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Like structure A, there is no proton environment that would lead to a `dtt` signal. Structure C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(Et)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), H at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This proton would be a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt** (doublet of triplets), not a `dtq`. Since there is no `dtq` signal, structure D is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃(5)-CH(Et)(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    Let's examine the two methine (CH) protons on the main chain, at C3 and C4.\n    *   **Proton at C4**: It is adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the ethyl group at C4 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the methyl group at C5 (3H) → quartet (q)\n        The multiplicity is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: It is also adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        2.  The protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        3.  The protons of the ethyl group at C3 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        The multiplicity is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure B is the only candidate that has protons matching both the `dtq` and `dtt` signals described in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
