    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`: This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a tetrahydropyran skeleton) and a carbonyl group at the C2 position. This is a cyclic ester, specifically a δ-lactone.\n*   `4-ethyl`: An ethyl group is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   This C4 carbon, being attached to four different groups (H, ethyl, and two different paths around the ring), is a chiral center.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nSix-membered (δ) lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids.\nThe structure of our lactone product implies its precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n`HO-CH₂(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The resulting lactone has the ethyl group at C4 (which corresponds to C3 of the acid precursor). The stereochemistry at this chiral center is not altered during the lactonization process. Therefore, an (R)-precursor will form an (R)-lactone, and an (S)-precursor will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide isomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's deduce its structure:\n*   `pentanoic acid`: The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at the end of a five-carbon chain. Let's number the chain C1 to C5, with C1 being the carboxylic acid carbon.\n    `C(5)-C(4)-C(3)-C(2)-C(1)OOH`\n*   `3-ethyl`: An ethyl group is on C3.\n*   `5-oxo` and `5-isobutoxy`: This indicates that C5 has both an oxo (`=O`) and an isobutoxy (`-O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) group. This combination describes an isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-iBu`).\n*   Combining these pieces, the structure is a pentanedioic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other (C5).\n\nStarting Material Structure: `iBu-OOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)` (where the numbers in parentheses denote the position relative to the carboxylic acid C1). The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by `LiBH₄`.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutoxy part becomes isobutanol (`iBu-OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged (as a lithium carboxylate salt).\n    3.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) protonates the carboxylate back to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Intermediate:** The reaction produces `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)`\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the reduction and subsequent cyclization do not affect the stereocenter at C3, the configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (`BH₃`) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate hydroxy-ester: `iBu-OOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-CH₂OH(1)`.\n    4.  Under the reaction conditions (or during acidic workup), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the cyclic lactone.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** The attacking `OH` is on C1 (now `CH₂OH`) and the ester is at C5. This also results in the formation of the same `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` system which cyclizes. Let's trace the ring formation more carefully: the intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. The `OH` at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl at C1. This forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction pathway also does not involve the chiral center at C3, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
