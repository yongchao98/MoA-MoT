    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a ketone or aldehyde to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyzing cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring containing three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to the adjacent carbonyl groups. Each of these α-carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Since it possesses α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It tautomerizes to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable enol form. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent (α) to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. However, these carbons are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). They are sp²-hybridized and do not have the typical α-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon that are required for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Lacking the necessary α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula can be written as CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  An ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Optical Isomerism:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *does* show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the trans isomer of dimethyl butenedioate: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The two ester groups (-COOCH₃) are on opposite sides of the central C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms in the molecule bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar around the double bond and possesses a center of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   **Optical Isomerism:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and therefore does *not* show optical isomerism. (It does show geometric isomerism, with its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate).\n\n4.  **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer determination:**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
