    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V = 0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. To solve this problem, we use the \"method of images\". This method replaces the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The position and magnitude of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero, matching the condition of the grounded sphere.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nThrough standard derivation, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center of the sphere are found to be:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   The charge is opposite in sign to `q`, which makes sense as it creates an attractive force.\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   The image charge is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge `q`. Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located inside the sphere.\n\nNow, the system of the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere is electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\nThe force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\nThe distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\nThe force of attraction between them is:\n`F = k * |q*q'| / (d-b)^2`\n\nHowever, as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity, the position (`b`) and magnitude (`q'`) of the image charge change. The work done is the integral of the force from infinity to `d`.\n`U = W = ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`\nwhere `x` is the variable distance from the center.\nThe force at any distance `x` is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\nIntegrating this gives the potential energy:\n`U = ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = [ (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (x^2 - R^2) ]_∞^d`\n`U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) - 0 = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nWait, the force is attractive, so the potential energy should be negative. The work done *by the field* is positive, so the potential energy (work done against the field) is negative.\n`U = -W_field = -(Work done by attractive force)`\nThe correct potential energy calculation yields:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula `U = (1/2) qV`**\nA more direct method uses the general formula for electrostatic energy `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For a point charge in the presence of conductors, this simplifies to finding the potential *at the location of the charge* due to all *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n1.  **Potential at location `d` due to the sphere:** This is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   The potential at `d` from the image charge is `V_image = k * q' / (d-b)`.\n    *   `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy:** The interaction energy between the charge `q` and the induced charge distribution has a factor of 1/2. This is because the induced charge distribution itself is dependent on `q`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBoth methods yield the same result for the potential energy of the system:\n`U = -(1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option D. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the potential energy of the system is lower than when the charge is at infinity (U=0).\n\n<<<D>>>"
