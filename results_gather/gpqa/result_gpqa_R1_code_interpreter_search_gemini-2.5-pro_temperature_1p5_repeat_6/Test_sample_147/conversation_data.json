    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the information about compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFₓ) with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). We can set up an equation to find the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) in terms of x, the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (M(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nSolving for M(Y):\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00x) = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724x = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe need to find an integer `x` for which `40.45 * x` corresponds to the molar mass of a known element.\n\n*   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08)\n*   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br=79.90)\n*   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb=121.76)\n*   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (Closest is Dysprosium, Dy=162.50)\n*   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest is Bismuth, Bi=208.98 or Mercury, Hg=200.59)\n*   If x = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu=244 or Americium, Am=243)\n\n**Step 2: Use other clues to identify Element Y and its fluorides.**\n\nWe have several other important pieces of information:\n1.  **Five binary compounds** of Y and F are known.\n2.  **A1 is bright-red**, decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and F₂, and oxidizes xenon (Xe) under normal conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates for Y from Step 1:\n*   **Bromine (Br)**: Forms BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅ (3 compounds, not 5). Rule out.\n*   **Antimony (Sb)**: Forms SbF₃, SbF₅ (2 compounds, not 5). Rule out.\n*   **Plutonium (Pu)**: A good candidate from the mass calculation (M(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol for x=6). PuF₆ is a strong oxidizing agent (can oxidize Xe) and is reddish-brown (\"bright-red\" is plausible). It decomposes to PuF₄ and F₂. However, only three binary fluorides of Pu are well-known (PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₆), not five.\n*   Let's check the element that is most famous for having five binary fluorides: **Uranium (U)**. The known binary fluorides are UF₃, UF₄, U₂F₉ (or UF₄.₅), UF₅, and UF₆. This fits the \"five compounds\" clue perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Verify if Y = Uranium fits the scenario.**\n\n*   **A2 = UF₆**: Let's check the mass fraction of F in UF₆. M(U) ≈ 238 g/mol.\n    ɷF(UF₆) = (6 * 19) / (238 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 352 = 0.3238 or 32.38%.\n    This is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy (~1.3% relative error) is common in such problems due to rounding of atomic masses. So, we can confidently identify **A2 as UF₆**.\n\n*   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (UF₆) and F₂. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride than UF₆. No stable binary uranium fluoride above UF₆ is known. However, the problem describes A1 as highly unstable (\"decomposes at 293 K\"). Also, A1 is \"bright-red\" and oxidizes Xe under \"normal conditions\". This description perfectly matches **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**.\n    *   KrF₂ is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known and readily oxidizes Xe.\n    *   It decomposes slowly at room temperature (293 K).\n    *   Some reports describe solid KrF₂ as having a reddish appearance at low temperatures.\n    The reaction is a complex fluorination, not a simple decomposition:\n    U + 3 KrF₂ → UF₆ + 3 Kr\n    Although A1 (KrF₂) is not a compound of Y, it is the reagent used to produce A2 (UF₆). The wording \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine\" might be a slightly simplified or misleading description of a complex reaction where KrF₂ acts as a fluorine source to create UF₆. Given the other constraints, this is the most logical interpretation.\n\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y with fluorine, and it can interact with Xenon.\n    Y + F₂ → A3. A3 interacts with Xe.\n    U + 3F₂ → UF₆. As established, UF₆ (A2) can react with Xe, so A3 could be UF₆. This aligns.\n\n**Step 4: Identify A4 and A5.**\n\n*   We are given the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** (in a 1:1 molar ratio, in a hot concentrated solution).\n*   In our case: **U + A4 → A5**\n*   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n\nLet's consider the possible identities of A4 and A5 from the known chemistry of uranium fluorides. A common reaction in aqueous uranium chemistry involves the disproportionation of U(V) compounds or comproportionation reactions.\nA key reaction involves the uranyl ion, (UO₂)²⁺. Let's consider A4 to be an aqueous acid of the uranyl ion. The most common is Uranyl fluoride, UO₂F₂ dissolved in hydrofluoric acid (HF). Uranyl fluoride itself is a colorless substance in solution.\nSo, let's assume **A4 is UO₂F₂**.\n\nThe reaction is:\nU + UO₂F₂ (+ other reagents, likely HF) → A5\n\nA known comproportionation reaction is:\nU(s) + UO₂²⁺(aq) + 4H⁺(aq) → 2U⁴⁺(aq) + 2H₂O(l)\n\nIf we use hydrofluoric acid, the product U⁴⁺ will precipitate as UF₄ (uranium tetrafluoride).\nLet's check the stoichiometry:\nU + UO₂F₂ + 4HF → 2UF₄ + 2H₂O\nThis is a balanced reaction. Here, Y (U) and A4 (UO₂F₂) react in a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction.\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe solution likely contains more than just A4. Let's assume A4 is a uranium compound where uranium is in a +6 oxidation state, like UF₆ or UO₂F₂. The element Y is uranium in oxidation state 0. They react to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state. A5 decomposes in water. This is characteristic of U(V) compounds.\n\nA plausible reaction involves forming a U(V) complex:\nU(0) + UF₆ (in HF solution) → Formation of U(V) species.\nHowever, a more direct comproportionation is:\nU(0) + 3UF₆ → 4UF₄(V) -> this is incorrect.\nU(IV) + U(VI) -> 2U(V). Example: UF₄ + UF₆ -> 2UF₅\nThis doesn't involve element Y (Uranium metal).\n\nLet's go back to the aqueous chemistry involving uranyl ions.\nPerhaps A4 is nitric acid, HNO₃, a colorless concentrated solution. Uranyl nitrate UO₂(NO₃)₂ is formed, which is colorless to pale yellow. This doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's stick with the most plausible candidate for an aqueous uranium(VI) solution: **UO₂F₂ in HF**. The stoichiometry might be complex. The key information is that **A4 is a colorless solution containing a uranium(VI) compound**. UO₂F₂ is the most logical choice.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Uranyl Fluoride, UO₂F₂.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight:\nM(U) ≈ 238.03 g/mol\nM(O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\nM(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of UO₂F₂ = M(U) + 2 * M(O) + 2 * M(F)\nMW = 238.03 + 2 * 16.00 + 2 * 19.00\nMW = 238.03 + 32.00 + 38.00\nMW = **308.03 g/mol**\n\nThis falls into none of the given ranges. Let me re-check my deductions. Everything points strongly to Uranium. The A4 identification seems the most likely weak point.\n\nLet's revisit the core, confirmed facts: Y=U, A2=UF₆.\nWhat else could A4 be? \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Y is added to it.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nU + A4 -> A5\n\nMaybe A4 is a non-uranium compound? This is unlikely, given the context. The problem revolves around the compounds of Y.\nLet's rethink the reaction.\nA5 decomposes in water into two substances.\nWhat if A4 is a U(IV) compound, and it gets reduced? Unlikely.\nWhat if the reaction is not aqueous? \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This could mean a non-aqueous solvent.\nFor example, UF₆ can be dissolved in anhydrous HF. This solution is colorless.\nReaction: U + UF₆ (in HF) -> A5.\nThis reaction does not proceed in a simple 1:1 stoichiometry to a single product.\n\nThere might be an error in my reasoning or the problem statement has a twist. Let's reconsider all fluorides of uranium as A4.\n- UF₃: black/purple solid.\n- UF₄: green solid.\n- U₂F₉: black solid.\n- UF₅: blue/gray solid.\n- UF₆: colorless solid, sublimes. A solution in HF is colorless.\n- UO₂F₂: colorless in solution.\nIf \"solution of A4\" implies that A4 is the solute, both UF₆ and UO₂F₂ are candidates.\nMW(UF₆) = 352.03 g/mol.\nMW(UO₂F₂) = 308.03 g/mol.\nNeither fit the ranges perfectly.\n\nLet's re-examine the given answer ranges:\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nCould Y be a different element? The \"five fluorides\" points overwhelmingly to Uranium. The mass calculation for A2 fits UF₆ well. The properties of A1 are tricky but can be reconciled. It's highly probable that Y=Uranium.\n\nLet's think of another compound for A4. What if the description \"colorless concentrated solution\" is key. A solution of Uranium(IV) fluoride, UF₄, in certain complexing agents can be colorless. But UF₄ itself is a green solid.\n\nThere must be a compound of Uranium whose mass is in one of those ranges.\nLet's check Uranium oxides, chlorides, etc.\n- UO₃: 238 + 3*16 = 286\n- UO₂: 238 + 2*16 = 270\n- UCl₄: 238 + 4*35.5 = 238 + 142 = 380\n- UCl₆: 238 + 6*35.5 = 238 + 213 = 451\n\nThere is another possibility. The \"Y\" in the final reaction \"Y+A4->A5\" might not be the element Uranium, but one of its compounds, like UF₄. This contradicts the problem stating \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio...\".\n\nLet's reconsider the mass of Y. What if the given ɷF=31.96% for A2=YFₓ is exact?\nFrom M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x:\n- x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8\n- x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3\n- x=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 (closest is Pu)\n\nLet's try Y = Neptunium (Np, M=237). Np is between U and Pu.\nɷF(NpF₆) = (6*19)/(237+114) = 114/351 = 32.47%. Still very close to ɷF(UF₆).\nNp also has multiple fluorides (NpF₃, NpF₄, NpF₆). Not five.\n\nThe evidence for Y=Uranium remains the strongest. Let's assume A4 is a simple, common compound that has been missed.\nLet's look for a Uranium compound with MW in the range 220-240.\nThis would have to be U + (something with negative mass) or a very light adduct. This is impossible.\n\nLet's rethink \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". What if Y is not a metal? What if Y=Iodine?\nIodine (I, M=126.9). Forms IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇. Four compounds, close to five.\nLet's check mass fractions. A2=IFₓ, ɷF=31.96%\nM(I)=126.9. M(Y)= (x*19/0.3196) - 19x = 40.45x\n126.9 = 40.45x -> x=3.13. Close to x=3.\nLet's check ɷF(IF₃) = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 31.0%. Close to 31.96%.\nSo, maybe Y=Iodine and A2=IF₃.\nA1 decomposes to A2(IF₃) + F₂ -> A1=IF₅.\nLet's check properties of IF₅: Colorless liquid. Doesn't fit \"bright-red\".\nSo Y is not Iodine.\n\nThe entire logical chain leads back to Uranium. There must be an interpretation of A4 that gives a MW in one of the ranges.\nLet's try one more time. Is there any other Uranium compound? What about Uranium(IV) borohydride U(BH₄)₄? MW = 238 + 4*(10.8+4) = 238 + 59.2 = 297.2. No.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: U(metal) + A4 -> A5.\nMaybe A4 is an oxoacid?\nH₂SO₄? HNO₃? HClO₄? These are all colorless.\nU + HNO₃ -> UO₂(NO₃)₂. A4 would be HNO₃, MW=63. Not in range.\nU + HClO₄ -> .... complex. MW(HClO₄) = 100.5.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and A4 is **Uranium trioxide, UO₃**.\nMW = 238 + 3*16 = 286. Still not in range.\nHow about **Uranium(IV) oxide, UO₂**? MW = 238 + 32 = 270.\nMaybe the question meant \"atomic weight of Y\"? M(U)=238, which is in the range 220-240. But it asks for MW of A4.\n\nLet's assume the question and ranges are correct and my identification of Y is wrong, despite the strong evidence.\nLet A4's MW be `M`.\n- A) M ∈ [140, 160].\n- B) M ∈ [110, 130].\n- C) M ∈ [220, 240].\n- D) M ∈ [160, 180].\n\nLet's try Y=Tellurium (Te, M=127.6). It forms TeF₄, TeF₆, and Te₂F₁₀. Not five.\nCheck ɷF for TeF₄: (4*19)/(127.6+76) = 76/203.6 = 37.3%.\nCheck ɷF for TeF₆: (6*19)/(127.6+114) = 114/241.6 = 47.2%. Not a match.\n\nThe weight of evidence for Y=U is too strong to ignore. Let's reconsider the molecular weight calculation.\nMaybe A4 is UOCl₂? MW = 238 + 16 + 2*35.5 = 254+71 = 325. No.\nUranium(IV) chloride, UCl₄? MW = 380. No.\nUF₄? MW = 238 + 4*19 = 314. No.\nWhat if Y is Pu? M=244. PuF₄ MW=320.\nPuO₂ MW = 244 + 32 = 276.\n\nLet's take a leap of faith based on the strong evidence for Y=Uranium. M(U) ≈ 238 g/mol. The question asks for the molecular weight of A4. If A4 is somehow element Y itself, then its atomic weight is 238, which lies in the range 220-240. But A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\", which cannot be a solid metal. However, sometimes in abstract problems, terms are used loosely. For example, if A4 was meant to be the elementary substance Y, U-238, its molar mass fits range C.\nLet's see if this interpretation makes any sense.\nY + Y -> A5? This is nonsensical.\n\nLet's go back to the most likely candidate: UF₄. Maybe my calculation is wrong. M(U) is 238.0289. M(F) is 18.9984. UF₄ = 238.0289 + 4*18.9984 = 314.02. This is not in any range.\n\nLet's review the prompt. This appears to be a problem from a chemistry olympiad or a similar high-level competition. These problems are usually self-consistent. The convergence on Y=Uranium is very strong. Let's trust this and see if A4 can be found. The reaction U + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio) is the only piece of information about A4. A known reaction is UF₄ + UF₆ -> 2UF₅. This is a 1:1 reaction. Could Y be UF₄ and A4 be UF₆? This redefines Y mid-problem. That's not right.\n\nThere is a possibility that Y is not a single element but represents a group, but the term \"element Y\" contradicts this.\n\nLet's assume Y = Pu. Then A2 could be PuF₆. ɷF = (6*19)/(244+114) = 114/358 = 31.84%. This is an excellent match for 31.96%.\nSo, **Y = Plutonium (Pu)**.\nA1 decomposes to A2 (PuF₆) and F₂. Again, this suggests A1 is a higher fluoride, which isn't known. Or A1=PuF₆ and it decomposes to PuF₄+F₂. This would make A2=PuF₄. ɷF(PuF₄) = (4*19)/(244+76) = 76/320 = 23.75%. This is not 31.96%.\nSo, A2 must be PuF₆. This means A1 decomposes to PuF₆ + F₂. The only way this works is if it's not a simple decomposition, similar to the KrF₂ + U -> UF₆ + Kr scenario.\n\nLet's proceed with Y=Pu, A2=PuF₆.\n- Five binary compounds of Pu and F? No, only three are known. This is a major contradiction.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, the Uranium hypothesis with the five fluorides seems more robust, even with the small mass fraction discrepancy for UF₆. The most likely source of error is either in the description of the reaction for A4 or A4 itself is an unusual compound. Let's reconsider the molecular weight of Uranium itself: 238 g/mol. It falls in range C. If A4 is a placeholder name for the Y substance used as a reagent, this might be the intended answer, however strange the phrasing.\nIf A4 = UF₆, MW = 352.\nIf A4 = UO₂F₂, MW = 308.\nIf A4 = UF₄, MW = 314.\nIf A4 = UF₅, MW = 333.\nNone of these fit the provided options.\n\nThere must be another compound. What about uranium peroxide, UO₄·2H₂O? This compound is pale yellow. MW = 238 + 4*16 + 2*18 = 302 + 36 = 338.\nThere is no clear path to a compound that fits one of the molecular weight ranges. Let's reconsider the mass calculation. Perhaps x=4? M(Y) = 161.8. No element fits well.\n\nLet's assume the question implies Y is Iodine, since it is a well-known element forming many interhalogen compounds.\nY=I, A2=IF₃. A1=IF₅.\nI + A4 -> A5 (1:1). A5 decomposes in water. A4 is colorless.\nA possible reaction: I₂ + 5F₂ -> 2IF₅.\nA3 is obtained by fluorination: I₂ + F₂ -> 2IF. A3=IF. It can interact with Xe to form complexes.\nSo far, plausible except for the color of A1(IF₅) being colorless, not red.\nWhat could A4 be? Let's check iodine compounds.\nHI: MW=128 (in range B). HIO₃: MW=176 (in range D). HIO₄: MW=192 (not in range).\nReaction: I + HIO₃ -> ? In a 1:1 molar ratio, this could be the comproportionation reaction: 5I⁻ + IO₃⁻ + 6H⁺ -> 3I₂ + 3H₂O. Not Y + A4.\nMaybe I₂ + I₂O₅ -> I₂O₃+I₂O₂ ?\n\nThis path is not yielding a clear result and has contradictions. The Uranium path is the most coherent despite the issues with A4's identity. The atomic mass of Uranium (238 g/mol) falls in range C (220-240). Given the high probability that Y is Uranium and the ambiguity/potential error in the description of A4 and its reaction, it is a strong possibility that the question is indirectly asking for a property of Y itself. If A4 is a simple compound of Y, its mass would be M(Y) + other atoms, so M(A4) > M(Y) = 238. Thus A4 should be >238. None of the ranges A, B, D work. Range C is the only one that is even close to the scale of M(Y). If we assume A4 = UO₂ (Uranium dioxide), its mass is 270 g/mol, outside of C.\n\nLet's go with the Pu=Y hypothesis again, as the mass calculation is a better fit. Y=Pu, A2=PuF₆. We must ignore the \"five fluorides\" rule. A1 oxidizes Xe, reddish -> PuF₆. Okay. A3 fluorination product that interacts with Xe -> PuF₆. A5 from Pu + A4. A4 is a colorless solution. PuF₄ is pinkish. Plutonyl solutions (PuO₂²⁺) are pink-orange. Only Pu³⁺ is blue/violet. It's hard to find a colorless solution for A4. But if we ignore that, maybe A4=PuO₂? MW=276. Out of range. Maybe A4 = PuCl₃? MW = 244 + 3*35.5 = 349.5. No.\n\nThe most plausible scenario remains Y=U. The discrepancy in F% is small. The five fluorides rule is unique. The difficulty is in A4. If we are forced to choose an answer, and knowing Y=U, the only mass range that is \"in the ballpark\" for a heavy element like Uranium is C. If we hypothesize that A4 is an obscure or misdescribed compound, whose mass happens to fall in that range, this is a possible path. There is no simple, common uranium compound that fits the mass range. But the identity of Y=Uranium is the most solid conclusion from the premises. Based on this, it's a process of elimination on the MW ranges. A compound of U will be heavy. A, B, and D are too light. A compound of U could plausibly be in range C, for example, if it were something like UF₂ (hypothetical), MW=238+38=276, still outside. Or UO (hypothetical), MW=238+16=254. Again outside. The range C contains the atomic mass of Y itself. This might be a hint.\n\nLet's choose C, based on the high likelihood that Y is Uranium, and range C is the only plausible range for the mass of a heavy element compound (or the element itself).\n\n<<<C>>>"
