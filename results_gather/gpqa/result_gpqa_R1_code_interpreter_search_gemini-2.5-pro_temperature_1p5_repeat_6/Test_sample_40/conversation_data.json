    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S) is `v`. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   The speed of light *inside* the glass is defined by the index of refraction, `n`. The formula for the index of refraction is `n = c / u_medium`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum and `u_medium` is the speed of light in the medium. In our case, this `u_medium` is the speed of the light beam as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the glass. Let's call this `u'`.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in vacuum `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of the light beam relative to the glass frame (S') is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Since the speeds are relativistic (involving the speed of light), we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, not the classical Galilean one. The formula for adding two velocities `v` and `u'` that are in the same direction is:\n\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u') / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `v` = velocity of the glass.\n    *   `u'` = velocity of light in the glass = `1 / n`.\n    *   `c` = speed of light in vacuum = `1`.\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + (v * (1/n)) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + n*(1/n)) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n    Rearranging the terms in the numerator to match the given options:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our derived expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
