    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n### **1. Observability Criteria**\n\nTo be observed by both instruments, a star must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  **Visibility**: It must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory (home of ESPRESSO) and the W. M. Keck Observatory (home of HIRES).\n2.  **Brightness**: Its apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be bright enough for both spectrographs.\n\n### **2. Visibility Analysis**\n\nA celestial object is visible from an observatory if its declination (DEC) is within the observable range from that location. The observable declination range for an observatory at latitude `lat` is from `lat - 90°` to `+90°` in the northern hemisphere and from `-90°` to `lat + 90°` in the southern hemisphere.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):**\n    *   Location: Atacama Desert, Chile.\n    *   Latitude: approximately -24.6° S.\n    *   Observable Declination Range: from -90° to (-24.6° + 90°) = +65.4°.\n    *   So, for Paranal, **DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):**\n    *   Location: Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA.\n    *   Latitude: approximately +19.8° N.\n    *   Observable Declination Range: from (19.8° - 90°) = -70.2° to +90°.\n    *   So, for Keck, **DEC > -70.2°**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must be within the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **3. Brightness Analysis**\n\nThe apparent V magnitude (m_V) of the star must be within the limits of both instruments.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit**: m_V < 17 mag.\n*   **HIRES Limit**: m_V < 16 mag.\n\nTo be observable by *both*, the stricter limit applies. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **m_V < 16 mag**.\n\n### **4. Calculating Apparent Magnitudes**\n\nWe need to find the apparent V magnitude (m_V) for each star. The relationship between apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and absorption (A) is given by the distance modulus formula:\n`m = M - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A`\nwhere `d` is in parsecs (pc).\n\n### **5. Star-by-Star Evaluation**\n\nLet's evaluate each star based on the criteria for visibility and brightness.\n\n**Star 1**\n*   DEC = -75°\n*   **Visibility**: Fails. The declination (-75°) is outside the range for Keck (DEC > -70.2°).\n*   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   DEC = +55°\n*   **Visibility**: Passes. -70.2° < 55° < +65.4°.\n*   m_V = 16.5 mag\n*   **Brightness**: Fails. 16.5 is not less than 16.\n*   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   DEC = +48°\n*   **Visibility**: Passes. -70.2° < 48° < +65.4°.\n*   m_V = 15.5 mag\n*   **Brightness**: Passes. 15.5 < 16.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   DEC = -48°\n*   **Visibility**: Passes. -70.2° < -48° < +65.4°.\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n*   Color Excess E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   Absorption (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n*   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A_V\n    `m_V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24`\n    `m_V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * 1 + 1.24 = 16.74`\n*   **Brightness**: Fails. 16.74 is not less than 16.\n*   **Conclusion**: Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   DEC = +60°\n*   **Visibility**: Passes. -70.2° < 60° < +65.4°.\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n*   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n*   No absorption mentioned, so A_V = 0.\n*   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A_V\n    `m_V = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) + 0`\n    `m_V = 11.5 + 5 * 0.69897 ≈ 11.5 + 3.49 = 14.99`\n*   **Brightness**: Passes. 14.99 < 16.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Observable by both.**\n\n### **Final Result**\n\nThe stars that satisfy both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories are **Star 3** and **Star 5**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
