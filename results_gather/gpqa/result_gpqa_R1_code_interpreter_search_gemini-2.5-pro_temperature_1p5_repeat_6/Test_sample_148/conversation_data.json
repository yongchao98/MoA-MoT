    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most likely explanation for the experimental observations.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Data**\n\n*   **Observation 1: 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **Two peaks for the same alpha-proton:** This immediately suggests the proton exists in two distinct chemical environments.\n    *   **Similar chemical shifts:** The environments are similar but not identical.\n    *   **Roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H):** This indicates that the two species responsible for these two environments are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Spin-spin coupling is ruled out:** This is a crucial detail. The splitting is not due to coupling with adjacent protons. We are looking at two separate, non-coupled signals (singlets, or perhaps two identical multiplets if the alpha-proton is coupled to something else like beta-protons, but the point is there are two distinct *sets* of signals for this proton).\n\n*   **Observation 2: LC-MS Analysis**\n    *   **Elevated temperature:** This might be relevant for separating species that interconvert, like rotamers, but it doesn't fundamentally change the interpretation of the other data points.\n    *   **Two clearly defined peaks:** The sample contains two different compounds that can be separated by chromatography.\n    *   **Equal intensities:** This confirms the ~1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n    *   **Same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule:** This is the most critical piece of information from the MS. Both separable compounds are isomers of the target molecule; they have the same molecular weight and fragmentation pattern. This rules out impurities with a different chemical formula (like precursors or side-products with different masses).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. By definition, they have identical physical properties (melting point, boiling point, solubility) in an achiral environment.\n    *   Standard NMR uses achiral solvents, so enantiomers are indistinguishable and give identical spectra. You would see only one set of peaks.\n    *   Standard LC uses an achiral stationary phase, so enantiomers are not separated and would elute as a single peak.\n    *   This option contradicts both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate in the synthesis. It would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and thus a different mass.\n    *   The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the final product.\n    *   This option is directly contradicted by the MS data.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This side reaction involves the addition of an extra amino acid residue. For example, instead of synthesizing Peptide-A-B, you might get Peptide-A-B-B.\n    *   This product would have a higher molecular weight than the target molecule.\n    *   Again, this is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the expected mass.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more stereocenters, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them.\n    *   **NMR Compatibility:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties. They are chemically distinct and will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have slightly different chemical shifts. This perfectly explains the observation of two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC chromatogram. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which explains why both peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n    *   **Plausibility in Synthesis:** In peptide synthesis, a common side reaction is the epimerization (racemization) of the alpha-carbon of an activated amino acid during the coupling step. For example, coupling an L-amino acid could result in a mixture of the desired L,L-peptide and the undesired D,L-peptide. These two products are diastereomers and fit all the observations perfectly. The 1:1 ratio suggests significant epimerization occurred. Another possibility is the presence of cis/trans isomers about a proline amide bond, which are also a type of diastereomer (atropisomers) and are separable by NMR and LC.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence strongly points to the presence of a diastereomeric mixture. The NMR data shows two distinct chemical environments for the same proton, and the LC-MS data confirms the presence of two separable compounds that are isomers of each other. This scenario is a common and well-understood outcome in chemical peptide synthesis due to side reactions like epimerization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
