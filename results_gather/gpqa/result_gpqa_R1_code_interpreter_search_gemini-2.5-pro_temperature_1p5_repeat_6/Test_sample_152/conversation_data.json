These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The α-hydrogens between the two carbonyl groups are acidic. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Its structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate, [CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻, attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This creates another enolate intermediate, which is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   The nucleophile `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` adds to the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n           COOCH₃\n            |\n        (p-Tolyl)-CH - CH₂ - COOCH₃\n                  |\n             CH(COOCH₃)₂\n        ```\n    *   This structure can be seen as a propane chain with substituents. To name it according to the options, we identify the main chain and substituents. The name \"propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" implies a propane backbone where carbons 1 and 3 have carboxylate groups.\n    *   Let's analyze the name **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**:\n        *   Parent: Propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate suggests a chain: (MeOOC)CH₂ – CH – CH(COOMe)₂\n        *   Substituent: A p-tolyl group at position 2.\n        *   Structure from name: (MeOOC)CH₂ – CH(p-Tolyl) – CH(COOMe)₂\n    *   This structure matches the one derived from our reaction mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a carbon nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the parent ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Reagents:** The initial reaction occurs in methanol (MeOH). The subsequent workup with H₃O⁺ is crucial for hydrolyzing the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion and a resonance-stabilized nitrile anion.\n    *   The anion is protonated.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt, regenerating the carbonyl group (ketone) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the cyclohexanone ring system attacks the β-carbon (`-CH(CH₃)-`) of the acceptor.\n    *   The acceptor's α-carbon becomes `-CH₂-CN` after protonation.\n    *   The new substituent on the cyclohexane ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. This substituent is at the α-position (C2) relative to the carbonyl group.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at C2.\n    *   To name this product, we consider the butanenitrile as the parent chain: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n    *   The substituent is at position 3, and it is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns and unknowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C (unknown).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent at C2.\n    *   The substituent is a `-(3-oxobutyl)` group: `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the acceptor (MVK) adds a fragment to the donor. Let's see what fragment MVK provides. Upon reaction, the `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃` molecule becomes a `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃` saturated chain attached to the donor.\n    *   Comparing this to the substituent in the product (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`), we see they are the same (note: the IUPAC numbering '3-oxo' is based on the full substituent name, not the α,β positions of the acceptor).\n\n3.  **Determine Reactant C:**\n    *   The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The bond is formed between the C2 of the dione ring (the α-carbon between two carbonyls) and the `CH₂` group of the incoming `3-oxobutyl` chain.\n    *   To find the donor C, we can conceptually break this newly formed C-C bond and remove the fragment that came from the acceptor.\n    *   Removing the `-(3-oxobutyl)` group from C2 of `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione` leaves behind the donor molecule.\n    *   The donor molecule is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons at C2 are acidic, making it an excellent Michael donor in the presence of a base like KOH.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
