    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $T_2 / T_1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Information:**\n    *   Two star-planet systems.\n    *   Star masses are equal: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n    *   Planet masses are similar (assumed equal): $M_{planet,1} = M_{planet,2}$.\n    *   Orbits are circular.\n    *   The detection method is Radial Velocity (RV).\n    *   The \"periodic wavelength shift\" is a measure of the star's wobble. The maximum value of this shift is given for each system.\n        *   System 1: Maximum shift $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms.\n        *   System 2: Maximum shift $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n\n3.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The RV method measures the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_{r,star}$). This velocity causes a Doppler shift in the light from the star.\n    *   The relationship between the change in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) and the radial velocity is given by the Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{r,star}}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The \"up to X miliangstroms\" shift corresponds to the *amplitude* of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$. This occurs when the star is moving fastest towards or away from us.\n    *   This maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    *   From the Doppler formula, $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship Between Radial Velocity Amplitude ($K_{star}$) and Orbital Period (T):**\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:\n        $\\frac{G M_{star} M_{planet}}{a^2} = \\frac{M_{planet} v_{planet}^2}{a}$\n        where $a$ is the orbital radius and $v_{planet}$ is the planet's orbital speed.\n    *   The star also orbits the common center of mass. By conservation of momentum: $M_{star} v_{star} = M_{planet} v_{planet}$.\n    *   The amplitude of the star's observed radial velocity, $K_{star}$, is $v_{star}$ (assuming the orbit is viewed edge-on, an assumption that cancels out in a ratio).\n    *   So, $K_{star} = v_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} v_{planet}$.\n    *   We need to express this in terms of the orbital period, T. Let's use Kepler's Third Law. The problem states that the planets are in orbit around their host stars, so for the planet's orbit: $T = \\frac{2\\pi a}{v_{planet}}$. This means $v_{planet} = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$.\n    *   Substitute this into the expression for $K_{star}$:\n        $K_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi a}{T} \\right)$.\n    *   Now, use Kepler's Third Law to eliminate the orbital radius 'a'. For a planet, where $M_{star} \\gg M_{planet}$:\n        $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_{star}} a^3 \\implies a^3 = \\frac{G M_{star} T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\implies a = \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   Substitute this expression for 'a' back into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n        $K_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Let's simplify this expression to see how $K_{star}$ depends on $T$:\n        $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot (T^2)^{1/3} = \\frac{T^{2/3}}{T} = T^{-1/3}$.\n    *   So, the key relationship is: $K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$, given that all other parameters ($M_{star}$, $M_{planet}$) are the same.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    *   We have the relationship: $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   We know $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n    *   So, $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   To solve for the ratio we want, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, first cube both sides:\n        $\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n    *   Now, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$.\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   I will use a simple python script to calculate the value of $(5/7)^3$.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\n# The ratio T2/T1 is equal to (5/7)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3644.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options:\n        A) ~ 1.96\n        B) ~ 1.40\n        C) ~ 0.85\n        D) ~ 0.36\n    *   The calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",

This method measures the Doppler shift of the star's light caused by its \"wobble\" as the planet orbits it.\n    *   **Given Information:**\n        *   Star masses are equal: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n        *   Planet masses are similar (assumed equal): $M_{p1} = M_{p2}$.\n        *   Orbits are circular.\n        *   System 1: Max wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms.\n        *   System 2: Max wavelength shift $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula relates wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) to radial velocity ($v_r$): $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    *   Therefore, $K_{star} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   From this, we can find the ratio of the star's velocity amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship Between Velocity Amplitude ($K_{star}$) and Orbital Period (T):**\n    *   For a star-planet system, conservation of momentum gives: $M_p v_p = M_s v_s$, where $v_p$ and $v_s$ are the orbital velocities of the planet and star, respectively, around the common center of mass.\n    *   The amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K_{star}$, is effectively $v_s$ (assuming we are viewing the system edge-on, an assumption that will cancel out in the ratio). So, $K_s = \\frac{M_p}{M_s} v_p$.\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity is $v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$, where 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital radius for a circular orbit) and T is the orbital period.\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for $K_s$: $K_s = \\frac{M_p}{M_s} \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$.\n    *   We need to eliminate 'a'. We use Kepler's Third Law. For a planet orbiting a much more massive star ($M_s \\gg M_p$), the law is: $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3$.\n    *   Solving for 'a': $a = \\left( \\frac{G M_s T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   Now substitute this 'a' back into the equation for $K_s$:\n        $K_s = \\frac{M_p}{M_s} \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\left( \\frac{G M_s T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   Let's simplify and see the proportionality. All terms like $M_p, M_s, G, \\pi$ are constants in this comparison because the planet masses and star masses are equal for both systems.\n        $K_s \\propto \\frac{1}{T} (T^2)^{1/3} = \\frac{T^{2/3}}{T} = T^{-1/3}$.\n    *   So, the key physical relationship is $K_s \\propto T^{-1/3}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    *   We can write the relationship for our two systems as a ratio:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   We already found that $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n    *   So, $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n    *   To find our desired ratio, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we first cube both sides to get rid of the cube root:\n        $\\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$.\n    *   Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get the ratio we want:\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    *   I will use a python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods T2/T1 is equal to (5/7)^3.\n# Let's calculate this value.\nratio_T2_T1 = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio_T2_T1)\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the planet orbits the star, it pulls the star in a small counter-orbit. This movement causes the star's light to be slightly blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away. The \"periodic wavelength shift\" mentioned is a direct result of this Doppler effect.\n\n2.  **Relate Observation to Velocity:** The magnitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K_{star}$.\n    *   For planet #1, $K_{star,1} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms.\n    *   For planet #2, $K_{star,2} \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes is: $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude and Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming planet mass $M_p \\ll$ star mass $M_s$), the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K_{star}$) is given by:\n    $K_{star} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet mass.\n    *   $M_s$ is the star mass.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (which we can assume is the same or cancels out in the ratio).\n\n4.  **Simplify for this Problem:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{s,1} = M_{s,2}$) and the planet masses are similar ($M_{p,1} = M_{p,2}$). All other terms ($G$, $2\\pi$, $\\sin(i)$) are constants. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Period Ratio:** We can express this proportionality as a ratio for our two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^3$\n\n    Now, substitute the known ratio of the velocities:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The python code executed the calculation $(5/7)^3$ and returned `0.3644314868804665`.\n\n    Rounding this value gives approximately 0.36. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
