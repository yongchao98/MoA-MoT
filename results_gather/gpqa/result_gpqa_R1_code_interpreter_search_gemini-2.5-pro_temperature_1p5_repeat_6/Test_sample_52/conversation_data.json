    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structural Information from the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, meaning four hydrogen atoms are attached to the ring. This corresponds to a C6H4 fragment.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This group includes a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring (G1-C6H4-G2 where G1 ≠ G2), the protons ortho to G1 are equivalent, and the protons ortho to G2 are equivalent, leading to two distinct signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group fragment, `-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton H(a) is coupled only to H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The combination results in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One methyl group is identified as part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or an ethyl substituent on the ring.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the following building blocks of the molecule:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n*   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**\n*   An ester group that contains a methyl group but no methylene group. The two possibilities are a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3).\n\nLet's assemble these pieces. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Substituent 1:** Propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). Its contribution to the formula is C3H5.\n*   **Substituent 2:** This must be the ester part containing the second methyl group.\n    *   Case A: The ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon, forming a methyl benzoate derivative. The substituent is `-COOCH3`.\n    *   Case B: The ring is attached to the ester oxygen, forming a phenyl acetate derivative. The substituent is `-O-CO-CH3`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's calculate the total formula by summing the atoms from the fragments. Both Case A and Case B lead to the same final formula. Let's use Case A for the calculation:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 6\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 2\n    *   **Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 4\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 3\n    *   **Total H = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygens (O):**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2\n    *   **Total O = 2**\n\nCombining these, the molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe DBE indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **From the derived structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n    *   Vinyl C=C bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Ester C=O bond = 1 DBE\n    *   **Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n*   **From the proposed formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   DBE = C - (H/2) + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6\n\nThe DBE calculated from the structure (6) matches the DBE calculated from the formula C11H12O2 (6), confirming its plausibility.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Other Options**\n\nLet's quickly check the DBE for the other formulas provided:\n*   **A) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 6. While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra C and 2H (a CH2 unit) compared to our derived formula. This contradicts the \"no –CH2 groups\" information from the NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 5. Incorrect DBE.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 7. Incorrect DBE.\n\nTherefore, C11H12O2 is the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
