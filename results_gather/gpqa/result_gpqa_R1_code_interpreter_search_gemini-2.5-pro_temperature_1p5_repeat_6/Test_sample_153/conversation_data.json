    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic version of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. The ratio of the peak heights (M⁺ to M⁺+2) is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** This 3:1 ratio for an M⁺ and M⁺+2 peak is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule (Chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   We can confirm the molecular weight of the options. All proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight corresponding to the MS data.\n    *   C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 g/mol.\n*   The MS data confirms the molecular formula is likely C₇H₅ClO₂ but doesn't differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules, which form dimers.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of the C=O bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of these two peaks is a definitive signature for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to rule out options that do not contain a carboxylic acid, such as **(A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde and a phenol) and **(D) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an acid chloride / ester).\n\n### **3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: **(B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **(C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The NMR spectrum will distinguish between them.\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   We have two signals in the aromatic region: a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   The total integration is 4 protons, which is correct for a chlorobenzoic acid (C₆H₄ + COOH + Cl).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. This symmetry means the two protons next to one substituent are chemically identical, and the two protons next to the other substituent are also chemically identical.\n    *   **In 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, the COOH is at C1 and the Cl is at C4. The protons at C2 and C6 are equivalent, and the protons at C3 and C5 are equivalent. This creates the observed \"two doublets, 2H each\" pattern.\n    *   **In 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, the substituents are adjacent (at C1 and C2). This removes the molecule's symmetry. All four aromatic protons would be in different chemical environments, leading to four separate and more complex signals, not the simple pattern observed.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   The IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, indicates a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) aromatic ring structure.\n\nCombining all the evidence, the only structure that fits all the spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
