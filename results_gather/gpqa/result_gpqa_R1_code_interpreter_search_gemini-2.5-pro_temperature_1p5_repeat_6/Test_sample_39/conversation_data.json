    "*   **Analyze the Context:** The conversation is between two chemists in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. The key phrase is \"my compounds are on top of each other,\" which is stated as the reason for an experiment going \"not well.\" This implies a problem with separating different chemical compounds.\n\n*   **Evaluate Common Separation Techniques:** In synthetic organic chemistry, the primary method for purifying and separating compounds from a reaction mixture is chromatography, most commonly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for analysis and Column Chromatography for preparative separation.\n    *   **How Chromatography Works:** This technique separates molecules based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel, which is polar) and a mobile phase (a solvent, or eluent, of varying polarity). Compounds with different polarities will travel through the stationary phase at different rates.\n    *   **What \"On Top of Each Other\" Means in Chromatography:** When running a TLC, if two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate, and their spots on the TLC plate will be very close together or overlap, appearing \"on top of each other.\" Similarly, in column chromatography, compounds with similar polarities will elute from the column at the same time, making them impossible to separate into different collection flasks. Their bands on the column literally overlap, or are \"on top of each other.\" Therefore, the chemist is saying they cannot separate their desired product from a starting material or a byproduct because they have nearly identical polarities.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While these interactions exist, and are the basis for how chromatography works (interactions with the stationary phase), this statement doesn't describe the *problem* of failed separation. The problem isn't that they are bonding to each other, but that they are interacting with the chromatography medium in the same way.\n    *   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would be a problem if the chemist were trying to separate them by distillation. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more characteristic of chromatographic separation.\n    *   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the direct cause of a failed chromatographic separation. If the polarities are too similar, the compounds cannot be resolved by chromatography. This perfectly matches the colloquialism \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **D) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is used for characterization, not for routine separation. Compounds can be easily separated by chromatography even if they have similar or identical optical rotations. This is not relevant to the problem of physical separation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The most direct and common meaning of the phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" in a synthetic organic chemistry lab context refers to a failed separation by chromatography due to the compounds having very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
