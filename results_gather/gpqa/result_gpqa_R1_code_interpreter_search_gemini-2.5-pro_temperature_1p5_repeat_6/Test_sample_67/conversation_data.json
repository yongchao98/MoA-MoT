    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment `vec(mu)` is related to its spin `vec(S)` by `vec(mu) = gamma * vec(S)`. The constant `gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there's a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction.\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state. The interaction Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -vec(mu) . vec(B) = -mu_z * B = -gamma * S_z * B`.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the z-component of spin `S_z` has two eigenvalues: `+hbar/2` (spin-up, `|+z>`) and `-hbar/2` (spin-down, `|-z>`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -gamma * B * (+hbar/2)` and `E_down = -gamma * B * (-hbar/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `gamma` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|psi(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [[1],[0]]`, this is our starting vector.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change and New Hamiltonian (`t > 0`):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field `B_y` of the same magnitude `B` is turned on in the +Y direction.\n    *   The system's evolution for `t>0` is governed by the new Hamiltonian, `H_new = -vec(mu) . vec(B_y) = -mu_y * B = -gamma * B * S_y`.\n    *   The term `gamma * B` represents a characteristic frequency, known as the Larmor frequency. Let's denote it by `omega = gamma * B`. So, `H_new = -omega * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution (Schrödinger Picture):**\n    *   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|psi(t)> = U(t) |psi(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-i * H_new * t / hbar)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting `H_new` and `S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y` (where `sigma_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix):\n        `U(t) = exp(-i * (-omega * (hbar/2) * sigma_y) * t / hbar) = exp(i * (omega * t / 2) * sigma_y)`.\n    *   We can expand the exponential of the Pauli matrix using the identity `exp(i * A * sigma_k) = cos(A) * I + i * sin(A) * sigma_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n        Here, `A = omega * t / 2` and `sigma_k = sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n        `U(t) = cos(omega*t/2) * I + i * sin(omega*t/2) * sigma_y`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]]`\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|psi(0)> = [[1], [0]]`:\n        `|psi(t)> = [[cos(omega*t/2), sin(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2), cos(omega*t/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(omega*t/2)], [-sin(omega*t/2)]]`\n    *   This can also be written as: `|psi(t)> = cos(omega*t/2) * |+z> - sin(omega*t/2) * |-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<mu_z(t)>`.\n    *   `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * <psi(t) | S_z | psi(t)>`.\n    *   Let's calculate `<psi(t) | S_z | psi(t)>`.\n        The operator `S_z` acts on `|psi(t)>`:\n        `S_z |psi(t)> = S_z * (cos(omega*t/2)|+z> - sin(omega*t/2)|-z>)`\n        `= cos(omega*t/2) * S_z|+z> - sin(omega*t/2) * S_z|-z>`\n        `= cos(omega*t/2) * (hbar/2)|+z> - sin(omega*t/2) * (-hbar/2)|-z>`\n        `= (hbar/2) * [cos(omega*t/2)|+z> + sin(omega*t/2)|-z>]`\n    *   Now, we take the inner product with `<psi(t)| = cos(omega*t/2)<+z| - sin(omega*t/2)<-z|`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * [cos(omega*t/2)<+z| - sin(omega*t/2)<-z|] * [cos(omega*t/2)|+z> + sin(omega*t/2)|-z>]`\n    *   Using the orthonormality of the basis states (`<+z|+z> = 1`, `<+z|-z> = 0`, etc.), we get:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * [cos^2(omega*t/2) - sin^2(omega*t/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric double-angle identity `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)`, this simplifies to:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (hbar/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<mu_z(t)> = gamma * <S_z(t)> = gamma * (hbar/2) * cos(omega*t)`\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation with an amplitude `gamma*hbar/2` and an angular frequency `omega`.\n    *   We defined `omega = gamma * B`.\n    *   The question asks for the oscillation frequency. Given the options, it refers to the angular frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `omega = gamma * B`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, starts to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at the Larmor frequency. Its projection on the Z-axis oscillates as a cosine function with this frequency.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# This script provides a symbolic verification of the derivation.\n\n# Define symbolic variables for clarity\nt = sp.Symbol('t', real=True)          # time\ngamma = sp.Symbol('gamma', real=True, positive=True) # gyromagnetic ratio\nB = sp.Symbol('B', real=True, positive=True)      # magnetic field magnitude\nhbar = sp.Symbol('hbar', real=True, positive=True) # reduced Planck constant\n\n# The Larmor frequency\nomega = gamma * B\n\n# --- Schrödinger Picture Calculation ---\n\n# The Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * S_y = -omega * S_y.\n# The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar) = exp(i * omega * t * S_y / hbar).\n# For a spin-1/2 particle, S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y.\n# U(t) = exp(i * (omega * t / 2) * sigma_y).\n# Using the identity exp(i*A*sigma_k) = cos(A)*I + i*sin(A)*sigma_k:\nA = omega * t / 2\nsigma_y = sp.Matrix([[0, -sp.I], [sp.I, 0]])\nI = sp.eye(2)\nU_t = sp.cos(A) * I + sp.I * sp.sin(A) * sigma_y\n\n# The initial state is spin-up along Z, |psi(0)> = |+z>\npsi_0 = sp.Matrix([[1], [0]])\n\n# The state at time t is |psi(t)> = U(t)|psi(0)>\npsi_t = U_t * psi_0\n\n# The operator for the z-component of spin is S_z = (hbar/2)*sigma_z\nS_z = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n# The expectation value is <S_z(t)> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>\nexpectation_S_z = (psi_t.conjugate().transpose() * S_z * psi_t)[0,0]\n\n# Simplify the expression to find the time dependence\nsimplified_exp_S_z = sp.simplify(expectation_S_z)\n\n# The result is of the form Amplitude * cos(frequency * t).\n# We are interested in the 'frequency' term.\nprint(f\"The expectation value of S_z is: <S_z(t)> = {simplified_exp_S_z}\")\nprint(f\"The oscillation term is cos(omega*t), where omega = gamma*B.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma*B.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
