    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** 8 C atoms. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   Presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   Presence of an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Goal:** Match this information to one of the provided 1H NMR spectra.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for the C2-carbonyl substituent:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This group has exactly 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very plausible option.\n    *   **Phenylacetaldehyde side chain (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   Now let's combine these possibilities with the halogen substituent to form the final molecule.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1: Halo-acetophenone.** The structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This has 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 8 carbons. It has a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. This structure fits all the initial criteria.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2: Halo-phenylacetaldehyde.** The structure is X-C6H4-CH2CHO. This also fits the carbon count and substituent requirements.\n\n**3. Analyze the Expected 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\n\n*   **For Halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3):**\n    *   There are 4 protons on the aromatic ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   There are 3 protons on the methyl group (`-CH3`). Since this methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and has no adjacent protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)** with an integration of **3H**. Its chemical shift should be around **2.2-2.7 ppm**.\n\n*   **For Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO):**\n    *   There are 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   There is 1 proton on the aldehyde group (`-CHO`). This will appear as a signal far downfield, typically **9-10 ppm**. It would likely be a triplet (t) due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.\n    *   There are 2 protons on the methylene group (`-CH2-`). This will appear as a signal around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. It would likely be a doublet (d) due to coupling with the aldehyde proton.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent. It has signals at unusual chemical shifts (4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons). The integration of the upfield singlet is 2H, not 3H, which rules out a methyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), which contradicts the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is characteristic of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield shifts indicate the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, which both the halogen and acetyl group are.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This perfectly matches the expected signal for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent (-COCH**3**).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This spectrum is a perfect match for **para-halo-acetophenone**. This molecule satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` indicates an **aldehyde** group.\n    *   The `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern again suggests a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   The `3.7 (2H, s)` suggests a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   This data would correspond to a structure like 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde (CHO-C6H4-CH2X).\n    *   However, in this structure, the halogen is attached to the methyl carbon, not the aromatic ring. This contradicts the FTIR data which specifies an **aromatic-halogen bond**. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with all the provided information (8 carbons, di-substituted aromatic ring, carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond) is option C. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
