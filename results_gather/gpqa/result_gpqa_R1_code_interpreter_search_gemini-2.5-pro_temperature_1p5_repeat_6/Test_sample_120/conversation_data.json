    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The parent structure, 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, is cyclohexene oxide. The epoxide is formed across two adjacent carbons of a cyclohexane ring, which are numbered C1 and C6 in the bicyclic naming system.\n    *   The molecule has methyl substituents at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. The nucleophile is the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### 2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction\nThe problem provides two key rules for this specific type of reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n*   The epoxide ring is across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We need to determine which carbon, C1 or C6, is less sterically hindered.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group in addition to being part of the bicyclic ring system. It is a quaternary carbon atom (bonded to C2, C6, Oxygen, and a Methyl Carbon).\n*   Carbon C6 is only substituted with a hydrogen atom (and bonded to C1, C5, and Oxygen). It is a tertiary carbon atom.\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon (C1) to a tertiary carbon (C6), **C6 is significantly less sterically hindered.**\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Substitution Pattern of the Product\n*   The attack of the nucleophile at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The C6-O bond breaks, and the C1-O bond remains. After an aqueous workup, the oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The original cyclohexane ring skeleton remains intact.\n*   The starting material has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. Let's call this `new C1`, which corresponds to `old C1`.\n*   We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. If we number counter-clockwise, the substituents are on:\n    *   `new C1` (the original methyl group on `old C1`)\n    *   `new C2` (the new methyl group added to `old C6`)\n    *   `new C4` (the original methyl group on `old C4`)\n    *   `new C5` (the original methyl group on `old C3`)\n    *   The substitution pattern is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options A and C, which have a `2,2,4,5` substitution pattern. A `2,2` pattern (gem-dimethyl) would only arise if the nucleophilic attack occurred at C1.\n\n### 5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product (Stereoselectivity)\n*   The second rule states that there is an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked.\n*   The nucleophile attacks C6.\n*   The starting material's configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   Inversion of an S configuration results in an R configuration.\n*   In the product, `old C6` has become `new C2`.\n*   Therefore, the stereocenter at `new C2` in the product must have an **R configuration**.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Remaining Options\n*   We are left with two possible answers:\n    *   B) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   Our analysis concluded that the configuration at C2 must be **R**.\n*   Only option D has a (2R) configuration.\n\nThe configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C4, C5) are determined by the starting material, but the key to solving the problem is applying the explicit rule of inversion at the site of attack. The (6S) center becomes a (2R) center.\n\n<<<D>>>"
