    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze Planet (a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This planet is, by definition, identical to Earth.\n    *   Earth's average density is a standard value, approximately 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). We will use this as our baseline for comparison.\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Planet (b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    *   The problem explicitly states the density of this planet.\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   This density is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze Planet (c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   \"Same composition\" means it's made of the same materials (like iron, silicon, oxygen, etc.) in the same proportions as Earth.\n    *   However, mass is a critical factor for density. Gravity is proportional to mass. A planet with 5 times the mass of Earth will have much stronger internal gravity.\n    *   This intense gravity will compress the materials inside the planet much more than in Earth. The atoms are squeezed closer together.\n    *   This effect is known as **gravitational compression**.\n    *   Because the material is more compressed, it occupies a smaller volume for its mass compared to a less massive planet.\n    *   Density is calculated as Mass / Volume. Since the mass is significantly higher and the material is more compressed (leading to a proportionally smaller volume increase), the overall density will be greater than Earth's.\n    *   Therefore, Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Analyze Planet (d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   This is the opposite scenario to planet (c).\n    *   It has the same composition as Earth but less mass.\n    *   With only half the mass, its internal gravity is weaker.\n    *   The gravitational compression will be less than that experienced by Earth.\n    *   Its constituent materials will be less compressed, or \"fluffier,\" than Earth's.\n    *   Therefore, its overall density will be lower than Earth's.\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n5.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nBased on this comparison, the planet with the highest density is planet (c).\n\n<<<C>>>"
