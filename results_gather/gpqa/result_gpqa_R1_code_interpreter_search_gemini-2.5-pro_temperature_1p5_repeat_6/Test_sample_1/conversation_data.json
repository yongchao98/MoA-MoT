    "*   **Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   trans-cinnamaldehyde: Its structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. Let's count the carbons: 6 in the phenyl ring (C₆H₅), and 3 in the propenal side chain (-CH=CH-CHO). Total = 6 + 3 = 9 carbon atoms.\n        *   Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr): This is a Grignard reagent. It acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents perform a 1,2-nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon of aldehydes. The methyl group attacks the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon. Following an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure for Grignard reactions), the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 1:** The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol with a methyl group attached (-CH(OH)CH₃). The structure of Product 1 is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃, which is (E)-1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** We started with 9 carbons in cinnamaldehyde and added 1 carbon from the methyl group. So, Product 1 has 9 + 1 = 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 1 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃), which is a secondary alcohol.\n    *   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent. It oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones without affecting other functional groups like carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH₃) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   **Product 2:** The structure of Product 2 is C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃, which is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (also known as benzalacetone).\n    *   **Carbon Count:** Oxidation does not add or remove carbon atoms. Thus, Product 2 has the same number of carbons as Product 1, which is 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 2 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃), which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the systematic name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, ((CH₃)₂S(=O)CH₂), also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This reagent is a sulfur ylide used to add a methylene group (CH₂).\n    *   **Reaction:** With α,β-unsaturated ketones, the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent undergoes a conjugate addition (Michael addition) reaction. The CH₂ group from the ylide adds across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   **Product 3:** The C=C double bond in Product 2 becomes a cyclopropane ring. The final product is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethanone.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The reaction adds one carbon atom (from the CH₂ of the ylide) to the structure of Product 2. So, Product 3 has 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\n**Summary of Carbon Count:**\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 C\n*   Product 1 (after adding CH₃): 9 + 1 = 10 C\n*   Product 2 (after oxidation): 10 C\n*   Product 3 (after adding CH₂): 10 + 1 = 11 C\n\nTherefore, the final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
