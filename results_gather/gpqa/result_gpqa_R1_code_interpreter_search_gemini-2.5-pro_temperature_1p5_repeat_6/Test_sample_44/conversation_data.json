    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Particle Properties:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n    *   Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions.\n    *   A key property of identical fermions is that they obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   The quantum state of a particle in this potential well is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and its spin projection quantum number (*m_s*). For a spin-1/2 particle, *m_s* can be +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down).\n    *   Therefore, for any given energy level *n*, there are two distinct quantum states (n, spin up) and (n, spin down). This means a maximum of two fermions can be placed in any single energy level *n*.\n\n2.  **Define Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   The energy of a single particle in such a well is given by the formula:\n        E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²).\n    *   So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n        E_n = n² * E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    *   Let's list the first few single-particle energy levels:\n        *   n = 1: E₁ = 1²E = E\n        *   n = 2: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n        *   n = 3: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n        *   n = 4: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs):**\n    *   The ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy for the system.\n    *   To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle (max two particles per level).\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** We can place two fermions here.\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We can place the remaining two fermions here.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n    *   E_gs = (2 particles × E₁) + (2 particles × E₂)\n    *   E_gs = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy *above* the ground state.\n    *   We achieve this by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. To make the energy increase as small as possible, we should promote a particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO).\n    *   In the ground state, the HOMO is n=2 and the LUMO is n=3.\n    *   So, we move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   The new configuration is:\n        *   **Level n=1:** two particles\n        *   **Level n=2:** one particle\n        *   **Level n=3:** one particle\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    *   E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n    *   E_1st = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E (Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2)\n    *   **Excitation Option 1 (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n        *   Total Energy = (2×E) + (1×4E) + (1×9E) = 15E. (This is the first excited state).\n    *   **Excitation Option 2:** Promote one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest available level, n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n        *   Total Energy = (1×E) + (2×4E) + (1×9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Excitation Option 3:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n        *   Total Energy = (2×E) + (2×9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   **Excitation Option 4:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 0 in n=3, 1 in n=4.\n        *   Total Energy = (2×E) + (1×4E) + (1×16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\n    *   Comparing the energies of the excited states: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...\n    *   The lowest is 15E (the first excited state).\n    *   The next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\n    This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
