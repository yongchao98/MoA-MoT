    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as follows:\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n        DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (which accounts for 1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   The two medium to strong bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch (approx. 1750-1735 cm-1), especially a conjugated one.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: This signal is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This signal is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The coupling of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the quartet suggests the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift, combined with the IR data, confirm the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts mean the two substituents are different electronically. One is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the nearby protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm). The other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields the nearby protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have an ethyl group part of an ester: **-COOCH2CH3**. This is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n    2.  We have a primary amine group: **-NH2**. This is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    3.  We have a benzene ring that is **para-substituted** with the EDG and the EWG.\n    4.  Placing the -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3 groups at positions 1 and 4 on a benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure. The protons ortho to the -NH2 group would be shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -COOCH2CH3 group would be deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data derived from our analysis.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has an amide C=O (wrong IR freq), a meta-substitution pattern (wrong NMR splitting), and an ethoxy group instead of an ethyl ester.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H band in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This ester (4-H2N-C6H4-O-C(=O)CH2CH3) would show a quartet for the -CH2- protons around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
