    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    Let's draw the structure. It's a 6-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at C5. The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n    ```\n          O\n          ||\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3\n    1   2  3  4   5        6\n    ```\n    The molecule has one chiral center at C5, with the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is prochiral (a planar sp2 carbon). The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Attack from one face gives the (3R) alcohol.\n    *   Attack from the other face gives the (3S) alcohol.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Since the C5 configuration remains (S), two products are formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two chiral centers. They have the same configuration at one center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Note that because the starting material is chiral, these two diastereomers will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    ```\n          O       O\n          ||      ||\n    CH3 - C - CH2 - C - CH3\n    1   2   3   4   5\n    ```\n    This molecule is achiral and has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n    NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, creating two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The two new chiral centers at C2 and C4 can have either (R) or (S) configurations. The possible combinations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's check for internal symmetry. The molecule is symmetrical around the central CH2 group. If we consider the (2R, 4S) structure, it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) structure is identical to the (2R, 4S) structure (it can be superimposed by rotation).\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Chiral)\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Chiral, enantiomer of the above)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Achiral)\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined into a single sample. This sample contains a total of **five** distinct chemical compounds (two diastereomers from Reaction I, and one pair of enantiomers + one meso compound from Reaction II).\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It is an **achiral** technique.\n*   Achiral techniques **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and will therefore have the same retention time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Achiral techniques **can** separate diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will have different retention times.\n*   Let's identify the separable species in the mixture:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol:** A distinct compound.\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol:** The diastereomer of compound 1. It will be separated.\n    3.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** A distinct achiral compound.\n    4.  **The racemic mixture of (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These are enantiomers and will elute together as a single peak. This enantiomeric pair and the meso-diol are diastereomers of each other, so they will be separated.\n*   Furthermore, the products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different polarities. Thus, all four of these groups should be separable.\n*   Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can distinguish between stereoisomers that have different 3D shapes.\n*   It **can** separate enantiomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers.\n*   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical. Our mixture contains five non-identical stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   All five of these compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
