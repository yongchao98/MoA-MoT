    "The user wants me to solve a quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n1.  **Analyze the potential:** The potential is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kr^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian coordinates:** The Schrödinger equation is often easier to solve in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ if the potential separates. The conversion rules are:\n    $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Let's substitute these into the potential expression:\n    The first term is $\\frac{1}{2} kr^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2)$.\n    The second term involves $r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) = (r \\cos(\\theta))^2 = x^2$. So, the second term is $\\frac{3}{2} k x^2$.\n\n    Now, combine the terms to get the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kx^2$\n    $V(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k\\right) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{4}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n3.  **Separate the Schrödinger equation:** The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where:\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n    $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n    This represents two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The total energy $E$ of the system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators: $E = E_x + E_y$.\n\n4.  **Find the energy for the x-oscillator:**\n    The potential for a standard 1D harmonic oscillator is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} m\\omega^2 x^2$. Its energy eigenvalues are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    For the x-direction, we have $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$. Comparing this to the standard form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} m\\omega_x^2 = 2k$\n    $\\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m}$\n    $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) = (2n_x + 1)\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n5.  **Find the energy for the y-oscillator:**\n    For the y-direction, we have $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$. Comparing this to the standard form $V(y) = \\frac{1}{2} m\\omega_y^2 y^2$:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} m\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k$\n    $\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$\n    $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n6.  **Find the total energy spectrum:**\n    The total energy is the sum $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$:\n    $E = (2n_x + 1)\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n    The quantum numbers $n_x$ and $n_y$ can be any non-negative integer ($0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)\\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    Let's check the options provided:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Our result matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
