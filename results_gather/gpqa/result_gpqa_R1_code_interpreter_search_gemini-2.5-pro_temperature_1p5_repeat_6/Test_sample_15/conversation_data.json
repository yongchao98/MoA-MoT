    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) is a common indicator of chirality, but the molecule as a whole must be asymmetric (i.e., it must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is CH(Cl)=C(CH3)CH2CH3.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   There are no stereocenters.\n    *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This name describes a complex bicyclic molecule. The key information is in the stereodescriptors: (3aR, 7aS).\n    *   These descriptors indicate the absolute configuration at two specific stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a.\n    *   Naming a compound as a specific R/S isomer means we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition optically active.\n    *   While some molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds, like the (2R,3S) isomer below), this typically requires a high degree of symmetry. The parent structure (endo-norbornane anhydride) is meso, but the presence of the unsymmetrical `=C(E)HCl` substituent at the bridge carbon (C8) destroys the plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral, and since a specific enantiomer is given, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3: -H, -CH3, and -COOH.\n    *   In the (2R,3S) isomer, the two stereocenters have opposite configurations.\n    *   Drawing the molecule (e.g., using a Fischer projection) reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but also a plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Thus, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R).\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   This molecule is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the alkene side of the ring (-CH=CH-), and the alkane side of the ring (-CH2-CH2-). The two paths around the ring from C1 are different.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all-cis isomer).\n    *   The molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (Ïƒv). Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbon atom CH(CH3)2 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. No other carbon atom is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters. Due to free rotation around the single bonds, it can easily adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (Active)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (Active)\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (Active)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
