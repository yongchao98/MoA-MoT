    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the aldehyde proton in the NMR.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (1H is split by 2H, so 2+1=3 peaks, a triplet). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield shifts (compared to benzene at 7.26 ppm) suggest the ring is attached to an electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2H in this region is typical for the protons of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadening is due to fast proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. Its doublet (d) splitting confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks, a doublet). Its chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group positioned between an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Assemble the fragments:**\n    We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group. Assembling these gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: The structure C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) has a formula of C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given molecular formula.\n\nThe starting compound is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard set of reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n    Structure: [N2]+Cl- — C6H4 — CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to an aqueous solution of an aromatic diazonium salt and gently warming it causes the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium group, replacing it with a hydroxyl (-OH) group and evolving nitrogen gas (N2).\n    The product is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    Structure: HO — C6H4 — CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This is a strong base (KOH) with heat, applied to an aldehyde that possesses α-hydrogens (the -CH2- group is alpha to the -CHO group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction. The reaction is a self-condensation since only one type of aldehyde is present.\n\n    **Mechanism of Aldol Condensation:**\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- ⇌ [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde.\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option B).\n        Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO\n    4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The base removes the acidic α-hydrogen (at C2), and the -OH group is eliminated from the β-position (C3). This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO --(Heat, -H2O)--> HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The formation of the conjugated system (C=C double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group and an aromatic ring) is thermodynamically favored, especially with heating.\n\n*   Let's compare this structure to the given options:\n    *   **A) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This matches our derived final product.\n    *   **B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n    *   **C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n    *   **D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This is incorrect as it only has one hydroxyphenyl substituent and the double bond position is wrong for this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
