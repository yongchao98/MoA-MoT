    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n1.  **Understand the Reaction and the Question:**\n    The reaction is electrophilic bromination of substituted benzene rings. The question asks to arrange the given substances in order of *increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer*. The weight fraction of an isomer is directly proportional to its mole fraction (or percentage yield), because all monobromo-isomers of a given starting material have the same molar mass. Therefore, we need to arrange the substances based on the increasing percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:**\n    The position of electrophilic substitution on a benzene ring is determined by the nature of the substituent already present. We classify them as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n    *   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n        *   -CH3 (in Toluene, 1): Activating group.\n        *   -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating group.\n        *   -Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating group, but ortho-, para-directing.\n\n    *   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of ortho and para isomers is very low.\n        *   -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating group.\n        *   -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating group.\n        *   -COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating group.\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directing Groups:**\n    Substances with meta-directing groups will produce the lowest amount of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product will be extremely small. We need to order them.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It withdraws electron density very effectively, making ortho and para positions highly electron-deficient. This results in the lowest yield of the para-isomer. So, **Nitrobenzene (4)** will be first in the list (lowest para yield).\n    *   Comparing -COOH (6) and -COOC2H5 (2), both are deactivating. Generally, the order of deactivating strength is -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOR. Experimental data shows that bromination of benzoic acid yields about 1-2% para-isomer, while ethyl benzoate yields slightly more, about 4-5%. This is because the ester group is slightly less deactivating.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for these three is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:**\n    Substances with ortho-, para-directing groups will have a significant, often majority, yield of the para-isomer. We need to order them based on the para-to-ortho ratio.\n\n    *   **Alkyl groups (-CH3 and -C2H5):** For activating alkyl groups, the ratio of para to ortho product is largely determined by steric hindrance. The incoming electrophile (bromine) is bulky and will preferentially attack the less sterically hindered para position. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher proportion of the para product than toluene to avoid steric clash at the ortho positions.\n        *   So, the para yield from **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n        *   (Note: While some experimental data shows a slight anomaly for ethylbenzene, the general principle taught and tested is that steric hindrance increases the para/ortho ratio. Following this principle is key.)\n\n    *   **Halogen group (-Cl):** Halogens are a special case. They are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive electron-withdrawal (-I effect), but direct ortho/para due to their resonance electron-donation (+R effect). The inductive effect is distance-dependent and strongly deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This leads to a very high preference for the para product. Bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 88% para-isomer, which is higher than for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n        *   Thus, **Chlorobenzene (3)** will have the highest yield of the para-isomer in this group.\n\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for these three is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders:**\n    Now we combine the two ordered subgroups. The meta-directors have the lowest para yields, and the ortho-, para-directors have the highest.\n\n    *   Low para yield group: `4 < 6 < 2`\n    *   High para yield group: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\n    Combining them gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    Let's compare our derived order with the given choices:\n    A) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n    B) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n    C) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n    D) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\n    Our derived order `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
