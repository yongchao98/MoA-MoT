    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` (for L) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity of the initial state:** The parity of an NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin of the initial state:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This leads to the rule that the sum of isospin (T), spin (S), and orbital angular momentum (L) must be an odd integer: `L + S + T = odd`.\n    *   For the initial state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i = odd`, which means the initial isospin must be `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Rules for the Decay\n\nThe decay process is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`. We are given several rules to check if a decay is permitted.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter: `s` (`l_X=0`), `p` (`l_X=1`), `d` (`l_X=2`), `f` (`l_X=3`).\n    *   The spin of particle X (`s_X`) is not given. We will assume it's a spin-0 particle, which is common in such problems (e.g., a pion). This is a reasonable assumption that simplifies the angular momentum conservation.\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states the final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem explicitly states: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Rearranging this gives `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 (mod 2)`, which means the sum `T_f + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    *   Since we are given `T_f = 0`, this simplifies to the condition that **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   This implies that **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    *   Total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n    *   Assuming particle X has spin `s_X = 0`, its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is `\\vec{J}_{f,tot} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{l_X}`.\n    *   For this to equal zero, the vectors `\\vec{J_f}` and `\\vec{l_X}` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). -> **FAIL**. The sum must be odd.\n*   Since this decay violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state (which is given as a mandatory condition), this partial wave is not permitted. We can stop here, but let's check the other rules for completeness.\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is forbidden due to the violation of the Pauli principle.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   This option describes a final NN state `7D1`. The `7` means `2S+1=7`, which implies `S_f=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. Therefore, this state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   However, if we mechanically apply the rules given in the problem:\n    *   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n    *   Particle X state `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n    1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). -> **OK**\n    2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). -> **OK**\n    3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay passes all the checks given in the problem. The issue is with the physical existence of the state, not the process itself according to the given rules. Option B is the only one that fails a rule explicitly provided for checking the process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe partial wave described in option B, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`, is not permitted because the final two-nucleon state `3P0` with isospin `T=0` violates the generalized Pauli exclusion principle (`S_f + L_f` is even, not odd). This directly contradicts one of the conditions specified in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
