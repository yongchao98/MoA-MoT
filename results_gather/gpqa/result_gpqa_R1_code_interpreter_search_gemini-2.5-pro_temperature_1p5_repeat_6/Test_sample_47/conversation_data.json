    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n\nThis is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to replace one of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) with a bromine atom. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-carbons are equivalent.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\n\nThis step is crucial. 2-Bromocyclohexanone is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it can undergo two possible reactions:\n1.  **Elimination (E2):** The hydroxide ion could act as a base, removing a proton from C3, leading to the elimination of HBr and forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-enone.\n2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** The hydroxide ion can remove a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), which is more acidic. The resulting enolate then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide to form a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl group of this intermediate, leading to ring-opening and rearrangement. The product is the salt of a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring.\n\nTo decide which pathway is correct, we must look at the subsequent reaction steps. The sequence of reactions makes much more sense if the Favorskii rearrangement occurs.\n\n*   **Favorskii Rearrangement:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate. After an acidic workup (which is implied before the next step), the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   The -OH group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and bulky reducing agent. Its classic use in organic synthesis is the selective reduction of an acid chloride to an aldehyde, without over-reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n\n*   The acid chloride group (-COCl) is reduced to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique proton environments in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon to which it is attached, and the C1-H bond, bisecting the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's label the protons:\n*   **Aldehyde proton (H_ald):** This proton is unique. There is only one of its kind. (1 type)\n*   **C1 proton (H1):** This is the proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It is a unique methine proton. (1 type)\n*   **C2 and C5 protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself (one 'cis' and one 'trans' to the aldehyde group, considering the ring's puckering) are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals in an NMR spectrum. (2 types)\n*   **C3 and C4 protons:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4 by symmetry. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. These four protons also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n1.  H_aldehyde\n2.  H1\n3.  H2/H5 (set A)\n4.  H2/H5 (set B)\n5.  H3/H4 (set C)\n6.  H3/H4 (set D)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
