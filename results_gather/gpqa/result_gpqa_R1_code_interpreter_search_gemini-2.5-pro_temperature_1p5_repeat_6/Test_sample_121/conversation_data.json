    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. While the conditions are not the classic Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction (which uses PBr3), the outcome is the same: bromination at the alpha-position. Pyridine acts as a base to catalyze the reaction and neutralize the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** α-bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reagents:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Reagents:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  Ethyl cyanoacetate is an \"active methylene compound\". The two protons on the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and the ester (-COOCH2CH3) group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) and can be removed by a strong base like NaH.\n    2.  The first equivalent of NaH deprotonates the ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    3.  This carbanion is a strong nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    4.  The intermediate product still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. The \"excess sodium hydride\" removes this second acidic proton, creating another carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H₂`\n    5.  This newly formed carbanion undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain. This closes the ring. The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the 5 carbons of the pentyl chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this final product.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry has important consequences for the NMR spectrum.\n    *   The two halves of the ring are mirror images. Therefore, the protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the protons on C6. Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n    *   C1 has no protons. C4 is unique and lies on the symmetry plane.\n*   **Counting the distinct proton signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂-) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    2.  **Cyclohexane ring:** Due to the fixed conformation (ring flipping is restricted by the bulky groups on C1) and the presence of substituents, geminal protons (protons on the same carbon) are not equivalent. Specifically, axial and equatorial protons are chemically distinct (diastereotopic).\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent by symmetry. However, at each position, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments. Thus, there are two distinct proton signals for these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent by symmetry. Again, the axial and equatorial protons at each position are distinct. This gives another two signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **C4:** This position is unique. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up all the distinct signals: 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
