    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts:\na) The relative speed (v_rel) between them.\nb) The total energy (E) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n*   Astronaut 1: Rest mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c`.\n*   Astronaut 2: Rest mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c`.\n*   Both velocities are in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation:**\n\n*   **For Relative Speed (v_rel):** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, not simple subtraction. The formula for two objects moving in the same direction is:\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n*   **For Total Energy (E):** The total energy of a system is the sum of the individual total energies of its components. The total energy of a single relativistic object is given by `E = γ * m_rest * c^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   First, calculate the energy of astronaut 1 (E1).\n    *   Second, calculate the energy of astronaut 2 (E2).\n    *   Finally, add them together: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I will use a Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Velocities in terms of c\nv1_c = 0.6\nv2_c = 0.5\n# Masses in terms of m\nm1_m = 2.0\nm2_m = 3.0\n\n# --- Part 1: Calculate Relative Speed (v_rel) ---\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2)  (in units of c)\nnumerator_v = v1_c - v2_c\ndenominator_v = 1 - (v1_c * v2_c)\nv_rel_c = numerator_v / denominator_v\n\n# --- Part 2: Calculate Total Energy (E_total) ---\n# E = gamma * m_rest * c^2\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)\n\n# Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)\nenergy1_mc2 = gamma1 * m1_m  # Energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)\nenergy2_mc2 = gamma2 * m2_m  # Energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Total Energy\ntotal_energy_mc2 = energy1_mc2 + energy2_mc2\n\n# --- Print the results ---\nprint(f\"Relative speed (v_rel): {v_rel_c:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy (E): {total_energy_mc2:.2f}mc^2\")\n\n```\n<execute_code>\nv_rel_c = (0.6 - 0.5) / (1 - 0.6 * 0.5) = 0.1 / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1 / 0.7 = 0.142857...\ngamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\nenergy1 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2\ngamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547...\nenergy2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c^2 = 3.4641 mc^2\ntotal_energy = energy1 + energy2 = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2\n</execute_code>\n**5. Analyze the Results:**\n\nThe calculation gives:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\n**6.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\nThis problem involves special relativity. We need two key formulas:\n*   **Relativistic Velocity Addition/Subtraction:** When dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't simply add or subtract velocities. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v1` and `v2` (as measured in a stationary frame), the relative velocity `v_rel` of object 1 with respect to object 2 is given by the formula:\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n*   **Total Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a moving object is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. It is given by the formula:\n    `E = γ * m_rest * c^2`\n    where `m_rest` is the rest mass and `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n\nThe total energy of a system of particles is the sum of the total energies of each individual particle.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Astronaut 1: Rest mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c`.\n*   Astronaut 2: Rest mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c`.\n*   Both velocities are in the same direction.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\nWe use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c`.\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\nThe total energy of the system is `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n\n**a. Calculate Energy of Astronaut 1 (E1):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ1` for astronaut 1.\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v1/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c/c)^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate `E1`.\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**b. Calculate Energy of Astronaut 2 (E2):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ2` for astronaut 2.\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c/c)^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate `E2`.\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n**c. Calculate Total Energy (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n*   `E_total = 5.9641 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
