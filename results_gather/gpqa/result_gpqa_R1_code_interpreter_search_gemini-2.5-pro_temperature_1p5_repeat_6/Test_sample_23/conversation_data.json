    "This is a chemistry problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the properties of the mixtures and substances involved.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon and is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\").\n*   Its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28% (or 0.1428).\n*   Let's determine the general formula of Z.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H using integer masses (C=12, H=1) is (2n+2)/(14n+2). Setting this to 0.1428 does not yield a positive integer 'n'.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is (2n)/(14n) = 2/14 = 1/7 â‰ˆ 0.142857. This is a very close match to the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The fact that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z means all components in these mixtures have the same carbon skeleton, which is a C_n ring.\n*   Z is a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n**2. Analyze Mixture Y**\n\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water.\n*   One component of Y is Z (the CnH2n cycloalkane). Let's call this Y1.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also have the C_n skeleton (since its hydrogenation gives Z) and must not decolorize bromine water. The most plausible candidate for Y2 is an aromatic hydrocarbon, which is relatively unreactive with bromine water.\n*   The aromatic analog of a CnH2n cycloalkane belongs to the benzene series, with the general formula CnH2n-6.\n*   So, Mixture Y consists of **Y1 = CnH2n (a cycloalkane)** and **Y2 = CnH2n-6 (an aromatic hydrocarbon)**. For this to work, Y1 and Y2 must have the same number of carbon atoms, 'n'.\n\n**3. Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They both decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated.\n*   X has \"no conjugated multiple bonds\".\n*   The reaction is an equimolar mixture X being converted to an equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a Platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`\n*   Since Y1 (CnH2n) is more hydrogenated and Y2 (CnH2n-6) is less hydrogenated than the starting materials X1 and X2, one component of X must have lost hydrogen (was oxidized) and the other must have gained hydrogen (was reduced).\n*   Let's check the conservation of atoms for a 1:1 reaction. The total number of hydrogens must be conserved. Let X1 be CnH_x and X2 be CnH_y.\n    *   `x + y = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`\n*   X1 and X2 are unsaturated versions of the cycloalkane Z. A cycloalkene would have formula CnH(2n-2), and a non-conjugated cyclodiene would be CnH(2n-4).\n*   Let's test these as components of X:\n    *   X1 = CnH(2n-2) (cycloalkene)\n    *   X2 = CnH(2n-4) (cyclodiene)\n*   Let's check our hydrogen conservation rule:\n    *   `x + y = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This matches perfectly.\n*   Therefore, mixture X is composed of a cycloalkene and a non-conjugated cyclodiene with the same carbon skeleton.\n\n**4. Determine the value of 'n' (the number of Carbon atoms)**\n\nThe problem can be solved for any 'n' that results in one of the given answers. Let's test the most common simple cases.\n\n*   **Case n=6:**\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent.\n    *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}. The 1,4-diene is chosen because it is not conjugated.\n    *   The reaction is `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Total H = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\n*   **Case n=7:**\n    *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a solvent.\n    *   Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), Toluene (C7H8)}.\n    *   X = {Methylcyclohexene (C7H12), a non-conjugated Methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)}.\n    *   The reaction is `C7H12 + C7H10 -> C7H14 + C7H8`. This is also a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.\n    *   Total H = (H in C7H12) + (H in C7H10) = 12 + 10 = **22**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBoth n=6 and n=7 lead to plausible scenarios and correspond to options D (18) and A (22). However, problems of this nature in chemistry competitions or textbooks typically refer to the simplest, most fundamental parent system unless specified otherwise. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the archetypal example for this type of transformation (hydrogenation, disproportionation, aromaticity). Therefore, the C6 system is the most probable intended answer.\n\nThe liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
