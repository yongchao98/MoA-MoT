    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (-C≡CH). The formula is C₆H₁₁-C≡CH. The terminal proton on the alkyne is acidic.\n\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's decode this IUPAC name.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (-CHO) group attached. Let's denote this as C₆H₁₁-CHO.\n    *   The carbon on the cyclohexane ring attached to the -CHO group is designated as C1.\n    *   A substituent `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` is attached to this C1 carbon. This substituent's structure is -CH(OH)-C₆H₁₁.\n    *   So, at C1 of a cyclohexane ring, we have both a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)-C₆H₁₁ group. This structure is the product of a self-aldol addition reaction of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n        *   **Molecule 1 (as enolate):** A base removes the acidic α-proton from the C1 of one cyclohexanecarbaldehyde molecule.\n        *   **Molecule 2 (as electrophile):** The resulting enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second cyclohexanecarbaldehyde molecule.\n        *   **Product:** After protonation (workup), the final aldol adduct is formed, which is the target molecule.\n\n### 2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy\n\nThe problem now breaks down into two main parts:\n1.  Synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO) from ethynylcyclohexane (C₆H₁₁-C≡CH).\n2.  Perform a self-aldol addition on the synthesized cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to get the final product.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)\n\nAll options start with `NaNH₂`. When reacted with ethynylcyclohexane, this strong base will deprotonate the terminal alkyne to form a sodium cyclohexylacetylide anion (C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻Na⁺). This is a strong nucleophile and the subsequent step in each option involves reacting it with an electrophile.\n\n**Option A: 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Step 1:** `NaNH₂, methanol`. Methanol is a protic acid. If added after the formation of the acetylide anion, it will simply protonate the anion, regenerating the starting material (ethynylcyclohexane). This step is unproductive. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Step 1:** `NaNH₂, ethyl chloride`. This forms 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Step 2:** `Li/liq. NH₃`. This is a dissolving metal reduction, which reduces the internal alkyne to a *trans*-alkene: `C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Step 3:** `O₃/ H₂O`. This is **oxidative** ozonolysis. It cleaves the double bond and oxidizes the fragments to carboxylic acids. The products would be cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₁-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH₃CH₂-COOH).\n*   The final product is an aldol adduct, not a carboxylic acid. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O** (The numbering seems off, let's analyze the reagents)\n*   **Step 1:** `NaNH₂, methyl chloride`. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃).\n*   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd`. This is catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon. This is a powerful reducing condition that will reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane: propylcyclohexane (C₆H₁₁-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The subsequent ozonolysis step (which is missing but implied by the other options' logic) cannot happen as there is no double or triple bond left. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n*   **Step 1:** `NaNH₂, methyl chloride`. The acetylide anion (C₆H₁₁-C≡C⁻) is alkylated with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) to form 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃). This is a standard S_N2 reaction.\n*   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`. This is Lindlar's catalyst (or a variation of it). It is used for the stereoselective partial reduction of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. The product is (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃).\n*   **Step 3:** `O₃/ (CH₃)₂S`. This is **reductive** ozonolysis. It cleaves the C=C double bond and yields two aldehyde molecules. The products are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO). This step successfully produces the required precursor for the aldol reaction.\n*   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)₂`. Barium hydroxide is a strong base commonly used to catalyze aldol reactions. When added to the mixture of aldehydes, it will promote condensation. Although four different aldol products are possible (two self-condensations and two cross-condensations), the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde will produce the desired product, `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we can conclude that only Option B presents a chemically sound and complete synthetic route from the starting material to the final product. The other options contain incorrect or unproductive steps. While the final step in Option B would lead to a mixture of products, it is the only sequence provided that is capable of synthesizing the target molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>"
