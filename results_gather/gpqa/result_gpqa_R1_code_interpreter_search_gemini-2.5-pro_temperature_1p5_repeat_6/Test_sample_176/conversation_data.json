    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to that of Star_2 ($L_2$), i.e., $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Luminosity:** For a star radiating as a perfect black body, its luminosity (total energy radiated per second) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$\n    where $A$ is the surface area ($4 \\pi R^2$ for a sphere), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the surface temperature.\n    So, $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants ($4\\pi\\sigma$) cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1^2 / R_2^2) \\cdot (T_1^4 / T_2^4) = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Radius ratio: $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$, so $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$.\n    *   Mass ratio: $M_1 = 1.5 \\cdot M_2$. This information is not directly used in the Stefan-Boltzmann law and is likely extraneous.\n    *   Peak Wavelength: The stars *appear* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the observed peak wavelength, $\\lambda_{max, obs}$. So, $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n    *   Radial Velocities: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. This is crucial because a non-zero radial velocity causes a Doppler shift, meaning the observed wavelength is different from the emitted wavelength.\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Wavelength (Wien's Law):** Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's surface temperature to its *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, emit}$):\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{max, emit}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    This means $T \\propto 1 / \\lambda_{max, emit}$. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} / \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Shift:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$) by the Doppler effect. For radial velocity $v_r$ (positive for receding), the non-relativistic approximation (valid for $v \\ll c$) is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    \n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so it is redshifted. $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n7.  **Determine the True Temperature Ratio:** We know from the problem that $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$. Using the relationships from step 6:\n    $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    Now, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 5:\n    $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} / [\\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)]$\n    $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    This shows that because Star 2's light is redshifted to match Star 1's color, Star 2 must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the known ratios for radius and temperature back into the formula from step 3:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)^4$\n\n9.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** We need to plug in the values for $v_{r2}$ and $c$.\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$ (speed of light)\n    Let's use Python to calculate the result accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nv2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\n\n# Physical constants\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# The ratio of temperatures is derived from Doppler-shifted Wien's law:\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\nT1_over_T2_4 = (1 / (1 + v2/c))**4\n\n# The ratio of luminosities is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2**2) * T1_over_T2_4\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.2291\n>>>The calculation shows that the luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2$ is approximately 2.2291. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, yielding a result of approximately 2.2291.\n\nHere's a summary of the reasoning:\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities is given by $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature is determined by Wien's law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{max, emitted}}$). The *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. However, Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its emitted light is Doppler-shifted (redshifted) to a longer wavelength before we observe it.\n    *   For Star_1 (at rest), $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}}$.\n    *   For Star_2 (receding), $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} \\cdot (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs, 2}}$, we have $\\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} \\cdot (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   This means the temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 2}} / \\lambda_{\\text{emitted, 1}} = 1 / (1 + v_2/c)$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Plugging everything in:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_2/c)]^4 = 2.25 / (1 + 700000 / 299792458)^4$.\n\nThe python code calculated this value to be ~2.2291. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value of 2.2291 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
