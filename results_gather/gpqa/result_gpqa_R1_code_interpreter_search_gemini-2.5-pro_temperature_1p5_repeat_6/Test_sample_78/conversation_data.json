    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The provided NMR data is for this product.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   From the ¹H NMR, the number of protons is 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12.\n    *   From the ¹³C NMR, the number of carbons is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11.\n    *   The starting material, Compound X, is C₁₁H₁₂O. The reaction conditions (DABCO, heat) suggest an isomerization reaction, where the molecular formula does not change. Thus, the product's formula is also **C₁₁H₁₂O**.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n\n*   **Functional Group and Structural Analysis from NMR:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a **ketone**. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   The two singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)** indicate two methyl groups (-CH₃) that are not adjacent to any protons. This means they are attached to quaternary carbons, an aromatic ring, or a carbonyl group.\n        *   The two doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H)** and **δ 7.71 (2H)** strongly suggest a **para-substituted benzene ring**. A benzene ring accounts for four degrees of unsaturation.\n        *   The two doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H)** and **δ 7.68 (1H)** indicate a **disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-)**. The protons are coupled to each other. This accounts for the final degree of unsaturation (Total DoU = 1 (ketone) + 4 (ring) + 1 (alkene) = 6).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Let's combine these fragments: a ketone, two methyl groups, a para-substituted ring, and a -CH=CH- group.\n    *   A para-substituted ring requires two substituents. One of them must be a methyl group to account for one of the methyl singlets (e.g., at δ 2.31) and the para-substitution pattern. This gives us a **p-tolyl group (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-)**.\n    *   The other methyl group (e.g., at δ 2.28) is a singlet, suggesting it's part of an acetyl group **(-C(=O)-CH₃)**.\n    *   Now, we connect the remaining pieces: the p-tolyl group, the acetyl group, and the -CH=CH- bridge. The only logical way to connect them to form a stable molecule is:\n        **p-tolyl - CH=CH - C(=O) - CH₃**\n    *   This structure is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**. Let's verify it matches the data.\n        *   Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n        *   ¹H NMR: A singlet for the p-tolyl methyl, a singlet for the acetyl methyl, two doublets for the p-disubstituted aromatic protons, and two doublets for the vinylic protons. This perfectly matches the splitting patterns.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two methyl carbons, one ketone carbon, and six sp² carbons (four for the aromatic ring, which appear as four signals due to symmetry, and two for the alkene). This matches the number and types of signals.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X**\n\nNow that we know the product, we can determine the starting material, Compound X. The reaction is an isomerization of X to (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one, catalyzed by DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) at high temperature. All candidates are vinyl epoxides. We need to find which candidate can rearrange to our identified product.\n\n*   **Product Skeleton:** p-tolyl-C-C-C-C\n*   **Candidate Skeletons:**\n    *   A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: `Ph-C(CH₃)=C-(oxirane)`. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Ruled out.\n    *   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: `Ph-CH=CH-(methyl-oxirane)`. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Ruled out.\n    *   C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: `p-tolyl-CH=CH-(oxirane)`. This has the correct **p-tolyl** group and a C₄ chain skeleton. This is the only plausible candidate.\n    *   D) 2-styrylepoxide: Assuming the most common structure `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`, this is C₁₀H₁₀O, which has the wrong molecular formula. Ruled out.\n\n*   **The Transformation:**\n    The reaction must be the isomerization of Compound C to the product.\n    *   **Reactant X (Compound C):** 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, which is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄ - CH=CH - CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   **Product:** `p-CH₃-C₆H₄ - CH=CH - C(=O) - CH₃`.\n    *   This reaction involves the transformation of the `-CH(O)CH₂` (terminal epoxide) group into a `-C(=O)CH₃` (methyl ketone) group. This is a known type of rearrangement for vinyl epoxides, which can be catalyzed by bases or nucleophiles like DABCO. The DABCO can act as a nucleophilic catalyst to facilitate the opening of the epoxide ring, followed by elimination and tautomerization to form the conjugated ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the product of the reaction is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material with the correct p-tolyl C₄ skeleton is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Therefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
