    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe goal is to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and assess the renormalizability of the theory described by the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n**Step 1: Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we work in natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$. In this system, mass, energy, and momentum have dimensions of mass ($M^1$), while length and time have dimensions of inverse mass ($M^{-1}$).\n\nThe action, $S$, is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$, over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nFor the path integral formalism to be well-defined, the action $S$ must be a dimensionless quantity.\nThe spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of (length)$^4$, which corresponds to a mass dimension of $[d^4x]_M = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\n\nSince the action must be dimensionless ($[S]_M = M^0$), the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension that cancels out the dimension of $d^4x$.\n$[S]_M = [\\mathcal{L}]_M + [d^4x]_M = M^0$\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M + (-4) = 0$\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\n**Step 2: Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nWe determine the mass dimension of each field by examining their respective kinetic terms in a standard Lagrangian. The kinetic terms must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion, kin} = \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has the dimension of momentum, so $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices.\n    *   The dimension of the term must be 4: $[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$, we have $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$.\n    *   This gives $2[\\psi]_M = 3$, so the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM, kin} = -\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be 4: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian: $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\nThe mass dimension of this term must also be 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**Step 4: Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed by examining the mass dimensions of its coupling constants (this is known as power-counting renormalizability). The rule is as follows:\n\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a **positive** mass dimension ($[g]_M > 0$), the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a **zero** mass dimension ($[g]_M = 0$), the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a **negative** mass dimension ($[g]_M < 0$), the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is $\\kappa$, and we found its mass dimension to be $[\\kappa]_M = -1$. Since the dimension is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nA negative mass dimension implies that as we calculate higher-order corrections in perturbation theory (i.e., diagrams with more loops and vertices), the divergences become progressively worse. To cancel these new, more severe types of infinities at each order, an infinite number of new counterterms would be required, making the theory lose its predictive power.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the dimension of the operator $O = \\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Its mass dimension is $[O]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 3/2 + 3/2 + 0 + 2 = 5$. Since the operator dimension (5) is greater than the spacetime dimension (4), the theory is non-renormalizable. The coupling constant $\\kappa$ has dimension $4-5=-1$ to make the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\kappa O$ have the correct dimension of 4.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   The theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
