The formula is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation in a structured manner.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory\n\nThis is a critical first step where any error would propagate through the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count of the atoms gives:\n    *   **12 Carbon (C) atoms**\n    *   **22 Hydrogen (H) atoms**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n*   **Bond Count**: We must count the number of each type of bond in one molecule.\n    *   There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   There are two double bonds explicitly shown (`C=C`), so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds: 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThis step involves finding the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states (`12 C(s)` and `11 H₂(g)`) into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen gas (by breaking H-H bonds): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value is also the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nNow we apply the main formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = (Total Reactant Atomization Energy) - (Total Product Bond Energy)\n*   **ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 5: Unit Conversion and Final Answer Selection\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation is `1900 kJ/mol`. We must now carefully examine the given options.\n*   **Option A) 11200 kJ/mol**: This is a common distractor. It is the value for the total bond energy of the product (calculated in Step 3), not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   **Option B) 67.4 kJ/mol**: This value is not derived from any part of the calculation.\n*   **Option D) 1900 kJ/g**: This is another distractor. While the numerical value `1900` is correct, the units are `kJ/g`, but our calculation yielded `kJ/mol`. An answer must be correct in both value and unit.\n*   **Option C) 11.44 kJ/g**: Since our molar value does not match any option and this option is in `kJ/g`, we must perform a unit conversion.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using standard integer atomic weights (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) is appropriate for this type of problem.\n*   Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNext, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**, which exactly matches Option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of a complex hydrocarbon molecule from provided thermochemical data. All the provided candidate answers follow the same correct logical procedure, confirming a strong consensus on the method. The key is to execute each step with precision and to identify and avoid the distractors deliberately placed within the answer options.\n\nThe fundamental formula, derived from Hess's Law, is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis that consolidates the reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory\n\nThis is the foundational step, and any error here would invalidate the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule:** (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂\n*   **Atom Count:** A careful count of the atoms yields:\n    *   12 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   22 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   The correct molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **22 C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **2 C=C bonds**: The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **9 C-C bonds**: For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of linkages between carbon atoms is the number of carbons minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds (11 - 2 = 9).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThis step involves calculating the energy needed to convert the elements from their standard states into individual gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value also represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Distractor):** This intermediate value, 11200 kJ/mol, exactly matches **Option C** in the prompt. It is a common mistake to stop the calculation here, mistaking the product's enthalpy of atomization for its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nNow we apply the main formula using the results from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Distractor):** The numerical value `1900` matches **Option B** in the prompt, but the units in that option are `kJ/g`. Our calculated value is in `kJ/mol`. This is a unit-mismatch trap.\n\n### Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer\n\nSince the molar enthalpy of formation (1900 kJ/mol) does not match any option directly when units are considered, we must perform a unit conversion. Option D is in kJ/g, which prompts this final step.\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using standard integer masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) is appropriate for this problem's data.\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, convert the enthalpy of formation from a molar basis (kJ/mol) to a specific basis (kJ/g):\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This result precisely matches **Option D**.\n\nBased on the thorough, step-by-step analysis that aligns with the consensus reasoning of the provided answers, the final correct answer is obtained after completing the full calculation and performing the necessary unit conversion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem requiring the calculation of the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) from given thermochemical data. The solution involves a systematic, multi-step application of Hess's Law. An analysis of the candidate answers shows a complete consensus on the correct calculation method.\n\nThe fundamental formula used is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation with the key points highlighted.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\nThis is the foundational step where accuracy is critical.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count of the atoms yields:\n    *   **12 Carbon (C) atoms**\n    *   **22 Hydrogen (H) atoms**\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n*   **Bond Count**: We must count the number of each type of bond within one molecule.\n    *   There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, which means there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   The structure explicitly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining 11 - 2 = **9 are single C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is: `12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`. The energy needed to convert these reactants into individual gaseous atoms is calculated as follows:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of C(s): `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break bonds in 11 moles of H₂(g): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. It is also the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point #1 (Distractor):** This intermediate value, `11200 kJ/mol`, exactly matches **Option A**. This is a common trap for students who stop the calculation here, mistaking the product's enthalpy of atomization for its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nNow, we apply the main formula using the results from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point #2 (Distractor):** The numerical value of this result, `1900`, matches **Option C**. However, Option C has units of `kJ/g`, while the calculated value is in `kJ/mol`. This is a unit mismatch, making it another distractor.\n\n### **Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation (1900 kJ/mol) does not appear as a valid option. We must convert the result to `kJ/g` to compare with the remaining options. To do this, we first need the molar mass of the compound.\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂**: Using standard integer masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol):\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert to kJ/g**: We divide the molar enthalpy by the molar mass. The calculation `1900 / 166` yields `11.4457...`. Rounding to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value perfectly matches **Option B**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe complete and correct calculation involves all five steps. Avoiding the distractors in options A and C and performing the final unit conversion leads to the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given hydrocarbon using bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. A systematic analysis is crucial to arrive at the correct answer and to identify the intentionally placed \"distractor\" options.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe standard formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation from atomization and bond energy data is derived from Hess's Law:\n\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis first step is foundational, as any error will propagate through the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count of the atoms reveals:\n    *   12 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   22 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n*   **Bond Count**:\n    *   **C-H bonds**: Equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds**: For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n*Careful Point 1*: An error in this initial count is a common mistake. The count (C₁₂H₂₂, 9 C-C, 2 C=C, 22 C-H) is correct.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThis step calculates the energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states (`12 C(s)` and `11 H₂(g)`) into individual gaseous atoms (`12 C(g)` and `22 H(g)`).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break bonds in 11 moles of Hydrogen gas: `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the C₁₂H₂₂ product molecule.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n*Careful Point 2 (Distractor Analysis)*: This value, **11200 kJ/mol**, represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not its enthalpy of formation. This value matches **Option A** and is a common distractor for students who stop the calculation prematurely.\n\n**4. Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the primary formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n*Careful Point 3 (Distractor Analysis)*: The numerical value `1900` matches **Option B**. However, the units in Option B are `kJ/g`, while our calculation resulted in `kJ/mol`. This is a second common distractor testing attention to units.\n\n**5. Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\n\nSince our calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) does not directly match any option when units are considered, and Option D is given in kJ/g, we must perform a unit conversion.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂**: Using the standard integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) is appropriate for a problem with such rounded data:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert to Specific Enthalpy (kJ/g)**:\n    ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nRounding the result to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value precisely matches **Option D**. Option C is unrelated to any of the calculated values and serves only as a distractor.\n\nBy methodically proceeding through all five steps and avoiding the two primary distractors (the intermediate value in Option A and the wrong units in Option B), we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given hydrocarbon using Hess's Law and the provided thermochemical data. The consensus reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and follows a standard, correct procedure. The key to arriving at the right answer is executing each step accurately and recognizing the distractors deliberately placed in the options.\n\nThe fundamental formula for this calculation is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the calculation:\n\n### **Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis is the foundational step; any error here will propagate through the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\n*   **Atom Count**:\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 12\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 22\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n*   **Bond Inventory**:\n    *   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds.

It is listed as **Option C** and is a classic distractor for those who stop the calculation prematurely.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the main formula from the start.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Distractor #2.** The numerical value `1900` is listed as **Option D**, but with incorrect units (`kJ/g` instead of `kJ/mol`).

This value represents the product's enthalpy of atomization.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Distractor Value.** This intermediate value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches **Option A**. This is a common pitfall; this is the product's enthalpy of atomization, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nNow, we apply the main formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point 2: Distractor Value with Incorrect Units.** The numerical value of this result, `1900`, is listed in **Option C**. However, the units in Option C are kJ/g, whereas our calculated value is in kJ/mol. This is a second distractor that tests for careful attention to units.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation (1900 kJ/mol) does not correctly match any of the options as is. We must convert it to kJ/g to compare with Option D.\n\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using standard integer atomic masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) is appropriate for a problem with integer-based data.\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g. The previous calculation (`1900 / 166`) gave the result `11.44578...`\n*   ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.45 kJ/g**\n*   Rounding to two decimal places gives 11.45 kJ/g. However, **Option D** is **11.44 kJ/g**. This value is extremely close to our calculated value, and the other options have been identified as clear distractors corresponding to specific errors. Therefore, D is the intended answer. The slight discrepancy is likely due to truncation or rounding in the problem's design.\n\nAfter a complete and careful calculation, including avoiding the distractors and performing the necessary unit conversion, the correct answer is unambiguously identified as the closest option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given hydrocarbon using the provided thermochemical data.

This is a common pitfall where one stops the calculation prematurely.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nNow we apply the main formula from the start.\n*   ΔH_f = (Total Reactant Atomization Energy) - (Total Product Bond Energy)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n*   **Careful Point #2 (Distractor):** The numerical value `1900` is presented in **Option D**, but with incorrect units (`kJ/g`). A correct answer must have both the correct value and the correct units.\n\n### **Step 5: Convert Units to Find the Correct Answer**\nOur calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) does not match any of the options precisely.

It represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not the enthalpy of formation. This corresponds to **Option C**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\nNow we apply the main formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = (Total Reactant Atomization Energy) - (Total Product Bond Energy)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point (Distractor #2)**: The numerical value `1900` appears in **Option D**, but with incorrect units (`kJ/g`). This is another distractor testing attention to units, as our calculation resulted in `kJ/mol`.\n\n### Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer\nThe calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) does not directly match any of the options when units are considered. We must perform a unit conversion to `kJ/g` to check against the remaining options.\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using standard integer masses (C=12, H=1) is appropriate for this type of problem.\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, convert the molar enthalpy of formation to specific enthalpy (per gram):\n    ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value correctly matches **Option B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus method from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\nThe fundamental formula to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) from atomization energies and bond energies is derived from Hess's Law:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nThe calculation proceeds in several sequential steps:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\nFirst, we must correctly analyze the chemical structure of the molecule to count all atoms and bonds.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count of the atoms reveals:\n    *   **12 Carbon (C) atoms**\n    *   **22 Hydrogen (H) atoms**\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n*   **Bond Count**: We then count the number of each type of bond within one molecule:\n    *   There are **2 C=C** bonds (carbon-carbon double bonds).\n    *   For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-to-carbon bonds is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds: 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n    *   The number of **C-H bonds** is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\nThe formation reaction involves forming the molecule from its constituent elements in their standard states: `12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`. We calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen gas (i.e., break 11 moles of H-H bonds): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\nThis is the total energy required to break all the chemical bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value is also known as the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nUsing the main formula, we subtract the energy of the product bonds from the energy of the reactant atoms.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated molar enthalpy is `1900 kJ/mol`. We must now compare this to the provided options. Since one of the options is in kJ/g, a unit conversion is necessary.\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂**: Using integer atomic masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) which is standard for this type of problem:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert kJ/mol to kJ/g**:\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Options\n\nThis problem is designed with several \"traps\" or \"distractors\" that correspond to common errors:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Distractor A)**: The value `11200 kJ/mol` (Option A) is an intermediate result from Step 3. It represents the enthalpy of atomization of the *product*, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Distractor D)**: The value `1900 kJ/g` (Option D) uses the correct numerical result from the molar enthalpy calculation (Step 4) but pairs it with the incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Correct Answer C)**: The final correct answer, `11.44 kJ/g` (Option C), is only found after completing all steps, including the final unit conversion.\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Distractor B)**: The value `67.4 kJ/mol` (Option B) is unrelated to any step of the calculation and serves only as a distractor.\n\nBy systematically following all steps and carefully checking the units, the correct answer is unambiguously identified.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a systematic calculation of the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the given molecule using Hess's Law and the provided thermochemical data. The consensus among the various agents' reasoning points to a single, correct methodology, which is verified below.\n\nThe governing formula for this calculation is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, highlighting the careful points and potential pitfalls.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis is the foundational step where accuracy is critical.\n*   **Molecule**: (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count reveals **12 Carbon atoms** and **22 Hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n*   **Bond Count**:\n    *   There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   The structure shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is C-1, so 12 - 1 = 11. With 2 of these being double bonds, the remaining 11 - 2 = **9 are C-C single bonds**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Correctly counting the atoms and bonds is the most important initial step. Any error here would invalidate the entire calculation. All agents analyzed this correctly.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n`12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`\nThe energy required to convert these reactants into individual gaseous atoms is calculated as follows:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break bonds in 11 moles of H₂(g): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy needed to break all bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value also represents the product's enthalpy of atomization.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point 2 (Distractor):** The value `11200 kJ/mol` is a common distractor. It is the total bond energy of the product (an intermediate value), not the final enthalpy of formation. This value matches **Option C**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the primary formula using the results from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point 3 (Distractor):** The numerical value `1900` is also a distractor. It appears in **Option A**, but with incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). An answer must have both the correct value and the correct unit.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) does not directly match any option when units are considered. We must perform a unit conversion to compare it with Option B, which is in kJ/g.\n*   First, we need the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using standard integer masses (C=12, H=1):\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, we convert the molar enthalpy to specific enthalpy (per gram):\n    ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\n**Careful Point 4:** A final unit conversion is essential to solve this problem. Rounding the result to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value precisely matches **Option B**.\n\nOption D (67.4 kJ/mol) is unrelated to any part of the calculation. A complete and careful execution of all steps leads to the conclusion that the only correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe task is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the molecule (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂ using the provided thermochemical data. The solution requires a systematic, multi-step application of Hess's Law.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nAll provided candidate answers follow the same correct methodology. The analysis below synthesizes their reasoning and verifies the final answer. The governing formula for this calculation is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis is the foundational step; any error here will invalidate the final result.\n*   **Molecule**: (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count reveals:\n    *   **12 Carbon (C) atoms**\n    *   **22 Hydrogen (H) atoms**\n*   **Molecular Formula**: This gives the molecular formula **C₁₂H₂₂**. The balanced formation reaction involves **12 moles of C(s)** and **11 moles of H₂(g)**.\n\n*   **Bond Count**: We must count every bond in one molecule:\n    *   **22 C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **2 C=C bonds**: The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **9 C-C bonds**: For a non-cyclic (acyclic) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds (11 - 2 = 9).\n\n**Careful Point #1**: An incorrect count of atoms or bonds is the most common source of error. This step was performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThis step calculates the energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states (`12 C(s)` and `11 H₂(g)`) into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen gas (i.e., break 11 mol of H-H bonds): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the chemical bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value also represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point #2**: This value, **11200 kJ/mol**, is a common distractor. It matches **Option B** and represents an intermediate calculation (the enthalpy of atomization of the product), not the final enthalpy of formation.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the main formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = `13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol`\n\n**Careful Point #3**: The numerical value `1900` is also used as a distractor. It appears in **Option C**, but with incorrect units (`kJ/g` instead of `kJ/mol`). A correct answer must have both the correct value and the correct units.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Determine the Final Answer**\n\nOur calculated molar enthalpy (`1900 kJ/mol`) does not match any of the options correctly. We must convert it to `kJ/g` to compare with Option D.\n*   First, we need the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using the integer atomic masses given the nature of the data (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol):\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, we perform the unit conversion:\n    ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value precisely matches **Option D**. Option A (67.4 kJ/mol) is unrelated to any part of the calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA complete and systematic analysis, which confirms the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers, shows that the correct enthalpy of formation is 11.44 kJ/g.

A systematic analysis of the problem, incorporating the unanimous reasoning of the provided answers, is crucial to arrive at the correct solution.\n\nThe fundamental formula, based on Hess's Law, is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation and the associated careful points.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis is a critical foundational step where any error would invalidate the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count of all atoms gives:\n    *   **12 Carbon (C) atoms**\n    *   **22 Hydrogen (H) atoms**\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂.

Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = 9.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: An error in this initial counting step is a common and critical pitfall. The entire calculation is based on this inventory. All provided answers correctly performed this step.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThis step calculates the total energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen gas (by breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value is also the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point 2 (Distractor A)**: This intermediate value, `11200 kJ/mol`, exactly matches option A. It is a common mistake to stop the calculation here, mistaking the product's enthalpy of atomization for its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the main formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point 3 (Distractor B)**: The numerical value `1900` from this step matches option B. However, the units in option B are `kJ/g`, while the calculated value is in `kJ/mol`. An answer must be correct in both its value and its units.\n\n### **Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation (1900 kJ/mol) does not match any remaining options directly.

The key is to execute each step with precision and to identify and avoid the distractors deliberately placed within the answer options.\n\nThe fundamental formula, derived from Hess's Law, is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis that consolidates the reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory\n\nThis is the foundational step, and any error here would invalidate the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule:** (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂\n*   **Atom Count:** A careful count of the atoms yields:\n    *   12 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   22 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   The correct molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **22 C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **2 C=C bonds**: The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **9 C-C bonds**: For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of linkages between carbon atoms is the number of carbons minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds (11 - 2 = 9).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThis step involves calculating the energy needed to convert the elements from their standard states into individual gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value also represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Distractor):** This intermediate value, 11200 kJ/mol, exactly matches **Option C** in the prompt. It is a common mistake to stop the calculation here, mistaking the product's enthalpy of atomization for its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nNow we apply the main formula using the results from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Distractor):** The numerical value `1900` matches **Option B** in the prompt, but the units in that option are `kJ/g`. Our calculated value is in `kJ/mol`. This is a unit-mismatch trap.\n\n### Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer\n\nSince the molar enthalpy of formation (1900 kJ/mol) does not match any option directly when units are considered, we must perform a unit conversion. Option D is in kJ/g, which prompts this final step.\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using standard integer masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) is appropriate for this problem's data.\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, convert the enthalpy of formation from a molar basis (kJ/mol) to a specific basis (kJ/g):\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This result precisely matches **Option D**.\n\nBased on the thorough, step-by-step analysis that aligns with the consensus reasoning of the provided answers, the final correct answer is obtained after completing the full calculation and performing the necessary unit conversion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem requiring the calculation of the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) from given thermochemical data. The solution involves a systematic, multi-step application of Hess's Law. An analysis of the candidate answers shows a complete consensus on the correct calculation method.\n\nThe fundamental formula used is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation with the key points highlighted.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\nThis is the foundational step where accuracy is critical.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count of the atoms yields:\n    *   **12 Carbon (C) atoms**\n    *   **22 Hydrogen (H) atoms**\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n*   **Bond Count**: We must count the number of each type of bond within one molecule.\n    *   There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, which means there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   The structure explicitly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining 11 - 2 = **9 are single C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is: `12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`. The energy needed to convert these reactants into individual gaseous atoms is calculated as follows:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of C(s): `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break bonds in 11 moles of H₂(g): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. It is also the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point #1 (Distractor):** This intermediate value, `11200 kJ/mol`, exactly matches **Option A**. This is a common trap for students who stop the calculation here, mistaking the product's enthalpy of atomization for its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nNow, we apply the main formula using the results from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point #2 (Distractor):** The numerical value of this result, `1900`, matches **Option C**. However, Option C has units of `kJ/g`, while the calculated value is in `kJ/mol`. This is a unit mismatch, making it another distractor.\n\n### **Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation (1900 kJ/mol) does not appear as a valid option. We must convert the result to `kJ/g` to compare with the remaining options. To do this, we first need the molar mass of the compound.\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂**: Using standard integer masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol):\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert to kJ/g**: We divide the molar enthalpy by the molar mass. The calculation `1900 / 166` yields `11.4457...`. Rounding to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value perfectly matches **Option B**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe complete and correct calculation involves all five steps. Avoiding the distractors in options A and C and performing the final unit conversion leads to the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given hydrocarbon using bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon.

Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis first step is foundational, as any error will propagate through the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count of the atoms reveals:\n    *   12 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   22 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n*   **Bond Count**:\n    *   **C-H bonds**: Equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds**: For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n*Careful Point 1*: An error in this initial count is a common mistake. The count (C₁₂H₂₂, 9 C-C, 2 C=C, 22 C-H) is correct.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThis step calculates the energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states (`12 C(s)` and `11 H₂(g)`) into individual gaseous atoms (`12 C(g)` and `22 H(g)`).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break bonds in 11 moles of Hydrogen gas: `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n**3.

This value matches **Option A** and is a common distractor for students who stop the calculation prematurely.\n\n**4. Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the primary formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n*Careful Point 3 (Distractor Analysis)*: The numerical value `1900` matches **Option B**. However, the units in Option B are `kJ/g`, while our calculation resulted in `kJ/mol`. This is a second common distractor testing attention to units.\n\n**5. Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\n\nSince our calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) does not directly match any option when units are considered, and Option D is given in kJ/g, we must perform a unit conversion.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂**: Using the standard integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) is appropriate for a problem with such rounded data:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert to Specific Enthalpy (kJ/g)**:\n    ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nRounding the result to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value precisely matches **Option D**. Option C is unrelated to any of the calculated values and serves only as a distractor.\n\nBy methodically proceeding through all five steps and avoiding the two primary distractors (the intermediate value in Option A and the wrong units in Option B), we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given hydrocarbon using Hess's Law and the provided thermochemical data.

This result matches Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of an organic molecule using provided thermochemical data. All the provided candidate answers correctly identify the same systematic method. The final decision is based on a careful execution of each step and the avoidance of common distractors deliberately placed in the options.\n\nThe fundamental formula to use, derived from Hess's Law, is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation and the crucial points to consider:\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis is the most critical initial step, as any error here will propagate through the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`\n*   **Atom Count**:\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = **12**\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = **22**\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n*   **Bond Count**:\n    *   There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, which means there must be **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). As two of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThis step calculates the energy needed to convert the elements in their standard states into individual gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`.\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen (breaking 11 mol of H-H bonds): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule.

This is a common pitfall. This value is an intermediate result (the enthalpy of atomization of the product), not the final enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the main formula from the start.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Distractor):** The numerical value `1900` is presented in **Option A**. However, the units in Option A are `kJ/g`, while the calculated value has units of `kJ/mol`.

An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the correct calculation method. This analysis will verify that method, highlight potential pitfalls, and determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n### **The Fundamental Equation**\n\nThe calculation is based on Hess's Law, using the following formula:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nThis formula essentially states that the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms minus the energy released when those atoms form the product.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nThis is the most critical first step, as any error will propagate through the entire calculation.\n*   **Molecule**: `(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count reveals:\n    *   **12 Carbon (C)** atoms\n    *   **22 Hydrogen (H)** atoms\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n*   **Bond Count**:\n    *   **C-H bonds**: Equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds**: For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n***Careful Point #1:*** This foundational step must be performed accurately. An error in counting atoms or bonds will lead to a completely incorrect final answer.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThis step calculates the energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states (`12 C(s)` and `11 H₂(g)`) into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n***Careful Point #2 (Distractor):*** This intermediate value, `11200 kJ/mol`, is a common pitfall.

This value matches **Option D**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the main formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n***Careful Point #3 (Distractor):*** The numerical value `1900` is presented in **Option A** (`1900 kJ/g`). This is another distractor that pairs the correct numerical value for the *molar* enthalpy with incorrect units.

Using standard integer atomic masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) is appropriate for this type of problem.\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\n    ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation. When rounding this value to two decimal places, we get 11.45 kJ/g.

Since two of these are double bonds, the remaining linkages must be single bonds: 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: Any error in this initial counting step will lead to an incorrect final answer. This is the foundation of the entire calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\nThis step calculates the energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states (`12 C(s)` and `11 H₂(g)`) into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen gas (i.e., break 11 moles of H-H bonds): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value is equivalent to the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point (Distractor #1)**: This value, **11200 kJ/mol**, is a common distractor.

We must now compare this to the provided options. Since one of the options is in kJ/g, a unit conversion is necessary.\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂**: Using integer atomic masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) which is standard for this type of problem:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert kJ/mol to kJ/g**:\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Options\n\nThis problem is designed with several \"traps\" or \"distractors\" that correspond to common errors:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Distractor A)**: The value `11200 kJ/mol` (Option A) is an intermediate result from Step 3. It represents the enthalpy of atomization of the *product*, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Distractor D)**: The value `1900 kJ/g` (Option D) uses the correct numerical result from the molar enthalpy calculation (Step 4) but pairs it with the incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Correct Answer C)**: The final correct answer, `11.44 kJ/g` (Option C), is only found after completing all steps, including the final unit conversion.\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Distractor B)**: The value `67.4 kJ/mol` (Option B) is unrelated to any step of the calculation and serves only as a distractor.\n\nBy systematically following all steps and carefully checking the units, the correct answer is unambiguously identified.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a systematic calculation of the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the given molecule using Hess's Law and the provided thermochemical data. The consensus among the various agents' reasoning points to a single, correct methodology, which is verified below.\n\nThe governing formula for this calculation is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, highlighting the careful points and potential pitfalls.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis is the foundational step where accuracy is critical.\n*   **Molecule**: (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count reveals **12 Carbon atoms** and **22 Hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₂H₂₂\n*   **Bond Count**:\n    *   There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   The structure shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is C-1, so 12 - 1 = 11. With 2 of these being double bonds, the remaining 11 - 2 = **9 are C-C single bonds**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Correctly counting the atoms and bonds is the most important initial step. Any error here would invalidate the entire calculation. All agents analyzed this correctly.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n`12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`\nThe energy required to convert these reactants into individual gaseous atoms is calculated as follows:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to break bonds in 11 moles of H₂(g): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy needed to break all bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value also represents the product's enthalpy of atomization.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point 2 (Distractor):** The value `11200 kJ/mol` is a common distractor. It is the total bond energy of the product (an intermediate value), not the final enthalpy of formation. This value matches **Option C**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the primary formula using the results from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point 3 (Distractor):** The numerical value `1900` is also a distractor. It appears in **Option A**, but with incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). An answer must have both the correct value and the correct unit.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) does not directly match any option when units are considered. We must perform a unit conversion to compare it with Option B, which is in kJ/g.\n*   First, we need the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using standard integer masses (C=12, H=1):\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, we convert the molar enthalpy to specific enthalpy (per gram):\n    ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\n**Careful Point 4:** A final unit conversion is essential to solve this problem. Rounding the result to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value precisely matches **Option B**.\n\nOption D (67.4 kJ/mol) is unrelated to any part of the calculation. A complete and careful execution of all steps leads to the conclusion that the only correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe task is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the molecule (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂ using the provided thermochemical data. The solution requires a systematic, multi-step application of Hess's Law.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nAll provided candidate answers follow the same correct methodology. The analysis below synthesizes their reasoning and verifies the final answer. The governing formula for this calculation is:\n**ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product)]**\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula and Bond Inventory**\n\nThis is the foundational step; any error here will invalidate the final result.\n*   **Molecule**: (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂\n*   **Atom Count**: A careful count reveals:\n    *   **12 Carbon (C) atoms**\n    *   **22 Hydrogen (H) atoms**\n*   **Molecular Formula**: This gives the molecular formula **C₁₂H₂₂**. The balanced formation reaction involves **12 moles of C(s)** and **11 moles of H₂(g)**.\n\n*   **Bond Count**: We must count every bond in one molecule:\n    *   **22 C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **2 C=C bonds**: The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **9 C-C bonds**: For a non-cyclic (acyclic) hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon linkages is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds (11 - 2 = 9).\n\n**Careful Point #1**: An incorrect count of atoms or bonds is the most common source of error. This step was performed correctly by all candidate answers.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThis step calculates the energy required to convert the constituent elements from their standard states (`12 C(s)` and `11 H₂(g)`) into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: `12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ`\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of Hydrogen gas (i.e., break 11 mol of H-H bonds): `11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ`\n*   **Total Reactant Atomization Energy = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the chemical bonds in one mole of the product molecule. This value also represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: `9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ`\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: `2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ`\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: `22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ`\n*   **Total Product Bond Energy = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point #2**: This value, **11200 kJ/mol**, is a common distractor. It matches **Option B** and represents an intermediate calculation (the enthalpy of atomization of the product), not the final enthalpy of formation.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nNow we apply the main formula using the values from Step 2 and Step 3.\n*   ΔH_f = [Total Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Total Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔH_f = `13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol`\n\n**Careful Point #3**: The numerical value `1900` is also used as a distractor. It appears in **Option C**, but with incorrect units (`kJ/g` instead of `kJ/mol`). A correct answer must have both the correct value and the correct units.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Determine the Final Answer**\n\nOur calculated molar enthalpy (`1900 kJ/mol`) does not match any of the options correctly. We must convert it to `kJ/g` to compare with Option D.\n*   First, we need the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂. Using the integer atomic masses given the nature of the data (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol):\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Next, we perform the unit conversion:\n    ΔH_f (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives **11.44 kJ/g**. This value precisely matches **Option D**. Option A (67.4 kJ/mol) is unrelated to any part of the calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA complete and systematic analysis, which confirms the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers, shows that the correct enthalpy of formation is 11.44 kJ/g. This requires performing all calculation steps correctly and carefully avoiding the two major distractors present in the options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
