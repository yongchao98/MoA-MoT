The reasoning in each case is sound and arrives at the same conclusion, with minor differences in the final letter choice stemming only from the shuffled order of the options presented to each agent.\n\nThe correct approach involves systematically breaking down the molecule into its constituent parts based on the spectroscopic evidence provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Aromatic Core and Oxygen Content Identification (C₆H₄O₂)**\n*   **Information**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" The FTIR confirms an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Deduction**: This establishes a benzene ring core where two hydrogens have been replaced, leaving a `C₆H₄` fragment. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens. The ester group (`-COO-`) accounts for the 2 oxygen atoms (`O₂`).\n\n**2. First Substituent Identification (Propenyl Group, C₃H₅)**\n*   **Information**: The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n*   **Deduction**: This specific signal pattern is a definitive fingerprint for a substituent group.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpreting the Splitting Pattern.** The \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) signal arises when a vinyl proton is coupled to one other vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and three protons of an adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet). This unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)** as one of the substituents. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`C₃H₅`) and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n**3. Second Substituent Identification (Methyl Group, CH₃)**\n*   **Information**: The ¹H NMR shows a second `-CH₃` signal but, crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n*   **Deduction**: We have already assigned one `-CH₃` to the propenyl group. The second `-CH₃` must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Importance of Negative Evidence.** The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a critical piece of evidence. It eliminates the possibility of common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). This means the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming a structure such as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). This fragment contributes 1 carbon (the methyl C) and 3 hydrogens (`CH₃`). Note that the ester's carbonyl carbon was implicitly part of the functional group and now is explicitly accounted for alongside this methyl group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Molecular Formula**\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can calculate the complete formula:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl):** The ester (`-COO-`) contributes C and 2O. The methyl (`-CH₃`) contributes C and 3H. So, this whole substituent is `C₂H₃O₂`.\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester/methyl) = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester methyl) = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification**\n*   **Careful Point 3: Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).** As a final check, the DBE for C₁₁H₁₂O₂ is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6`. This matches the structural features: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = 6. The perfect match confirms the analysis.\n\nMatching the derived formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` to the provided options:\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the final answer, we must systematically analyze the spectroscopic data provided. The candidate answers all follow a similar and correct logical path, which involves breaking down the unknown molecule into its constituent fragments based on the data, and then summing the atoms to find the final formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying the Core Aromatic Fragment (C₆H₄)**\n*   **Information**: The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is confirmed by the ¹H NMR spectrum, which shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\".\n*   **Deduction**: A standard benzene ring is C₆H₆. When it is di-substituted, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups. This leaves a core fragment with the chemical formula **C₆H₄**. The four remaining protons account for the two signals observed in the NMR.\n*   **Atoms Accounted For**: 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens.\n\n**2. Identifying the Oxygen-Containing Functional Group (Ester, O₂)**\n*   **Information**: The FTIR spectrum clearly indicates the presence of an **ester group**.\n*   **Deduction**: An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R'. This immediately accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** present in all the candidate formulas.\n*   **Atoms Accounted For**: 2 oxygens.\n\n**3. Decoding the Substituents with ¹H NMR (The Crucial Clues)**\nThis step requires careful analysis of the splitting patterns and chemical shifts described.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (`C₃H₅`) is revealed by its unique NMR signature.**\n    *   **Information**: The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction**: This specific and complex splitting pattern is an unambiguous fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton attached to the same carbon as the methyl group is split by its single vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, so it appears as a simple \"doublet\". This substituent also accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` groups mentioned.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For**: 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The second substituent is identified by integrating the remaining NMR data, including the critical \"negative evidence\".**\n    *   **Information**: The spectrum shows a second, distinct `-CH₃` signal, but explicitly states there are \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction**: We have already assigned one substituent as a propenyl group. The second substituent must therefore contain the ester and the second methyl group. The absence of a `-CH₂-` signal is a powerful constraint. It rules out common ester formations like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). This forces the second methyl group to be directly bonded to the ester functionality. This can be either a methyl ester fragment (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy fragment (`-O-CO-CH₃`). In either case, the fragment contributes one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, and three hydrogens.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For**: 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens.\n\n**4. Assembling the Complete Molecular Formula**\nNow, we sum the atomic contributions from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl):** C₂H₃ (plus the O₂ already counted)\n\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Answer Selection**\n*   **Careful Point 3: The result is confirmed by checking the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).**\n    *   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    *   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = 6.\n    *   The values match perfectly, validating the entire analysis.\n\n*   **Matching with Options:** We compare our derived formula, `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`, to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nA comprehensive analysis of the spectroscopic data is required to determine the correct chemical formula. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers is uniformly logical and leads to the same molecular formula. The correct approach involves systematically breaking down the molecule into its constituent fragments based on the evidence provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Aromatic Core and Oxygen Content**:\n    *   **Evidence**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The FTIR spectrum confirms an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n    *   **Deduction**: A di-substituted benzene ring provides a core fragment of **C₆H₄**. The four protons remaining on this ring account for the two NMR signals. The ester group (-COO-) accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the formula.\n    *   **Atom Count**: This establishes a base of C₆H₄O₂.\n\n2.  **First Substituent - The Propenyl Group**:\n    *   **Evidence**: The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Careful Point 1**: This specific splitting pattern is a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating the doublet) *and* by the three methyl protons (creating the quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, appearing as a simple doublet.\n    *   **Atom Count**: This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` groups.\n\n3.  **Second Substituent - The Methyl Ester Fragment**:\n    *   **Evidence**: The ¹H NMR shows a second `-CH₃` signal but, crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Careful Point 2**: This piece of negative evidence is critical. It rules out structures containing a methylene (`-CH₂-`) bridge, such as an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Since one methyl group is in the propenyl fragment, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This could be a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n    *   **Atom Count**: Either arrangement contributes the same atoms: one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, and three hydrogens, for a fragment of **C₂H₃**.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Final Molecular Formula**:\n    *   By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can calculate the complete formula.\n    *   **Fragments**: `C₆H₄` (aromatic ring) + `C₃H₅` (propenyl group) + `C₂H₃` and `O₂` (ester/methyl part)\n    *   **Total Carbons (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O)**: **2**\n    *   The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection**:\n    *   **Careful Point 3**: A final check using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) confirms the result's consistency. For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, the DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the structural features: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O bond (1 DBE) = 6.\n    *   The deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be matched against the original options.\n\n**Options**:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a collective analysis of the candidate answers, all of which arrive at the same chemical formula through sound and consistent reasoning, a definitive answer can be determined. The method involves systematically deconstructing the provided spectroscopic data to identify the molecular fragments and then assembling them to find the overall formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Aromatic Ring and Oxygen Content**\n*   The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H,\" which accounts for the four protons on a di-substituted benzene ring. This identifies the molecular core.\n*   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an \"ester group\" (`-COO-`), which accounts for the two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Core Fragment.** The very first step is to establish the base of the molecule. A di-substituted benzene ring has the formula **C₆H₄**. This accounts for **6 carbons** and **4 hydrogens**.\n\n**2. Decoding the Substituents with ¹H NMR**\nThis is the most critical phase, where specific NMR signals are translated into structural fragments.\n*   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n*   **Reasoning:** This highly specific splitting pattern is a definitive fingerprint that can only correspond to a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by both its single vinyl neighbor (the doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (the quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\".\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Propenyl Group Signature.** Correctly identifying the propenyl group from its unique NMR fingerprint is the most important step in solving the puzzle. This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** (`C₃H₅`) and also accounts for one of the two methyl (`-CH₃`) signals.\n\n*   **Information:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n*   **Reasoning:** One `-CH₃` group has been assigned to the propenyl fragment. The second `-CH₃` must belong to the other substituent, which contains the ester. The explicit absence of `-CH₂-` signals is a key piece of negative evidence.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Power of Negative Evidence.** The \"no `-CH₂-` groups\" rule eliminates common possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). It forces the second methyl group to be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group. Either way, this fragment contributes **2 carbons**, **3 hydrogens**, and the **2 oxygens** (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n**3. Assembling and Verifying the Final Formula**\n*   **Assembly:** Sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n    *   **Fragments:** `C₆H₄` (ring) + `C₃H₅` (propenyl) + `C₂H₃O₂` (ester/methyl)\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n*   The final deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Verification:**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Confirmation with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).** This step ensures the formula is consistent with the structure. The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a DBE of `11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6`. This perfectly matches the DBE derived from the structural features: 1 aromatic ring (4), 1 C=C double bond (1), and 1 C=O double bond (1), for a total of 6. The consistency confirms the deduction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe systematic analysis of all spectroscopic data unambiguously leads to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) C12H12O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning used to determine the molecular formula. The logic is sound and follows a clear, step-by-step process of fragment analysis. Here is a synthesized analysis that incorporates the critical steps and careful points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe process involves identifying the individual building blocks of the molecule from the spectroscopic data and then summing their atomic compositions.\n\n**1. Aromatic Ring Fragment:**\n*   **Evidence:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** This identifies a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. The formula for this core fragment is **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n**2. Ester Group and Oxygen Count:**\n*   **Evidence:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Deduction:** This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** (`O₂`) in the molecular formula.\n\n**3. Substituent Identification from ¹H NMR:**\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis, where the precise structure of the two substituents is determined.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Propenyl Group from its Unique NMR Fingerprint.**\n    *   **Evidence:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific and complex splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) *and* by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in the characteristic \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** (`C₃H₅`) and also accounts for one of the two `–CH₃` signals.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using Negative Evidence to Define the Second Substituent.**\n    *   **Evidence:** There is a second `–CH₃` signal, but critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This negative evidence is extremely powerful. It eliminates common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would show a `–CH₂` signal. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Either way, this fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group, three hydrogens, and the two oxygens. The contribution is **2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens** (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Molecular Formula:**\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we arrive at the total formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl)\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n*   The final deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n*   **Careful Point 3: Confirming with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).**\n    *   DBE from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = **6**.\n    *   DBE from the structure = 1 aromatic ring (4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1) + 1 ester C=O bond (1) = **6**.\n    *   The values match, which strongly confirms the conclusion.\n\n*   **Matching with the original options:**\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers, the chemical formula can be determined through a systematic, step-by-step process. The core of the analysis involves breaking the unknown molecule into its constituent fragments, calculating their individual atomic compositions, and then summing them to find the total molecular formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Aromatic Ring Fragment (C₆H₄)**\n*   **Information:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents has had two hydrogen atoms replaced. The remaining core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. The four protons on this ring producing only two signals is consistent with a symmetric substitution pattern.\n*   **Atoms Accounted For:** 6 Carbon atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Substituent Fragments (from ¹H NMR and FTIR)**\nThe next step is to identify the two substituents attached to this aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Decoding the Propenyl Group Fingerprint**\n    *   **Information:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** This very specific splitting pattern is an unambiguous signature. A \"doublet of quartets\" arises when a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl group of three protons (giving the quartet). This unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)** as one of the substituents. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** 3 Carbon atoms, 5 Hydrogen atoms (from C₃H₅).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using Negative Evidence to Define the Second Substituent**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR shows an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR shows a second `–CH₃` signal but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The ester group accounts for the two oxygen atoms (`O₂`). One methyl group is already assigned to the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester-containing substituent. The absence of a `–CH₂` signal is a key constraint that rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** In either structural arrangement, this second fragment contributes 2 Carbon atoms (one from the carbonyl C=O, one from the -CH₃), 3 Hydrogen atoms, and the 2 Oxygen atoms (from C₂H₃O₂).\n\n**3. Assembling and Verifying the Final Formula**\n*   **Reasoning:** Sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to arrive at the total molecular formula.\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl fragment)\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n*   **Careful Point 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n    *   The deduced formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   To confirm this is a plausible structure, we check the DBE: C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    *   This matches the DBE derived from the structural features: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = 6.

This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** and accounts for one of the two methyl (`-CH₃`) signals.\n\n4.  **Second Substituent Identification (C₂H₃O₂):**\n    *   **Information:** The spectrum shows a second `-CH₃` signal, but crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.**\"\n    *   **Deduction:** The first methyl group is in the propenyl substituent. The second must be part of the ester group. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a critical piece of negative evidence that eliminates common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality (e.g., as a methyl ester, `-COOCH₃`, or an acetoxy group, `-OCOCH₃`). This fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl carbon, three hydrogens, and the two oxygens, for a total fragment formula of **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n5.  **Assembly of Final Formula:**\n    *   By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the total formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester/methyl) = **11**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester/methyl) = **12**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n    *   The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** The problem specifies a \"di-substituted\" ring and provides NMR data consistent with the four remaining protons (`C₆H₄`). This forms the base fragment.\n2.  **The Propenyl Group Fingerprint:** The most important clue is recognizing that the complex \"doublet of quartets\" signal for a vinyl proton is a definitive sign of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`), not other vinyl structures.\n3.  **The Power of Negative Evidence:** The statement \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is just as important as the signals that are present. It acts as a powerful constraint, ruling out many common structural possibilities and simplifying the identification of the second substituent.\n4.  **Systematic Summation:** The final formula is reached by methodically identifying each piece of the molecule and adding them up (`C₆H₄` + `C₃H₅` + `C₂H₃O₂`), not by guessing.\n5.  **Verification with DBE:** As a final check, the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` is 6. This perfectly matches the DBE calculated from the structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (C=C double bond) + 1 (C=O double bond) = 6, confirming the result.\n\nThe calculated formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the unanimous reasoning from all candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem is solved by systematically translating each piece of spectroscopic evidence into a molecular fragment and then summing the atoms of these fragments to determine the overall chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Identify the Aromatic Core and Oxygen Content.**\n    *   **Evidence:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR confirms the presence of 4 aromatic protons (\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"). The FTIR data shows the presence of an \"ester group.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** The aromatic ring is a C₆H₄ fragment. The ester group (-COO-) accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O₂) in the formula.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** C₆, H₄, O₂.\n\n2.  **Elucidate the First Substituent (The Propenyl Group).**\n    *   **Evidence:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction & Careful Point 1:** This complex splitting pattern is a highly specific and unambiguous spectroscopic signature. It is a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the characteristic \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\". This is the single most informative clue. This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Second Substituent.**\n    *   **Evidence:** The ¹H NMR shows a second `–CH₃` signal, and crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Deduction & Careful Point 2:** This piece of negative evidence is critical. It explicitly rules out common structural units like an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). Since one substituent is the propenyl group, the other substituent must contain the ester function and the second methyl group. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule forces the second methyl group to be directly attached to the ester, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes a carbonyl carbon, a methyl carbon, and three hydrogens.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** C₂, H₃.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula.**\n    *   **Deduction:** We sum the atoms from all the identified fragments.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** `C₆H₄`\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** `C₃H₅`\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Fragment:** `C₂H₃`\n    *   **Oxygen:** `O₂`\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n    *   The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Selection.**\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** As a final check, we can verify the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, the DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the DBE calculated from the proposed structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C double bond) + 1 (ester C=O double bond) = 6.

The remaining core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. The four protons on this ring give two distinct NMR signals, which is consistent with this structure (e.g., ortho or para substitution).\n    *   **Contribution:** This fragment contributes 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify the Oxygen Content and Ester Group (O₂)**\n    *   **Evidence:** The FTIR spectrum shows an absorption peak for an \"ester group.\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** An ester group (`-COO-`) contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Contribution:** This accounts for the 2 oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents using ¹H NMR**\n    This is the most critical stage, requiring careful interpretation of specific signal patterns.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Propenyl Group Fingerprint (C₃H₅).**\n        *   **Evidence:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** This highly specific and complex splitting pattern is an unambiguous signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.

The other vinyl proton is only coupled to its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a simple \"doublet\". This fragment also accounts for one of the two `–CH₃` signals mentioned.\n        *   **Contribution:** This substituent contributes 3 carbon atoms and 5 hydrogen atoms.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Using Negative Evidence to Define the Second Substituent (C₂H₃O₂).**\n        *   **Evidence:** The spectrum shows a second `-CH₃` signal, but critically, there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n        *   **Reasoning:** We have already assigned one `-CH₃` to the propenyl group. The second `-CH₃` must be part of the other substituent, which contains the ester functionality. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a powerful piece of negative evidence; it eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would have a `-CH₂-` signal. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester group, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n        *   **Contribution:** Both of these possibilities contribute the same number of atoms to the formula: 2 carbons (one from C=O, one from -CH₃), 3 hydrogens, and the 2 oxygens.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can calculate the complete formula.\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl):** C₂H₃O₂\n\n    **Total Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).** This step confirms the consistency of the deduction.\n    *   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**.\n    *   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\n    *   The values match perfectly, confirming the structural analysis is correct.\n\n    The derived formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` must now be matched against the options provided in the question:\n    A) C12H14O2\n    B) C11H12O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C11H14O2\n\n    The calculated formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the fifteen candidate answers reveals a complete and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning required to solve the problem.

The reasoning is unanimous across all candidate answers, which strengthens the final conclusion. A step-by-step analysis incorporating all the critical pieces of evidence is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Molecular Core and Basic Functional Groups**\n\n*   **Evidence**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and its FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction**: The core of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. This C₆H₄ fragment accounts for 4 protons. The ester group (-COO-) accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O₂).\n*   **Careful Point 1**: The base of the molecule is a `C₆H₄` fragment, which contributes **6 carbons** and **4 hydrogens**. All candidate formulas contain `O₂`, which is consistent with the ester group.\n\n**2. Elucidate the First Substituent using NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\n*   **Evidence**: The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n*   **Deduction**: This complex splitting pattern is a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) *and* by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, giving a simple \"doublet\".\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The unambiguous identification of the propenyl group from its unique NMR signal is the single most critical piece of positive evidence. This `C₃H₅` fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**, and it also accounts for one of the two `–CH₃` signals.\n\n**3. Elucidate the Second Substituent using Negative Evidence**\n\n*   **Evidence**: The NMR data shows a second `–CH₃` signal, but critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n*   **Deduction**: The first methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent. The second must be part of the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a powerful constraint that eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`).\n*   **Careful Point 3**: Using this crucial piece of \"negative evidence\" is key. This fragment contributes the carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group's carbon, and three hydrogens. Thus, the fragment's contribution is **2 carbons** and **3 hydrogens** (`C₂H₃`), plus the ester's two oxygen atoms.\n\n**4. Assemble and Verify the Final Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Summation**: By adding the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n    *   **Ring**: `C₆H₄`\n    *   **Propenyl Group**: `C₃H₅`\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Fragment**: `C₂H₃O₂`\n    *   **Total Carbons (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O)**: **2**\n*   The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   **Careful Point 4**: The result is verified using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). For `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`, the DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the DBE from the deduced structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (C=C double bond) + 1 (C=O double bond) = 6.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical analysis of all spectroscopic data consistently leads to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

The slight variations in the final letter choice are due to different randomizations of the options presented to each agent, but their deduction of the chemical formula itself is consistently C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the crucial points necessary to solve the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core (The Aromatic Ring):**\n    *   **Information:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\".\n    *   **Deduction:** This establishes a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. The formula for this core fragment is **C₆H₄**. It contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens to the total.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The two signals for the four aromatic protons are fully consistent with a di-substituted ring, providing confidence in this initial fragment assignment.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups (Ester):**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group, which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** found in all the possible formula options.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents (The Key ¹H NMR Clues):**\n    *   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific and complex splitting pattern is an unambiguous fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Decoding the NMR Fingerprint):** The \"doublet of quartets\" signal arises from the vinyl proton next to the methyl group. It is split into a doublet by its adjacent vinyl proton and then each line is further split into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group. The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a simple doublet. Identifying this `C₃H₅` fragment is the key to solving the structure. This also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n    *   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** One `-CH₃` group has been assigned to the propenyl fragment. The second `-CH₃` must be part of the ester substituent.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Power of Negative Evidence):** The absence of `-CH₂-` signals is a powerful constraint. It explicitly rules out common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). This forces the conclusion that the second methyl group is directly attached to the ester, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group. This fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and the 2 oxygens (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we determine the complete formula:\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** `C₆H₄`\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** `C₃H₅`\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl):** `C₂H₃O₂`\n\n    **Total Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\n    The logically deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   **Careful Point 4 (Consistency Check):** The result can be confirmed with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the structural elements: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = 6.\n    *   **Matching with Options:** The derived formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` must be matched against the specific options provided in the question:\n        A) C11H12O2\n        B) C11H14O2\n        C) C12H12O2\n        D) C12H14O2\n\n    The correct formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough review of the candidate answers, there is a strong and unanimous consensus on the logical deduction of the chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data. The variations in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are merely artifacts of the options being presented in a different order to each agent; their core chemical reasoning is identical and sound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis that synthesizes their collective reasoning and highlights the critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying the Molecular Core and Oxygen Content**\n\n*   **Evidence**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the FTIR shows an \"ester group\".\n*   **Deduction**: This establishes a C₆H₄ aromatic core and confirms the presence of two oxygen atoms (O₂). The ¹H NMR confirms the four hydrogens on the aromatic ring (\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\").\n*   **Contribution**: `C₆H₄` and `O₂`.\n\n**2. Decoding the Substituents with ¹H NMR**\n\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis, requiring the interpretation of specific signal patterns and the application of negative evidence.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group Fingerprint.**\n    *   **Evidence**: \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction**: This highly specific and complex splitting pattern is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the unmistakable \"doublet of quartets\" signal. The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a simple \"doublet\". This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Contribution**: `C₃H₅`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Power of Negative Evidence.**\n    *   **Evidence**: The spectrum shows a second signal for a `–CH₃` group, but critically, there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Deduction**: This is a powerful constraint. It eliminates common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would possess a `–CH₂` signal. Since one methyl group has been assigned to the propenyl fragment, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a structure like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`).\n    *   **Contribution**: This fragment contributes the atoms of the ester's carbonyl group and the second methyl group, which is `C₂H₃`.\n\n**3. Assembling and Calculating the Final Formula**\n\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can calculate the complete molecular formula:\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group**: C₃H₅\n*   **Ester/Methyl Fragment**: C₂H₃\n*   **Oxygen Atoms**: O₂\n*   **Total Carbons (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O)**: **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Confirming Consistency.** This final check validates the analysis.\n*   **From Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**.\n*   **From Deduced Structure**: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\n*   The perfect match confirms the deduction is correct and self-consistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical analysis unambiguously leads to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

Aromatic Core and Oxygen Content Identification (C₆H₄O₂)**\n*   **Information**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\" The FTIR confirms an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Deduction**: This establishes a benzene ring core where two hydrogens have been replaced, leaving a `C₆H₄` fragment. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens. The ester group (`-COO-`) accounts for the 2 oxygen atoms (`O₂`).\n\n**2. First Substituent Identification (Propenyl Group, C₃H₅)**\n*   **Information**: The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n*   **Deduction**: This specific signal pattern is a definitive fingerprint for a substituent group.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Interpreting the Splitting Pattern.** The \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) signal arises when a vinyl proton is coupled to one other vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and three protons of an adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet). This unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)** as one of the substituents. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`C₃H₅`) and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n**3. Second Substituent Identification (Methyl Group, CH₃)**\n*   **Information**: The ¹H NMR shows a second `-CH₃` signal but, crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n*   **Deduction**: We have already assigned one `-CH₃` to the propenyl group. The second `-CH₃` must be part of the ester functionality.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Importance of Negative Evidence.** The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a critical piece of evidence. It eliminates the possibility of common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). This means the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester, forming a structure such as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`). This fragment contributes 1 carbon (the methyl C) and 3 hydrogens (`CH₃`). Note that the ester's carbonyl carbon was implicitly part of the functional group and now is explicitly accounted for alongside this methyl group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Molecular Formula**\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can calculate the complete formula:\n*   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** C₆H₄\n*   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** C₃H₅\n*   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl):** The ester (`-COO-`) contributes C and 2O.

Identifying the Core Aromatic Fragment (C₆H₄)**\n*   **Information**: The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is confirmed by the ¹H NMR spectrum, which shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\".\n*   **Deduction**: A standard benzene ring is C₆H₆. When it is di-substituted, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups. This leaves a core fragment with the chemical formula **C₆H₄**. The four remaining protons account for the two signals observed in the NMR.\n*   **Atoms Accounted For**: 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens.\n\n**2. Identifying the Oxygen-Containing Functional Group (Ester, O₂)**\n*   **Information**: The FTIR spectrum clearly indicates the presence of an **ester group**.\n*   **Deduction**: An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R'. This immediately accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** present in all the candidate formulas.\n*   **Atoms Accounted For**: 2 oxygens.\n\n**3.

The vinyl proton attached to the same carbon as the methyl group is split by its single vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, so it appears as a simple \"doublet\". This substituent also accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` groups mentioned.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For**: 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The second substituent is identified by integrating the remaining NMR data, including the critical \"negative evidence\".**\n    *   **Information**: The spectrum shows a second, distinct `-CH₃` signal, but explicitly states there are \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction**: We have already assigned one substituent as a propenyl group. The second substituent must therefore contain the ester and the second methyl group. The absence of a `-CH₂-` signal is a powerful constraint. It rules out common ester formations like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). This forces the second methyl group to be directly bonded to the ester functionality.

The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by both its single vinyl neighbor (the doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (the quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\".\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Propenyl Group Signature.** Correctly identifying the propenyl group from its unique NMR fingerprint is the most important step in solving the puzzle. This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** (`C₃H₅`) and also accounts for one of the two methyl (`-CH₃`) signals.\n\n*   **Information:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n*   **Reasoning:** One `-CH₃` group has been assigned to the propenyl fragment. The second `-CH₃` must belong to the other substituent, which contains the ester. The explicit absence of `-CH₂-` signals is a key piece of negative evidence.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Power of Negative Evidence.** The \"no `-CH₂-` groups\" rule eliminates common possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). It forces the second methyl group to be directly attached to the ester functionality, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group. Either way, this fragment contributes **2 carbons**, **3 hydrogens**, and the **2 oxygens** (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n**3. Assembling and Verifying the Final Formula**\n*   **Assembly:** Sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n    *   **Fragments:** `C₆H₄` (ring) + `C₃H₅` (propenyl) + `C₂H₃O₂` (ester/methyl)\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n*   The final deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Verification:**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Confirmation with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).** This step ensures the formula is consistent with the structure. The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a DBE of `11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6`. This perfectly matches the DBE derived from the structural features: 1 aromatic ring (4), 1 C=C double bond (1), and 1 C=O double bond (1), for a total of 6. The consistency confirms the deduction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe systematic analysis of all spectroscopic data unambiguously leads to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

The logic is sound and follows a clear, step-by-step process of fragment analysis. Here is a synthesized analysis that incorporates the critical steps and careful points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe process involves identifying the individual building blocks of the molecule from the spectroscopic data and then summing their atomic compositions.\n\n**1. Aromatic Ring Fragment:**\n*   **Evidence:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** This identifies a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. The formula for this core fragment is **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n**2. Ester Group and Oxygen Count:**\n*   **Evidence:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an \"ester group.\"\n*   **Deduction:** This accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** (`O₂`) in the molecular formula.\n\n**3. Substituent Identification from ¹H NMR:**\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis, where the precise structure of the two substituents is determined.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Propenyl Group from its Unique NMR Fingerprint.**\n    *   **Evidence:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific and complex splitting pattern is a definitive signature for a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) *and* by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in the characteristic \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\". This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** (`C₃H₅`) and also accounts for one of the two `–CH₃` signals.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using Negative Evidence to Define the Second Substituent.**\n    *   **Evidence:** There is a second `–CH₃` signal, but critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This negative evidence is extremely powerful. It eliminates common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would show a `–CH₂` signal. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). Either way, this fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group, three hydrogens, and the two oxygens. The contribution is **2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens** (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Molecular Formula:**\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we arrive at the total formula:\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl)\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n*   The final deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n*   **Careful Point 3: Confirming with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).**\n    *   DBE from the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = **6**.\n    *   DBE from the structure = 1 aromatic ring (4) + 1 vinyl C=C bond (1) + 1 ester C=O bond (1) = **6**.\n    *   The values match, which strongly confirms the conclusion.\n\n*   **Matching with the original options:**\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers, the chemical formula can be determined through a systematic, step-by-step process. The core of the analysis involves breaking the unknown molecule into its constituent fragments, calculating their individual atomic compositions, and then summing them to find the total molecular formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Aromatic Ring Fragment (C₆H₄)**\n*   **Information:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents has had two hydrogen atoms replaced. The remaining core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. The four protons on this ring producing only two signals is consistent with a symmetric substitution pattern.\n*   **Atoms Accounted For:** 6 Carbon atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Substituent Fragments (from ¹H NMR and FTIR)**\nThe next step is to identify the two substituents attached to this aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Decoding the Propenyl Group Fingerprint**\n    *   **Information:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** This very specific splitting pattern is an unambiguous signature. A \"doublet of quartets\" arises when a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl group of three protons (giving the quartet). This unequivocally identifies a **propenyl group (`–CH=CH–CH₃`)** as one of the substituents. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** 3 Carbon atoms, 5 Hydrogen atoms (from C₃H₅).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using Negative Evidence to Define the Second Substituent**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR shows an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR shows a second `–CH₃` signal but, crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The ester group accounts for the two oxygen atoms (`O₂`). One methyl group is already assigned to the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester-containing substituent. The absence of a `–CH₂` signal is a key constraint that rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`).\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** In either structural arrangement, this second fragment contributes 2 Carbon atoms (one from the carbonyl C=O, one from the -CH₃), 3 Hydrogen atoms, and the 2 Oxygen atoms (from C₂H₃O₂).\n\n**3. Assembling and Verifying the Final Formula**\n*   **Reasoning:** Sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to arrive at the total molecular formula.\n    *   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (aromatic ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl group) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester/methyl fragment)\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n*   **Careful Point 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n    *   The deduced formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   To confirm this is a plausible structure, we check the DBE: C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    *   This matches the DBE derived from the structural features: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = 6. The perfect match confirms the result.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe analysis consistently and unambiguously points to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H14O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided information and the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers, the chemical formula can be determined through a clear, step-by-step process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to translate each piece of spectroscopic data into a corresponding structural fragment and then sum their atomic compositions.\n\n1.  **Aromatic Core Identification (C₆H₄):**\n    *   **Information:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" with \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" in the ¹H NMR.\n    *   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (C₆H₆) with two substituents becomes a **C₆H₄** fragment. This accounts for **6 carbons** and **4 hydrogens**.\n\n2.  **Oxygen Content Identification (O₂):**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an **ester group** (-COO-).\n    *   **Deduction:** This immediately accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n\n3.  **First Substituent Identification (C₃H₅):**\n    *   **Information:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific splitting pattern is an unambiguous fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. This fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens** and accounts for one of the two methyl (`-CH₃`) signals.\n\n4.  **Second Substituent Identification (C₂H₃O₂):**\n    *   **Information:** The spectrum shows a second `-CH₃` signal, but crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.**\"\n    *   **Deduction:** The first methyl group is in the propenyl substituent. The second must be part of the ester group. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a critical piece of negative evidence that eliminates common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality (e.g., as a methyl ester, `-COOCH₃`, or an acetoxy group, `-OCOCH₃`). This fragment contributes the ester's carbonyl carbon, the second methyl carbon, three hydrogens, and the two oxygens, for a total fragment formula of **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n5.  **Assembly of Final Formula:**\n    *   By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can determine the total formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester/methyl) = **11**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester/methyl) = **12**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n    *   The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region:** The problem specifies a \"di-substituted\" ring and provides NMR data consistent with the four remaining protons (`C₆H₄`). This forms the base fragment.\n2.  **The Propenyl Group Fingerprint:** The most important clue is recognizing that the complex \"doublet of quartets\" signal for a vinyl proton is a definitive sign of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`), not other vinyl structures.\n3.  **The Power of Negative Evidence:** The statement \"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\" is just as important as the signals that are present. It acts as a powerful constraint, ruling out many common structural possibilities and simplifying the identification of the second substituent.\n4.  **Systematic Summation:** The final formula is reached by methodically identifying each piece of the molecule and adding them up (`C₆H₄` + `C₃H₅` + `C₂H₃O₂`), not by guessing.\n5.  **Verification with DBE:** As a final check, the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` is 6. This perfectly matches the DBE calculated from the structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (C=C double bond) + 1 (C=O double bond) = 6, confirming the result.\n\nThe calculated formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the unanimous reasoning from all candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem is solved by systematically translating each piece of spectroscopic evidence into a molecular fragment and then summing the atoms of these fragments to determine the overall chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Identify the Aromatic Core and Oxygen Content.**\n    *   **Evidence:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" The ¹H NMR confirms the presence of 4 aromatic protons (\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"). The FTIR data shows the presence of an \"ester group.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** The aromatic ring is a C₆H₄ fragment. The ester group (-COO-) accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O₂) in the formula.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** C₆, H₄, O₂.\n\n2.  **Elucidate the First Substituent (The Propenyl Group).**\n    *   **Evidence:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction & Careful Point 1:** This complex splitting pattern is a highly specific and unambiguous spectroscopic signature. It is a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the characteristic \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\". This is the single most informative clue. This fragment contributes **C₃H₅** and also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Second Substituent.**\n    *   **Evidence:** The ¹H NMR shows a second `–CH₃` signal, and crucially, **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Deduction & Careful Point 2:** This piece of negative evidence is critical. It explicitly rules out common structural units like an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). Since one substituent is the propenyl group, the other substituent must contain the ester function and the second methyl group. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule forces the second methyl group to be directly attached to the ester, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, this fragment contributes a carbonyl carbon, a methyl carbon, and three hydrogens.\n    *   **Atoms Accounted For:** C₂, H₃.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula.**\n    *   **Deduction:** We sum the atoms from all the identified fragments.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** `C₆H₄`\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** `C₃H₅`\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Fragment:** `C₂H₃`\n    *   **Oxygen:** `O₂`\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** **2**\n    *   The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Selection.**\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** As a final check, we can verify the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, the DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the DBE calculated from the proposed structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (vinyl C=C double bond) + 1 (ester C=O double bond) = 6.

Aromatic Ring Fragment Identification**\n*   **Information**: The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\".\n*   **Deduction**: This confirms the presence of a benzene ring core where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The remaining core fragment has the formula **C₆H₄**. The four protons on this ring are accounted for by the two NMR signals.\n*   **Contribution**: 6 Carbon atoms and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Ester Group and Oxygen Count**\n*   **Information**: The FTIR spectrum shows an absorption peak confirming the presence of an \"ester group\".\n*   **Deduction**: This accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms** in the final formula (`O₂`). It also indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), which contributes one degree of unsaturation.\n\n**3. Substituent Identification from ¹H NMR Data**\nThis is the most critical stage, relying on the interpretation of specific signals and constraints.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group Fingerprint**\n    *   **Information**: The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction**: This is a classic and unambiguous splitting pattern that definitively identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\" signal. The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet\". This fragment also accounts for one of the two `–CH₃` signals mentioned.\n    *   **Contribution**: 3 Carbon atoms and 5 Hydrogen atoms (`C₃H₅`).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Power of Negative Evidence (No -CH₂- Groups)**\n    *   **Information**: The spectrum shows a second `–CH₃` signal, but critically, there are \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**\".\n    *   **Deduction**: Having accounted for one `–CH₃` in the propenyl group, the second `–CH₃` must be part of the other substituent, which contains the ester functionality. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a crucial constraint that eliminates common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would possess a `-CH₂-` signal. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`).\n    *   **Contribution**: This ester-containing fragment contributes the carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group, and the two oxygens, for a total of **2 Carbon atoms, 3 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms (`C₂H₃O₂`)**.\n\n**4. Assembling the Final Molecular Formula**\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we arrive at the complete formula:\n*   **Fragments**: `C₆H₄` (aromatic ring) + `C₃H₅` (propenyl group) + `C₂H₃O₂` (ester/methyl part)\n*   **Carbon (C) Sum**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) Sum**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O) Sum**: **2**\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**5. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Consistency Check**\n    *   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**.\n    *   **DBE from Structure**: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\n*   The perfect match confirms the analysis is sound and all data points are consistent with the derived formula.\n\nMatching this derived formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, with the options provided in the original question:\nA) C11H12O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H14O2\nD) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a synthesis of the consistent reasoning from the candidate answers, the chemical formula can be determined through a systematic, step-by-step process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to translate the spectroscopic data into structural fragments and then sum their atomic compositions to arrive at the final molecular formula.\n\n**1. Identifying the Aromatic Core Fragment (C₆H₄)**\n\n*   **Evidence:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction:** A benzene ring (which starts as C₆H₆) with two substituents has had two hydrogens removed, leaving a core fragment of **C₆H₄**. The four remaining protons on this ring giving only two signals is consistent with this di-substituted structure (e.g., a para or ortho arrangement).\n*   **Contribution:** This fragment contributes 6 Carbon atoms and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Identifying the Substituent Fragments from FTIR and ¹H NMR**\n\nThis step requires careful interpretation of specific signals and, just as importantly, the absence of others.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group (C₃H₅).**\n    *   **Evidence:** The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific and complex splitting pattern is a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton next to the methyl group is split by its other vinyl neighbor (creating a doublet) *and* by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets.\" The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, creating a simple \"doublet.\" This fragment accounts for one of the two `-CH₃` signals mentioned.\n    *   **Contribution:** This fragment adds 3 Carbon atoms and 5 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Ester/Methyl Fragment (C₂H₃O₂) and the Power of Negative Evidence.**\n    *   **Evidence:** The FTIR confirms an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR confirms a second `–CH₃` group but explicitly states there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Deduction:** The ester group accounts for the **2 Oxygen atoms**. One `-CH₃` group is in the propenyl fragment, so the second `-CH₃` must be part of the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out common possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would contain a `-CH₂-` group. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a fragment such as a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH₃`). In either case, the fragment contributes one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, and the two oxygens.\n    *   **Contribution:** This fragment adds 2 Carbon atoms, 3 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n\n**3. Assembling and Verifying the Molecular Formula**\n\nBy summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we can calculate the total molecular formula.\n\n*   **Fragments:** C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (ester)\n*   **Total Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** **2**\n\nThe deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).** This final check confirms the consistency of the conclusion.\n    *   **DBE from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   **DBE from Structure:** 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 ester C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6**.\n    The perfect match validates the entire analysis.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula derived from a thorough and logical interpretation of all spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Comparing this to the original question's options:\n\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is a task that requires deducing a molecular formula from a set of spectroscopic data. The reasoning is unanimous across all candidate answers, which strengthens the final conclusion. A step-by-step analysis incorporating all the critical pieces of evidence is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Molecular Core and Basic Functional Groups**\n\n*   **Evidence**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" and its FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group.\" The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\"\n*   **Deduction**: The core of the molecule is a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. This C₆H₄ fragment accounts for 4 protons. The ester group (-COO-) accounts for the two oxygen atoms (O₂).\n*   **Careful Point 1**: The base of the molecule is a `C₆H₄` fragment, which contributes **6 carbons** and **4 hydrogens**. All candidate formulas contain `O₂`, which is consistent with the ester group.\n\n**2. Elucidate the First Substituent using NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\n*   **Evidence**: The ¹H NMR shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\"\n*   **Deduction**: This complex splitting pattern is a definitive fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) *and* by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, giving a simple \"doublet\".\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The unambiguous identification of the propenyl group from its unique NMR signal is the single most critical piece of positive evidence. This `C₃H₅` fragment contributes **3 carbons** and **5 hydrogens**, and it also accounts for one of the two `–CH₃` signals.\n\n**3. Elucidate the Second Substituent using Negative Evidence**\n\n*   **Evidence**: The NMR data shows a second `–CH₃` signal, but critically, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n*   **Deduction**: The first methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent. The second must be part of the ester substituent. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule is a powerful constraint that eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`).\n*   **Careful Point 3**: Using this crucial piece of \"negative evidence\" is key. This fragment contributes the carbonyl carbon, the second methyl group's carbon, and three hydrogens. Thus, the fragment's contribution is **2 carbons** and **3 hydrogens** (`C₂H₃`), plus the ester's two oxygen atoms.\n\n**4. Assemble and Verify the Final Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Summation**: By adding the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n    *   **Ring**: `C₆H₄`\n    *   **Propenyl Group**: `C₃H₅`\n    *   **Ester/Methyl Fragment**: `C₂H₃O₂`\n    *   **Total Carbons (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O)**: **2**\n*   The deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n*   **Careful Point 4**: The result is verified using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). For `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`, the DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the DBE from the deduced structure: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (C=C double bond) + 1 (C=O double bond) = 6.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical analysis of all spectroscopic data consistently leads to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C11H14O2\nC) C12H12O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a complete analysis of the provided answers and the original question, a single correct answer can be determined. The reasoning across all candidate answers is unanimously correct and follows the same logical pathway. The slight variations in the final letter choice are due to different randomizations of the options presented to each agent, but their deduction of the chemical formula itself is consistently C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the crucial points necessary to solve the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core (The Aromatic Ring):**\n    *   **Information:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the ¹H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\".\n    *   **Deduction:** This establishes a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced. The formula for this core fragment is **C₆H₄**. It contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens to the total.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The two signals for the four aromatic protons are fully consistent with a di-substituted ring, providing confidence in this initial fragment assignment.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups (Ester):**\n    *   **Information:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group, which accounts for the **2 oxygen atoms** found in all the possible formula options.\n\n3.  **Elucidate the Substituents (The Key ¹H NMR Clues):**\n    *   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction:** This highly specific and complex splitting pattern is an unambiguous fingerprint for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Decoding the NMR Fingerprint):** The \"doublet of quartets\" signal arises from the vinyl proton next to the methyl group. It is split into a doublet by its adjacent vinyl proton and then each line is further split into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group. The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a simple doublet. Identifying this `C₃H₅` fragment is the key to solving the structure. This also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n\n    *   **Information:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\" and, crucially, \"**no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups**.\"\n    *   **Deduction:** One `-CH₃` group has been assigned to the propenyl fragment. The second `-CH₃` must be part of the ester substituent.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (The Power of Negative Evidence):** The absence of `-CH₂-` signals is a powerful constraint. It explicitly rules out common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). This forces the conclusion that the second methyl group is directly attached to the ester, as in a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or acetoxy (`-OCOCH₃`) group. This fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and the 2 oxygens (`C₂H₃O₂`).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Molecular Formula:**\n    By summing the atoms from all the identified fragments, we determine the complete formula:\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Ring):** `C₆H₄`\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl):** `C₃H₅`\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Ester/Methyl):** `C₂H₃O₂`\n\n    **Total Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\n    The logically deduced molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verification and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   **Careful Point 4 (Consistency Check):** The result can be confirmed with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This perfectly matches the structural elements: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBEs) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = 6.\n    *   **Matching with Options:** The derived formula `C₁₁H₁₂O₂` must be matched against the specific options provided in the question:\n        A) C11H12O2\n        B) C11H14O2\n        C) C12H12O2\n        D) C12H14O2\n\n    The correct formula, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough review of the candidate answers, there is a strong and unanimous consensus on the logical deduction of the chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data. The variations in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are merely artifacts of the options being presented in a different order to each agent; their core chemical reasoning is identical and sound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis that synthesizes their collective reasoning and highlights the critical points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying the Molecular Core and Oxygen Content**\n\n*   **Evidence**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" and the FTIR shows an \"ester group\".\n*   **Deduction**: This establishes a C₆H₄ aromatic core and confirms the presence of two oxygen atoms (O₂). The ¹H NMR confirms the four hydrogens on the aromatic ring (\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\").\n*   **Contribution**: `C₆H₄` and `O₂`.\n\n**2. Decoding the Substituents with ¹H NMR**\n\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis, requiring the interpretation of specific signal patterns and the application of negative evidence.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Propenyl Group Fingerprint.**\n    *   **Evidence**: \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n    *   **Deduction**: This highly specific and complex splitting pattern is a definitive signature of a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in the unmistakable \"doublet of quartets\" signal. The other vinyl proton is only split by its neighbor, appearing as a simple \"doublet\". This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl group signals.\n    *   **Contribution**: `C₃H₅`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Power of Negative Evidence.**\n    *   **Evidence**: The spectrum shows a second signal for a `–CH₃` group, but critically, there are **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups.\"**\n    *   **Deduction**: This is a powerful constraint. It eliminates common structures like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`), which would possess a `–CH₂` signal. Since one methyl group has been assigned to the propenyl fragment, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, forming a structure like a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH₃`).\n    *   **Contribution**: This fragment contributes the atoms of the ester's carbonyl group and the second methyl group, which is `C₂H₃`.\n\n**3.
