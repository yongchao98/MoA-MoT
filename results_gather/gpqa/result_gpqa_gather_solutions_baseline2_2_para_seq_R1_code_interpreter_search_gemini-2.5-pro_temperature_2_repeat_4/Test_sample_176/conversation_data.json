Derivation of the Correct Formula**\n\n*   **Luminosity:** The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Squaring this gives $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. So, the formula becomes:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature is related to the intrinsic peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) by Wien's Law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$). This means $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler effect. For Star 2 moving away from us at $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted.\n    $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c})$.\n    For Star 1 with $v_1 = 0$, its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n*   **Combining Wavelengths:** The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    Therefore, $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c})$.\n*   **Solving for Temperature Ratio:** We can rearrange the above to find the ratio needed for the temperature:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    Since $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$, we have:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   **Final Formula:** Substituting the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4$.\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\n*   We need to calculate the value using $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s.\n*   $\\frac{v_2}{c} = \\frac{700}{300000} \\approx 0.002333$.\n*   $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 0.002333}\\right)^4 \\approx 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.002333}\\right)^4$.\n*   $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times (0.99767)^4 \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.9907$.\n*   $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.2291$.\n\n**3. Conclusion and Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\n*   The calculated value is approximately **2.229**. When rounded to two decimal places, this is **2.23**.\n*   Looking at the options:\n    A) ~2.25\n    B) ~2.23\n    C) ~2.32\n    D) ~2.35\n*   The calculated value matches option B.\n*   The majority of the candidate answers correctly perform this derivation and calculation. However, many of them make a mistake when matching their calculated value (which is consistently ~2.229) to the lettered options provided in the original question prompt. For instance, some calculate 2.229 but select option D.\n*   Ignoring the inconsistent final choices of the candidates and relying on the correct physical derivation and calculation, the answer is unequivocally ~2.23. The information regarding the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this black-body radiation problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Objective**: Calculate the ratio of luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n*   **Given Information**:\n    *   $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$ (Radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2).\n    *   The stars radiate as black bodies.\n    *   The *observed* peak wavelengths are identical ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n    *   The radial velocity of Star 1 is $v_1 = 0$ km/s.\n    *   The radial velocity of Star 2 is $v_2 = 700$ km/s.\n    *   Information about mass ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Physical Laws**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: For a black body, luminosity ($L$) is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature ($T$). As stars are spheres (Area = $4\\pi R^2$), the formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The temperature of a black body ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), i.e., $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the object's radial velocity ($v$). The relationship is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**:\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n2.  **Substitute the Radius Ratio**:\n    We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**:\n    This is the most critical step. From Wien's Law, we know the temperature ratio is related to the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$. We must find this ratio.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   For Star 1, with $v_1 = 0$, there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, the light is Doppler-shifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions for them equal to each other:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**:\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c})^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$\n\n5.  **Numerical Evaluation**:\n    *   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $\\frac{v_2}{c} \\approx \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.002333$\n    *   $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.229$\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 2.229. When rounded to two decimal places, this is 2.23. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) ~2.23\n*   B) ~2.32\n*   C) ~2.25\n*   D) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.

However, the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is altered by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect. Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, we must use the Doppler shift to relate their intrinsic wavelengths, and therefore their temperatures.\n\n2.  **Derivation of the Formula:**\n    *   The ratio of luminosities is: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n    *   We are given $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$, so $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = 2.25$.\n    *   We know $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   For Star 1, with zero radial velocity, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, with velocity $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$, its emitted light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is given by $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$), we have $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   This gives us the ratio for their rest wavelengths: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the luminosity ratio formula, we get the final equation:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$.\n\n3.  **Calculation and Evaluation:**\n    *   Virtually all agents that performed the calculation (Agents 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) correctly followed this logic or a very similar relativistic logic (which gives a nearly identical result).\n    *   The Python code provided by multiple agents consistently calculates the result of this formula. For instance, the code `(1.5**2) / ((1 + 700000 / 299792458)**4)` yields approximately `2.2291`.\n    *   This numerical result, when rounded to two decimal places, is `2.23`.\n\n4.  **Matching to Options and Conclusion:**\n    *   The question provides the options: A) ~2.23, B) ~2.35, C) ~2.32, D) ~2.25.\n    *   The calculated value of `2.23` corresponds to option A.\n    *   There is a clear consensus among the agents on the reasoning and the numerical result. Although many agents selected an incorrect letter (B, C, or D) due to confusion or error, their underlying calculation strongly supports the value 2.23.

Foundational Principles**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is proportional to its surface area ($4\\pi R^2$) and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T$). The formula is:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), i.e., the wavelength at which it emits the most light in its own reference frame. The relation is:\n    $T \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{rest}}$\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The wavelength of light we observe from a star ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) if the star is moving towards or away from us. For a star moving with a radial velocity $v_r$, the observed wavelength is given by:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light. A positive $v_r$ indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio.**\n    We want to find the ratio $L_1 / L_2$. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the Radius Ratio.**\n    The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so the radius ratio $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$).**\n    From Wien's Law, we know the temperature ratio is the inverse of the intrinsic wavelength ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest, 2}}{\\lambda_{rest, 1}}$\n\n    We must find this wavelength ratio using the given fact that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, 2}$).\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs, 1} = \\lambda_{rest, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is Doppler shifted: $\\lambda_{obs, 2} = \\lambda_{rest, 2} (1 + \\frac{v_2}{c})$.\n\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, 2}$, we can set their expressions equal:\n    $\\lambda_{rest, 1} = \\lambda_{rest, 2} (1 + \\frac{v_2}{c})$\n\n    Rearranging to find the wavelength ratio needed for our temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest, 2}}{\\lambda_{rest, 1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_2}{c}}$\n\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_2}{c}}$\n\n*   **Step 4: Complete the Calculation.**\n    Now substitute the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_2}{c}}\\right)^4$\n\n    Let's plug in the numerical values:\n    *   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   The ratio $\\frac{v_2}{c} \\approx \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{2.998 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.002335$\n\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 0.002335}\\right)^4 \\approx 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.002335}\\right)^4 \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.229$\n\n**3.

The value ~2.229 points unambiguously to the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compute the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n### **2. Deconstruct the Physics**\n*   **Luminosity:** The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that a star's luminosity ($L$) is proportional to its surface area ($4\\pi R^2$) and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T^4$). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Luminosity Ratio:** Based on the formula above, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n*   **Wien's Law:** A star's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$. This means the temperature ratio is the inverse of the rest-frame wavelength ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}} $$\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's motion. For speeds much less than light, this is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$, where $v$ is the radial velocity.\n\n### **3. Apply the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We know the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$).\n    *   For Star 1, the velocity $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, the velocity $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is Doppler-shifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$, we can write: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   We need the ratio $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$ for the temperature calculation. Rearranging the equation gives:\n        $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n\n### **4. Synthesize and Calculate**\nNow, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $$\n\nAt this point, we can reason logically without a calculator:\n*   The term $(1 + v_2/c)$ is a number slightly greater than 1.\n*   Raising this to the fourth power results in a number that is still slightly greater than 1.\n*   Dividing 2.25 by a number slightly greater than 1 will result in a value slightly *less* than 2.25.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) ~2.32 (Greater than 2.25)\nB) ~2.35 (Greater than 2.25)\nC) ~2.25 (This would be the answer if the Doppler effect was ignored)\nD) ~2.23 (The only option slightly less than 2.25)\n\nThe logical deduction points directly to **D**.\n\nFor completeness, the numerical calculation is:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700 \\text{ km/s}}{300,000 \\text{ km/s}}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\nThis value, rounded to two decimal places, is **2.23**.\n\n### **5. Final Decision**\nThe thorough analysis of the physics and the numerical calculation both confirm the same result. The vast majority of candidate answers that show their work arrive at the value of ~2.229. Any discrepancies in their final letter choice are due to differing option lists or simple mistakes. Based on the options provided in the question, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\nThe main goal is to compute the luminosity ratio, L₁/L₂, between two stars. To do this, we need to analyze the provided physical parameters.\n\n**2. Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star acting as a black body is given by  L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength (λ_rest), i.e., T ∝ 1/λ_rest.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a star is shifted based on its radial velocity (v_r). For speeds much less than the speed of light (v_r << c), this is given by the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v_r/c).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Use the Radius Information:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so the radius ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.

Understand the Fundamental Principles**\n\nThe solution to this problem relies on two key principles of physics regarding black body radiation:\n\n*   **The Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T). The total luminosity (L), which is the total power radiated, is therefore given by $L = A \\sigma T^4$, where A is the surface area and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. For a spherical star of radius R, the area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, so the formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emit}$).\n*   **The Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{obs}$) from a moving source is shifted relative to its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$). For a source moving with radial velocity $v_r$, the non-relativistic approximation is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$). Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n\nThe constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n**3. Substitute Known Ratios and Derive Unknowns**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the ratio $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$. Substituting this into our equation gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This requires more steps.\n    1.  From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* peak wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{emit,2}}{\\lambda_{emit,1}}$.\n    2.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    3.  We relate the observed and emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect for each star.\n        *   For Star 1: $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n        *   For Star 2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is Doppler-shifted. $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set their expressions equal: $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  Rearranging to get the ratio we need for the temperature: $\\frac{\\lambda_{emit,2}}{\\lambda_{emit,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    6.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, substitute the temperature ratio back into the main luminosity equation:\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$ (Speed of light)\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700,000}{299,792,458}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.00233496)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291$\n\n**5.

For non-relativistic speeds (where v << c), the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest(1 + v/c). A positive velocity indicates the source is moving away.\n\n### **3.

Calculate the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the ratio (R₁ / R₂) = 1.5. Squaring this gives (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:**\n    1.  From Wien's Law (T ∝ 1/λ_rest), the temperature ratio is the inverse of the rest-frame peak wavelength ratio: **T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁**.\n    2.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    3.  For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is equal to its rest wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    4.  For Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is Doppler shifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    5.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    6.  Rearranging to find the wavelength ratio needed for the temperature calculation: **λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n    7.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n### **5.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n**2. Core Physics Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is a constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), i.e., $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius ratio $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\nPlugging this in:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\nThis means the final answer will be close to, but slightly different from, 2.25. The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is related to the *intrinsic* wavelengths: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n*   We need to relate the intrinsic wavelengths to the observed wavelengths using the Doppler effect. The problem states the *observed* wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n*   For Star 1, the radial velocity $v_1 = 0$, so its observed wavelength equals its intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n*   For Star 2, the radial velocity $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Now we can find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**6.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify the Core Physics Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. The total luminosity ($L$) of a spherical star with radius $R$ and surface temperature $T$ is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which its emitted radiation is at a maximum ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max}}$). This is expressed as $T = b/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max}}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The wavelength of light we observe ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its originally emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) if the source is moving relative to us. For non-relativistic speeds, this shift is given by $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for moving away) and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel, leaving:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Substitute Known Values**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius ratio is $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$. Squaring this gives $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not needed for this calculation based on black body radiation laws and can be ignored.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem and requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is inversely related to the ratio of the *rest-frame* (emitted) peak wavelengths: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}}}$.\n*   We need to find the rest-frame wavelengths using the fact that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}}$).\n*   For Star_1, its radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$. Thus, there is no Doppler shift, and its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}}$.\n*   For Star_2, its radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is Doppler redshifted (since it's moving away): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions for them equal to each other:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Now, we rearrange this to get the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Result**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from step 4:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$ (Using a precise value doesn't significantly change the result for this problem)\n*   $\\frac{v_2}{c} \\approx \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.002333$\n\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 0.002333}\\right)^4 \\approx 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.002333}\\right)^4 \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $\n\n**7.

Deconstruction of the Problem**\nThe main goal is to compute the ratio of luminosities, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars given their physical properties.\n\n*   **Star Properties:**\n    *   $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$ (Radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2)\n    *   $v_1 = 0$ km/s (Radial velocity of Star 1 is zero)\n    *   $v_2 = 700$ km/s (Radial velocity of Star 2)\n*   **Key Observations:**\n    *   The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.\n    *   Their *observed* wavelengths of peak brightness are identical ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to the luminosity calculation for black bodies and can be ignored.\n\n### **2. Core Physics Principles**\nThe solution requires applying three fundamental physical laws:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This links luminosity to radius ($R$) and temperature ($T$).\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), meaning $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$. This connects temperature to the light emitted by the star in its own reference frame.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the *intrinsic* wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the star's motion. For a star moving away from us, the non-relativistic approximation is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\nThis derivation synthesizes the correct reasoning demonstrated by the majority of the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the Radius Ratio.**\n    Given that $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, we square this value: $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    This step shows that if the temperatures were equal, the answer would be 2.25. The temperature difference will modify this value.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the crucial step that involves Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We use the fact that the *observed* wavelengths are equal ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n    *   For Star 1, with $v_1 = 0$, there's no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Calculation.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $$\n    Now, plug in the values: $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$ and $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$.\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\n1.  **Logical Check:** As shown in Step 2, without a Doppler effect, the ratio would be 2.25. The Doppler effect for the receding Star 2 means it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$) to appear the same temperature as Star 1. A lower temperature for Star 1 ($T_1$) means the term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1, so the final luminosity ratio must be slightly *less than* 2.25. Reviewing the options:\n    *   A) ~2.25 (Incorrect; ignores Doppler effect)\n    *   B) ~2.32 (Incorrect; must be < 2.25)\n    *   C) ~2.23 (Correct; is slightly < 2.25)\n    *   D) ~2.35 (Incorrect; must be < 2.25)\n\n2.  **Numerical Calculation:** The calculation yields ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**.\n\n3.  **Candidate Consensus:** A vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly perform this derivation and calculation, arriving at the same numerical result of ~2.229. Any confusion in their final choice of letter is due to the options being shuffled in their versions of the question.\n\nBased on the physics, the logical deduction, and the numerical calculation, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

However, many of them make a mistake when matching their calculated value (which is consistently ~2.229) to the lettered options provided in the original question prompt. For instance, some calculate 2.229 but select option D.\n*   Ignoring the inconsistent final choices of the candidates and relying on the correct physical derivation and calculation, the answer is unequivocally ~2.23.

Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star acting as a black body is given by  L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength (λ_rest), i.e., T ∝ 1/λ_rest.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a star is shifted based on its radial velocity (v_r). For speeds much less than the speed of light (v_r << c), this is given by the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v_r/c).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Use the Radius Information:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so the radius ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Plugging this in gives:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):**\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁.\n    *   We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   Now, we apply the Doppler effect to each star to relate the observed wavelength to the rest wavelength.\n        *   For Star 1: v_r1 = 0. There is no Doppler shift, so λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n        *   For Star 2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted, so λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v_r2/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions for them equal to each other:\n        λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v_r2/c).\n    *   Rearranging this equation gives us the ratio of the rest wavelengths:\n        λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v_r2/c)]⁴\n\n5.  **Numerical Evaluation:** We plug in the values: v_r2 = 700 km/s (or 700,000 m/s) and c ≈ 300,000 km/s (or 299,792,458 m/s).\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\n**4.

For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Solution**\n*   First, we establish the luminosity ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n*   We are given that $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.

Understand the Fundamental Principles**\n\nThe solution to this problem relies on two key principles of physics regarding black body radiation:\n\n*   **The Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T). The total luminosity (L), which is the total power radiated, is therefore given by $L = A \\sigma T^4$, where A is the surface area and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. For a spherical star of radius R, the area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$, so the formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law states that the peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{emit}$).\n*   **The Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{obs}$) from a moving source is shifted relative to its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$). For a source moving with radial velocity $v_r$, the non-relativistic approximation is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$). Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n\nThe constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n**3. Substitute Known Ratios and Derive Unknowns**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the ratio $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$. Substituting this into our equation gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This requires more steps.\n    1.  From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* peak wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{emit,2}}{\\lambda_{emit,1}}$.\n    2.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    3.  We relate the observed and emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect for each star.\n        *   For Star 1: $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{emit,1}$.\n        *   For Star 2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is Doppler-shifted. $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set their expressions equal: $\\lambda_{emit,1} = \\lambda_{emit,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  Rearranging to get the ratio we need for the temperature: $\\frac{\\lambda_{emit,2}}{\\lambda_{emit,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    6.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, substitute the temperature ratio back into the main luminosity equation:\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$ (Speed of light)\n\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700,000}{299,792,458}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.00233496)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291$\n\n**5.

For non-relativistic speeds (where v << c), the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest(1 + v/c). A positive velocity indicates the source is moving away.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nThe constants (4π and σ) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)^4**\n\n### **4. Calculate the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the ratio (R₁ / R₂) = 1.5. Squaring this gives (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:**\n    1.  From Wien's Law (T ∝ 1/λ_rest), the temperature ratio is the inverse of the rest-frame peak wavelength ratio: **T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁**.\n    2.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    3.  For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is equal to its rest wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    4.  For Star_2, the radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is Doppler shifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    5.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    6.  Rearranging to find the wavelength ratio needed for the temperature calculation: **λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n    7.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)**.\n\n### **5.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n**2. Core Physics Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is a constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), i.e., $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius ratio $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\nPlugging this in:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\nThis means the final answer will be close to, but slightly different from, 2.25. The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is related to the *intrinsic* wavelengths: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n*   We need to relate the intrinsic wavelengths to the observed wavelengths using the Doppler effect. The problem states the *observed* wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n*   For Star 1, the radial velocity $v_1 = 0$, so its observed wavelength equals its intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n*   For Star 2, the radial velocity $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Now we can find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   $v_2 = 700$ km/s\n*   $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700}{300000}}\\right)^4 $\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.002333...}\\right)^4 $\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times (0.997672)^4 $\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.990714 $\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.2291 $\n\n**7. Conclusion**\nThe calculated value for the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Rounding to two decimal places gives 2.23. This matches option B. The vast majority of the candidate answers arrive at this same numerical result, although some incorrectly map it to a different letter option. The correct physics and calculation lead to ~2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify the Core Physics Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. The total luminosity ($L$) of a spherical star with radius $R$ and surface temperature $T$ is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which its emitted radiation is at a maximum ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max}}$). This is expressed as $T = b/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max}}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The wavelength of light we observe ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its originally emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) if the source is moving relative to us. For non-relativistic speeds, this shift is given by $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for moving away) and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\nThe constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel, leaving:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Substitute Known Values**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius ratio is $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$. Squaring this gives $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not needed for this calculation based on black body radiation laws and can be ignored.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThis is the most complex part of the problem and requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is inversely related to the ratio of the *rest-frame* (emitted) peak wavelengths: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}}}$.\n*   We need to find the rest-frame wavelengths using the fact that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}}$).\n*   For Star_1, its radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$. Thus, there is no Doppler shift, and its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}}$.\n*   For Star_2, its radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is Doppler redshifted (since it's moving away): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions for them equal to each other:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Now, we rearrange this to get the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,max,1}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Result**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from step 4:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$ (Using a precise value doesn't significantly change the result for this problem)\n*   $\\frac{v_2}{c} \\approx \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.002333$\n\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 0.002333}\\right)^4 \\approx 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.002333}\\right)^4 \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $\n\n**7. Conclusion**\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Rounding to two decimal places gives 2.23. This matches option A. A review of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on this calculation and result, with minor discrepancies related to the choice of Doppler formula (relativistic vs. non-relativistic) and the precise value of 'c', neither of which affects the final answer when rounded.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

Identify the Relevant Physical Laws**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical black body is determined by its radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$). The formula is $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** An observer measures a different wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) than the one emitted ($\\lambda_{rest}$) if there is relative motion. For speeds much less than light ($v \\ll c$), the formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity.\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**4. Substitute Known Values: Radius**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. So, the radius ratio is $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\nPlugging this in gives:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThis is the most involved part of the derivation, where the Doppler effect is crucial.\n\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *rest* wavelength ratio:\n    $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} $\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n*   Let's apply the Doppler effect formula to each star:\n    *   For Star 1: $v_1 = 0$ km/s. Therefore, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Therefore, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the two expressions:\n    $ \\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c) $\n*   Now, rearrange this equation to find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $ \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $\n*   This means the temperature ratio is:\n    $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $\n\n**6.
