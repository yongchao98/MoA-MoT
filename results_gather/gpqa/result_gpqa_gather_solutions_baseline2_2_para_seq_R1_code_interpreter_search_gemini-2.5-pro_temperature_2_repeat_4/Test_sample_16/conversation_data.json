Analysis of the Scientific Method**\n\nAll fifteen candidate answers use the same correct chemical principles to solve the problem. The consensus methodology is as follows:\n\n*   **Identify the Equilibrium:** The core process is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex into its ions:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n*   **Use the Formation Constant (K_f):** The given formation constant, $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$, is for the reverse reaction. The equilibrium expression is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n*   **Set up an ICE Table:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is used to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the dissociated $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    *   Initial: $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ = 0.02 M; $[Ca^{2+}]$ = 0 M; $[EDTA^{4-}]$ = 0 M.\n    *   Equilibrium: $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ = 0.02 - x; $[Ca^{2+}]$ = x; $[EDTA^{4-}]$ = x.\n*   **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substituting the equilibrium values into the K_f expression gives:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n*   **Apply a Valid Approximation:** Because K_f is extremely large, the amount of dissociation ('x') is negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M).

Evaluation of Candidate Answers**\n\nEvery candidate successfully calculates the correct numerical answer, approximately **6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M**.

This numerical value corresponds to option **D**. Any answer selecting A, B, or C is incorrect, likely due to a misreading or shuffling of the options. The scientific reasoning is sound across all answers, but only the conclusion that points to option D is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem involves a solution containing the calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻` or `[CaY]²⁻`. This complex is stable but exists in a dynamic equilibrium where it slightly dissociates into free calcium ions (`Ca²⁺`) and the EDTA ligand (`EDTA⁴⁻` or `Y⁴⁻`). The relevant reaction for finding the free calcium concentration is the dissociation of the complex:\n\n`[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`\n\n**2. Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants**\nThe problem provides the **formation constant** (`K_f` or `K_Ca-EDTA`), which measures the stability of the complex. It corresponds to the reverse of the dissociation reaction:\n\n*   Formation reaction: `Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻`\n*   Formation constant expression: `K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰`\n\nA very large `K_f` value indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and only a tiny amount will be present as free ions.\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) Table**\nWe start with a stoichiometric concentration of the complex of 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| `[CaY]²⁻`       | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| `Ca²⁺`          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| `Y⁴⁻`           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nThe question asks for the concentration of calcium ions, which is represented by 'x' at equilibrium.\n\n**4. Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nWe substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the table into the formation constant expression:\n\n`5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)`\n`5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²`\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant (`K_f`) is extremely large, the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be minuscule compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore simplify the numerator without significant loss of accuracy:\n\n`0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n\n`5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²`\n\n**6. Calculate the Value of x**\nNow, we rearrange the simplified equation to solve for 'x':\n\n*   Rearrange for `x²`:\n    `x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n*   Calculate the value of `x²`:\n    `x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³`\n*   Take the square root to find `x`:\n    `x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷` M\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, `[Ca²⁺]`, is `x`, which is approximately `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`. This result is numerically consistent across all the provided candidate answers. The variation in the final letters (A, B, C, D) is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nBased on the options listed in the original problem statement:\nA) 6.3x10^-7 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated value of `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Chemistry:** The problem involves a chemical equilibrium. We start with a solution of a stable complex, Calcium-EDTA, represented as $[CaY]^{2-}$. This complex slightly dissociates into free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and free EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$). The reaction is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the **formation constant** ($K_f$), which describes the creation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The value for this constant is enormous: $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    A very large $K_f$ signifies that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and only a tiny fraction will be dissociated at any given time.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equilibrium Calculation (ICE Table):** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n    *   **Initial:** The initial concentration of the complex $[CaY]^{2-}$ is 0.02 M. The initial concentrations of the free ions $Ca^{2+}$ and $Y^{4-}$ are 0.\n    *   **Change:** The concentration of the complex decreases by x, while the concentrations of the ions each increase by x.\n    *   **Equilibrium:**\n        *   $[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n        *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n        *   $[Y^{4-}] = x$\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression and Solve:** We plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:** Because $K_f$ is so large, we know that 'x' (the amount of dissociated complex) will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows us to simplify the equation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n    The expression becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate 'x':** Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions we want to find.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Final Decision:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Reviewing the provided options in the question:\n    A) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    B) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    C) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    D) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated value directly matches option A. The unanimous agreement on the numerical result across all candidate answers, despite their different final letter choices (due to randomized option ordering), confirms the calculation is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Consensus on Methodology:** All candidate answers correctly identify the chemical equilibrium involved: the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. They all use a standard and appropriate method, the ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table, to set up the problem.\n    -   Reaction: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    -   Equilibrium Expression: The answers correctly use either the formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) or the dissociation constant ($K_d = 1/K_f = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$). Both approaches are valid.\n    -   Setup: $[CaY]^{2-} = 0.02 - x$; $[Ca^{2+}] = x$; $[Y^{4-}] = x$. This leads to the equation $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$ or $K_d = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$.\n\n2.  **Consensus on Calculation:** All candidates correctly recognize that because the formation constant is very large (or the dissociation constant is very small), the amount of dissociation, 'x', is negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This justifies the approximation $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    -   This leads to the simplified equation: $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    -   Solving for x:\n        -   $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n        -   $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n        -   $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} M$\n\n3.  **Inconsistency in Final Answer Selection:** Although all the agents correctly calculated the numerical value to be approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, there is confusion in matching this value to the correct lettered option. This appears to be due to inconsistent listing of the multiple-choice options or simple selection errors in some candidate responses.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Define the Equilibrium:** We start with the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into its ions. The reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant ($K_f$):** We are given the formation constant:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Let 'x' be the concentration of calcium ions at equilibrium.\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for $K_f$:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply the Approximation:** Since $K_f$ is very large, 'x' will be very small. Therefore, we can approximate $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate 'x':**\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} M$\n\n7.  **Match to Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

They all use the concept of equilibrium for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The process involves:\n    *   Writing the dissociation reaction: `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`.\n    *   Using the given formation constant, `K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰`.\n    *   Setting up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table with initial `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻` = 0.02 M.\n    *   Substituting the equilibrium concentrations (`[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02-x`, `[Ca²⁺] = x`, `[EDTA⁴⁻] = x`) into the equilibrium expression: `K_f = (0.02 - x) / x²`.\n    *   Making the valid approximation that `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` due to the very large `K_f`.\n    *   Solving the simplified equation: `5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²`.\n\n2.  **Numerical Result:** Every single candidate correctly calculates the value of 'x' (the concentration of Ca²⁺).\n    *   `x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 4 x 10⁻¹³`\n    *   `x ≈ sqrt(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`\n    There is a unanimous consensus on the numerical result being `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`.\n\n3.  **Matching with Options:** The discrepancy among the candidate answers lies in mapping the calculated numerical result to the lettered options.

However, many of them seemed to have a scrambled list of options, leading them to select letters other than C (e.g., A, B, or D), even though their selected answer corresponded to the value `6.3x10⁻⁷ M` in their own scrambled list. The agents that correctly matched the calculated value to the original list of options (e.g., Answers 2, 7, 10, and 14) arrived at the correct final conclusion. Based on the overwhelming agreement on the calculation and by matching it to the provided options, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the calculation methodology and the final numerical result, despite inconsistencies in the lettering of the multiple-choice options.\n\nHere is a consolidated step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium:** The core of the problem is the dissociation of the stable Ca-EDTA complex, which we can represent as $[CaY]^{2-}$. The equilibrium is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the **formation constant** ($K_f$) for the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The value is given as $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. A very large $K_f$ indicates that the complex is very stable and will not dissociate much.\n\n3.  **ICE Table Setup:** To find the equilibrium concentrations, an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is the standard approach. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n    *   **Initial:** $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02$ M; $[Ca^{2+}] = 0$; $[Y^{4-}] = 0$.\n    *   **Change:** $[[CaY]^{2-}]$ decreases by x; $[Ca^{2+}]$ increases by x; $[Y^{4-}]$ increases by x.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$; $[Ca^{2+}] = x$; $[Y^{4-}] = x$.\n\n4.  **Mathematical Solution:** The equilibrium concentrations can be substituted into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplifying Approximation:** Because $K_f$ is extremely large, the dissociation 'x' will be negligibly small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows for a valid simplification:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Solving for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Solving for x, which is the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll candidate answers correctly followed this logical path and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. The differences in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) appear to be due to inconsistent labeling of the options in the source material for each agent. Based on the options provided in the problem statement, the value $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation method, even though the final letter chosen varies. The discrepancies in the final letter appear to arise from inconsistencies in how the multiple-choice options were listed in each agent's response. However, the underlying scientific reasoning is sound and consistent. Here is a step-by-step resolution of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution made from 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex will dissociate to a small extent to reach equilibrium. The relevant chemical reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Use the Formation Constant ($K_f$)**\nWe are given the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the equilibrium for the formation of the complex (the reverse reaction):\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\nThe value is $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\nThe equilibrium expression for this is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Set Up an ICE Table**\nAn ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table helps track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$    |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$             |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n\n**4. Solve for 'x'**\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the formation constant expression:\n$K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can therefore simplify the equation by assuming:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Value of 'x'**\nNow, rearrange the equation to solve for 'x':\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n**7.

We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x' to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species     | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$  | 0.02 M      | -x         | (0.02 - x) M    |\n| $Ca^{2+}$     | 0 M         | +x         | x M             |\n| $Y^{4-}$      | 0 M         | +x         | x M             |\n\n    The quantity we need to find is 'x', the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    We substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the table into the expression for the formation constant:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:**\n    The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is an extremely large number. This tells us that the equilibrium heavily favors the complex, and only a tiny amount will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligibly small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the well-justified approximation that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Value of 'x':**\n    The simplified equation is much easier to solve:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for 'x':\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Take the square root of both sides:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    (A check of the assumption shows that 6.32e-7 is indeed negligible compared to 0.02, as it represents only about 0.003% of the initial concentration).\n\n7.  **Match the Result to the Provided Options:**\n    The calculated equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately **6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M**. Now we compare this numerical result to the options given in the problem statement:\n    A) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    B) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    C) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated value directly matches option B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct methodology involves setting up an equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex and using the given formation constant. A key step is making the valid approximation that the change in the complex's concentration is negligible due to the very large $K_f$. The unanimous calculation across all candidate answers confirms the resulting concentration of calcium ions is **6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem involves a solution containing the calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as `[Ca-EDTA]²⁻` or `[CaY]²⁻`. This complex is stable but exists in a dynamic equilibrium where it slightly dissociates into free calcium ions (`Ca²⁺`) and the EDTA ligand (`EDTA⁴⁻` or `Y⁴⁻`). The relevant reaction for finding the free calcium concentration is the dissociation of the complex:\n\n`[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`\n\n**2. Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants**\nThe problem provides the **formation constant** (`K_f` or `K_Ca-EDTA`), which measures the stability of the complex. It corresponds to the reverse of the dissociation reaction:\n\n*   Formation reaction: `Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻`\n*   Formation constant expression: `K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰`\n\nA very large `K_f` value indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and only a tiny amount will be present as free ions.\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) Table**\nWe start with a stoichiometric concentration of the complex of 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| `[CaY]²⁻`       | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| `Ca²⁺`          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| `Y⁴⁻`           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nThe question asks for the concentration of calcium ions, which is represented by 'x' at equilibrium.\n\n**4. Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nWe substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the table into the formation constant expression:\n\n`5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)`\n`5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²`\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\nBecause the formation constant (`K_f`) is extremely large, the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be minuscule compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore simplify the numerator without significant loss of accuracy:\n\n`0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n\n`5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²`\n\n**6. Calculate the Value of x**\nNow, we rearrange the simplified equation to solve for 'x':\n\n*   Rearrange for `x²`:\n    `x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)`\n*   Calculate the value of `x²`:\n    `x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³`\n*   Take the square root to find `x`:\n    `x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷` M\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, `[Ca²⁺]`, is `x`, which is approximately `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M`. This result is numerically consistent across all the provided candidate answers. The variation in the final letters (A, B, C, D) is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nBased on the options listed in the original problem statement:\nA) 6.3x10^-7 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated value of `6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Chemistry:** The problem involves a chemical equilibrium. We start with a solution of a stable complex, Calcium-EDTA, represented as $[CaY]^{2-}$. This complex slightly dissociates into free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and free EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$). The reaction is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the **formation constant** ($K_f$), which describes the creation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The value for this constant is enormous: $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    A very large $K_f$ signifies that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and only a tiny fraction will be dissociated at any given time.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equilibrium Calculation (ICE Table):** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n    *   **Initial:** The initial concentration of the complex $[CaY]^{2-}$ is 0.02 M.

This is a classic equilibrium problem involving the dissociation of a stable complex.\n\n2.  **Set Up the Equilibrium Reaction**: The Ca-EDTA complex, which we can write as $[CaY]^{2-}$, dissociates into its ions:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$ (where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand).\n\n3.  **Use the Correct Equilibrium Constant**: We are given the formation constant ($K_f$) for the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The expression for this is $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n4.  **Construct an ICE Table**: To find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table based on the dissociation reaction.

Analysis of the Scientific Method**\nAll candidate answers follow the same correct scientific and mathematical procedure:\n*   **Identify the equilibrium:** The problem starts with the Ca-EDTA complex, so the relevant equilibrium is its dissociation:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n*   **Identify the Equilibrium Constant:** The given constant is the formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$), which describes the reverse reaction. The agents correctly use this constant.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n*   **Set up an ICE Table:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is correctly used. Starting with 0.02 M of the complex, the equilibrium concentrations are established as:\n    *   $[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n    *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n    *   $[EDTA^{4-}] = x$\n*   **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** The equilibrium expression is set up:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n*   **Apply the Approximation:** Due to the very large value of $K_f$, the amount of dissociation, 'x', is extremely small compared to 0.02. Therefore, the approximation $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$ is valid and correctly applied by all agents.\n*   **Calculate the Final Value:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    Rearranging and solving for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**2. Consensus on the Numerical Result**\nAll 15 candidate answers arrive at the same numerical result: the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is **6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Final Answer Choice**\nThe discrepancy between the letters chosen by the agents (A, B, C, or D) stems from the fact that they were presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The core task is to match the correct numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe options for this question are:\nA) 6.3x10^-7 M\nB) 1.0x10^-2 M\nC) 2.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe universally agreed-upon calculation yields a result of $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, which corresponds directly to **Option A**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
