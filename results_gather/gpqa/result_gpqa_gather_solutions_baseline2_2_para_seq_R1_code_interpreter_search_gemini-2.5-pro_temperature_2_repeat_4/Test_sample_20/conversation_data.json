The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to two carbonyl groups. They possess acidic alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to readily tautomerize into its highly stable aromatic enol form (phloroglucinol). Therefore, it **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds; they are sp²-hybridized. They do not have the type of alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon required for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Decision for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n1.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has a chiral center and lacks symmetry, the molecule is chiral.

A crucial requirement for this is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   Alpha-hydrogens: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. They possess alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Conclusion: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism. It readily converts to its extremely stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups.\n    *   Alpha-hydrogens: The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized and lack the required type of alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Conclusion: Benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers agree on this point based on sound chemical reasoning.\n\n**Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Chiral Center: The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Conclusion: Since it has a chiral center and lacks symmetry, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and *will* show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It has a *trans* geometry around the C=C double bond.\n    *   Chiral Center: There are no chiral centers.\n    *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion).\n    *   Conclusion: Due to its symmetry, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and *will not* show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers agree on this point, again based on correct principles.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   **B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers provide the correct chemical reasoning, several make a final error in mapping their reasoning to the correct letter option. The logically derived answer is unambiguously B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe first part of the question asks to identify the compound from the pair (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) that does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For this to occur, a molecule with a carbonyl group (keto form) must have a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized for the typical mechanism to proceed, allowing for the formation of an enol (an alcohol adjacent to a double bond).\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups (C=O). Between the ketone groups are methylene groups (-CH₂-). The carbons in these -CH₂- groups are sp³ hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. Therefore, the hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. Because these alpha-hydrogens are present, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can and does undergo extensive tautomerism to form its very stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol. Thus, it **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized and lack the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone **cannot** undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound from the pair (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate & dimethyl fumarate) **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will** exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the double bond. The molecule does not have any carbon bonded to four different groups (no chiral center). Furthermore, the molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Achiral molecules are superimposable on their mirror images and do **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **The question asks which compound *does not* show tautomerism.**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (alpha-hydrogen). An α-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups separated by -CH₂- groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. They possess α-hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism, readily converting to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. They lack the necessary type of α-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **The question asks which compound *will* show optical isomerism.**\n    *   A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and *will* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule (around the double bond) and it possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral. Since it is achiral, it *will not* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Combine the results and choose the final answer.**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches the choice: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   Looking at the provided options, this corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**The Goal**: Identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism**: Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for a ketone to undergo keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**:\n    *   Structure: p-benzoquinone has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   Conclusion: These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.**\n3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   Structure: It has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, separated by -CH₂- groups at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are alpha-carbons. They each have two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Conclusion: The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily undergo tautomerization to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is highly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n**Result for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**The Goal**: Identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules.

Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.**\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   Structure: This is the *trans* isomer with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   Chirality: The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   Conclusion: Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.

The most common type, keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (alpha-hydrogen) — a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized for the process to occur easily.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound's structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the methylene groups are alpha to the carbonyl groups.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens).\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic and highly stable compound, making the tautomerization process highly favorable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized. They lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Answer for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Define the key concept:** Optical isomerism is shown by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that gives rise to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups.\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).

For this process to occur readily, the α-carbon should be sp³-hybridized.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyls are part of the double bonds and are therefore sp²-hybridized. They lack the necessary α-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure has three C=O groups separated by -CH₂- groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and have two α-hydrogens each. These hydrogens are highly acidic, allowing the compound to readily tautomerize to its exceptionally stable aromatic enol form (phloroglucinol). Thus, it does show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. The reasoning across all candidate answers is unanimous on this point.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Question:** Identify the compound that **will show** optical isomerism.\n    *   **Concept:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Thus, it will show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not have a chiral center and is achiral.

An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom bonded to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl group (C=O). The migration of this proton and a shift in double bonds creates the enol form.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens.

For a compound to exhibit this, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This is called an alpha-hydrogen, and its carbon must be sp³ hybridized to allow for the easy formation of the enol form.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the required type of alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups separated by methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³ hybridized and are adjacent to two carbonyl groups each. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens, which are quite acidic, allows the compound to readily tautomerize into its stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Concept of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center). A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis. First, we must determine which of the two given compounds does not exhibit tautomerism. Second, we must determine which of the other two compounds shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Condition for Tautomerism:** The most common type of tautomerism, keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The migration of this hydrogen atom allows the molecule to interconvert between its keto and enol forms.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are alpha-hydrogens because they are on sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. In fact, being flanked by two carbonyl groups makes these hydrogens particularly acidic and readily involved in tautomerism. The resulting enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, making it extremely stable. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism**.\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds; they are sp²-hybridized.

A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule's structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* position across the double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar, making it achiral.

This equilibrium requires the presence of an **α-hydrogen** (alpha-hydrogen), which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.

    "This problem requires a two-part analysis to determine the correct compounds for labels (A) and (B), followed by selecting the matching multiple-choice option.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Core Principle:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). The essential requirement for this interconversion is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (α-H), which is a hydrogen atom attached to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring structure with three carbonyl (C=O) groups separated by three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Therefore, the hydrogens attached to them are α-hydrogens. Because of these available α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism, readily converting to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required α-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, benzoquinone **does not** show keto-enol tautomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Core Principle:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry, it is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nWe now match this combination with the provided options:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination of our findings corresponds exactly with option B. It is worth noting that while the chemical reasoning provided in all the candidate answers is almost unanimously correct, many of them make a simple error in matching their correct result to the final lettered option.

All candidate answers agree on this point based on sound chemical reasoning.\n\n**Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Principle:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The logically derived answer is unambiguously B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe first part of the question asks to identify the compound from the pair (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) that does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** The most common form of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism. For this to occur, a molecule with a carbonyl group (keto form) must have a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized for the typical mechanism to proceed, allowing for the formation of an enol (an alcohol adjacent to a double bond).\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups (C=O). Between the ketone groups are methylene groups (-CH₂-). The carbons in these -CH₂- groups are sp³ hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. Therefore, the hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens. Because these alpha-hydrogens are present, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can and does undergo extensive tautomerism to form its very stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol. Thus, it **does** show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized and lack the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone **cannot** undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second part of the question asks to identify which compound from the pair (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate & dimethyl fumarate) **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will** exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the double bond. The molecule does not have any carbon bonded to four different groups (no chiral center). Furthermore, the molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Achiral molecules are superimposable on their mirror images and do **not** show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **The question asks which compound *does not* show tautomerism.**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (alpha-hydrogen). An α-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups separated by -CH₂- groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. They possess α-hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism, readily converting to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. They lack the necessary type of α-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and *will* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule (around the double bond) and it possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral. Since it is achiral, it *will not* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Combine the results and choose the final answer.**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches the choice: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   Looking at the provided options, this corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**The Goal**: Identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism**: Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for a ketone to undergo keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**:\n    *   Structure: p-benzoquinone has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   Conclusion: These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.**\n3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   Structure: It has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, separated by -CH₂- groups at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Alpha-carbons: The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are alpha-carbons. They each have two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Conclusion: The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the molecule to readily undergo tautomerization to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is highly stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n**Result for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**The Goal**: Identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism**: Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules.

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Condition for Keto-Enol Tautomerism**: A molecule must have an alpha-hydrogen (α-H), which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups.\n    *   The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Therefore, the hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Conclusion: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* have alpha-hydrogens and readily shows tautomerism. It tautomerizes to the very stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone)**:\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite ends and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   Conclusion: Benzoquinone does not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Therefore, it **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Result for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Optical Isomerism**: This is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Condition for Chirality**: A common indicator is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (the one bonded to the -OH group).

The molecule is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* position across the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups (no chiral center).\n    *   Furthermore, it possesses a center of symmetry and is planar, which makes it achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Step 3: Combine Results and Select the Final Answer\n\n*   **Compound (A)** = benzoquinone\n*   **Compound (B)** = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nNow we match this result with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from the analysis perfectly matches option **B**.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while many of them deduced the correct chemical facts (A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), they made an error in selecting the corresponding letter for their final answer. The agents whose reasoning and final answer were both correct and consistent all chose option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe question is divided into two parts: determining which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which one shows optical isomerism (B).\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Define the key concept:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two interconvertible isomers (tautomers). The most common type, keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (alpha-hydrogen) — a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon must typically be sp³ hybridized for the process to occur easily.\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound's structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The carbon atoms of the methylene groups are alpha to the carbonyl groups.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms (alpha-hydrogens).\n    *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic and highly stable compound, making the tautomerization process highly favorable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized. They lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n4.  **Answer for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Define the key concept:** Optical isomerism is shown by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that gives rise to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups.\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C bond and is planar. Any molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n4.  **Answer for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this pair with the provided options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Question:** Identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism.\n    *   **Concept:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen). For this process to occur readily, the α-carbon should be sp³-hybridized.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyls are part of the double bonds and are therefore sp²-hybridized. They lack the necessary α-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure has three C=O groups separated by -CH₂- groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and have two α-hydrogens each. These hydrogens are highly acidic, allowing the compound to readily tautomerize to its exceptionally stable aromatic enol form (phloroglucinol). Thus, it does show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. The reasoning across all candidate answers is unanimous on this point.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Question:** Identify the compound that **will show** optical isomerism.\n    *   **Concept:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Thus, it will show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry. It does not have a chiral center and is achiral. Thus, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. The reasoning across all candidate answers is also unanimous on this point.\n\n3.  **Final Combination and Selection**\n    *   We have determined that A = **benzoquinone** and B = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   We now match this combination with the given options:\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   C) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n        *   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination of A and B matches option C. Although the candidate answers show discrepancies in their final letter choice, their detailed chemical reasoning unanimously supports the same conclusions for both parts of the question, which unambiguously points to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThis part of the question asks to identify which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** exhibit tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** The most common form, keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom bonded to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl group (C=O). The migration of this proton and a shift in double bonds creates the enol form.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens. They are attached to sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has the necessary alpha-hydrogens and **does** show tautomerism. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is highly stable due to aromaticity.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and lack the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** meet the criteria for keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThis part asks which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral.

For a compound to exhibit this, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This is called an alpha-hydrogen, and its carbon must be sp³ hybridized to allow for the easy formation of the enol form.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the required type of alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups separated by methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³ hybridized and are adjacent to two carbonyl groups each. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens, which are quite acidic, allows the compound to readily tautomerize into its stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Concept of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center). A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis. First, we must determine which of the two given compounds does not exhibit tautomerism. Second, we must determine which of the other two compounds shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Condition for Tautomerism:** The most common type of tautomerism, keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The migration of this hydrogen atom allows the molecule to interconvert between its keto and enol forms.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are alpha-hydrogens because they are on sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. In fact, being flanked by two carbonyl groups makes these hydrogens particularly acidic and readily involved in tautomerism. The resulting enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, making it extremely stable. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism**.\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds; they are sp²-hybridized.

This equilibrium requires the presence of an **α-hydrogen** (alpha-hydrogen), which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. For standard keto-enol tautomerism, this alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not possess the type of hydrogen atom required for keto-enol tautomerism.

Based on the unanimous and correct chemical reasoning presented by all candidates, the logically derived answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Question:** Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione), which one does **not** show tautomerism?\n\n1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** The key concept is keto-enol tautomerism. This is a chemical equilibrium between a \"keto\" form (containing a C=O group) and an \"enol\" form (containing a C=C-OH group). For this to occur, a molecule typically needs an **alpha-hydrogen** — a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   This molecule is a ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups. These are sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to the carbonyls, and the hydrogens attached to them are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Because it possesses these alpha-hydrogens, it **does** exhibit tautomerism. It can convert to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is very stable due to being aromatic.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   This molecule is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon.\n    *   Therefore, benzoquinone **does not** exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Question:** Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism?\n\n1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (the one attached to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond (*trans* configuration).\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   It is planar and has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the double bond. Molecules with a center of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these findings with the provided options:\n*   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, referencing the consensus from the candidate answers and verifying the chemical principles involved.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **The Goal**: Identify which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Key Concept**: Keto-enol tautomerism, the most common type, requires a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups alternating with three CH₂ (methylene) groups.\n    *   The hydrogens on the CH₂ groups are alpha-hydrogens because the carbons are adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione possesses the necessary alpha-hydrogens and readily undergoes tautomerism. In fact, its enol form (phloroglucinol) is an aromatic ring, which is highly stable, making tautomerism a very favorable process.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**:\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized.\n    *   There are no alpha-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Benzoquinone does *not* meet the requirement for standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Decision for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **The Goal**: Identify which of the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Key Concept**: Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, making the entire molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   Its structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses elements of symmetry (a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry), which make it an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate does *not* show optical isomerism.\n*   **Decision for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination**\n\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is A.
