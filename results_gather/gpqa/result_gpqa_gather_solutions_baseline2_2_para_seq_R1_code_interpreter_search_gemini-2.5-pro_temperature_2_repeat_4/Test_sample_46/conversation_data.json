For C9H11NO2, this is 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O). This is a point of universal agreement among all the candidate analyses.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** All analyses correctly identify these two distinct, medium-to-strong bands as the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This is due to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This key piece of evidence rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** All analyses correctly identify this strong band as a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (e.g., ~1680 cm⁻¹).\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** There is universal agreement that this triplet-quartet pair is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. Critically, the very high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of the ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** All analyses correctly assign this broad singlet, which integrates to two protons, to the protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is universally and correctly identified as the hallmark pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (like -NH₂) and the other is electron-withdrawing (like -COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options\n*   The data from all three techniques consistently points to a single structure: a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n*   This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Now, we match this structure to the given options:\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (meta-substitution, amide, not ester).\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (the quartet for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm).\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct. This structure perfectly matches all of the provided data.**\n    *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester).\n\n### Conclusion\nAll fifteen candidate answers correctly identified the structure as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through their chemical reasoning. Any discrepancies in their final letters were due to clerical errors in mapping the correct structure to the corresponding letter option. The correct structure, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires identifying an unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 based on its Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra. All candidate analyses follow a similar, correct, step-by-step approach.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two distinct bands are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH2)**, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. The value is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which would be < 1700 cm-1).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The triplet is the -CH3 group, and the quartet is the -CH2- group. The high chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH2)** protons. The signal is broad due to proton exchange and coupling to the nitrogen nucleus.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n\n**4. Structure Assembly and Verification:**\n*   **Fragments:** The spectra reveal three key pieces: (1) a para-disubstituted benzene ring, (2) a primary amine group (-NH2), and (3) an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Assembly:** Placing these fragments together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   **Verification:** This structure is fully consistent with all data. The primary amine is an electron-donating group, which shields its ortho-protons, corresponding to the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm. The ethyl ester is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields its ortho-protons, corresponding to the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm. The structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options:**\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (-CO-CH2CH3), not an ethoxy group. The -CH2- quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide (inconsistent with IR C=O frequency) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent with NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Perfectly matches all spectroscopic evidence.\n\nAll candidate agents correctly identify the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through sound reasoning. The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to be from inconsistent re-labeling of the options within their reasoning process. Based on the original prompt's list, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectral data, here is the reasoning to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three pi bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are a definitive signature for a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This rules out any structure with a secondary amine or amide (like option D).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is characteristic of an ester C=O stretch that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (options A and D), which usually appears below 1700 cm-1.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen atom of an ester (-CO-O-CH2CH3). This rules out option B (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the CH2 group of the ethyl chain is attached to the carbonyl (C=O) and would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2), confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This rules out option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would give a more complex pattern. The two different chemical shifts indicate one substituent is electron-donating (the -NH2 group, shielding its ortho protons to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, deshielding its ortho protons to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combined data points unequivocally to a structure with:\n*   A 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH2) substituent.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) substituent.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which corresponds to option C.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect (meta substitution, amide not ester).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect (NMR chemical shift for the ethyl group would be different).\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Perfect match for all data.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect (secondary amide, not primary amine and ester).\n\nAll provided candidate analyses, despite some confusion with the final letter designations, reach the same conclusion through sound chemical reasoning: the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a spectroscopic puzzle. The goal is to determine the correct structure of C9H11NO2 from four possible options using the provided IR and 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three pi bonds) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two distinct bands are the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2), corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This points to a structure with an -NH2 group.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is in the range of a conjugated ester. It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a simple alkyl ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), but fits perfectly for an ester conjugated to a benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group (-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2), confirming the IR analysis. Broadness is expected due to nitrogen's properties and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The separation in their chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, shielding its ortho protons (the signal at 7.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, deshielding its ortho protons (the signal at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Conclusion by Assembling the Pieces**\n\nThe evidence from all spectra points to a single structure:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is meta-substituted and an amide, inconsistent with the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR carbonyl frequency.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the NMR signal for the -CH2- of the ethyl group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the oxygen, and would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the comprehensive analyses provided, a step-by-step logical deduction leads to the identification of the unknown compound. Here is a breakdown of the key points derived from the consensus of the candidate answers:\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula C9H11NO2 gives a Degree of Unsaturation of 5.\n*   This is a strong indication of a benzene ring (DoU = 4) plus one additional double bond (DoU = 1), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum:**\n*   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out any structure with a secondary or tertiary amine.\n*   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. Its specific frequency suggests it is from a conjugated **ester**, not an amide (which would typically be at a lower frequency, <1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   The combination of a triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** and a quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)** is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) proves that the -CH₂- group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the ester oxygen (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This single point is crucial for distinguishing between isomers.\n*   The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (2H)** confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which supports the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   The two doublets at **7.0 ppm (2H)** and **8.0 ppm (2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (causing an upfield shift) and the other is electron-withdrawing (causing a downfield shift).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Final Verification:**\n*   The identified fragments are: a primary amine (-NH₂), an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   Assembling these pieces results in **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data. The electron-donating -NH₂ group accounts for the upfield aromatic doublet (~7.0 ppm), and the electron-withdrawing ester group accounts for the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm).\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the NMR signal for the ethyl's -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with the IR carbonyl frequency and the NMR aromatic pattern.\n\nThe conclusion from all candidate answers is unanimous and well-supported: the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl (C=O) group, given the two oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the typical ~1735 cm-1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** as part of an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons in this region is characteristic of the protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** identified from the IR data. The broadness is caused by quadrupole coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding protons, moving them upfield) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding protons, moving them downfield).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Verify**\n    *   The fragments we've identified are: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Assembling these pieces leads to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check the structure against the NMR data. The amino group (-NH2) is electron-donating, so it would shield its ortho protons, causing them to appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield). This matches the signal at **7.0 ppm**. The ester group (-COOCH2CH3) is electron-withdrawing, so it would deshield its ortho protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). This matches the signal at **8.0 ppm**. The structure is a perfect fit for all the data.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of a propionyl chain (-CO-CH2CH3). The quartet for this -CH2- would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data showing a primary amine. Incorrect.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted (1,3-) compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis of the formula, IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum consistently and unambiguously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The first step is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) or Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). This tells us the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This key piece of evidence rules out any compound with a secondary amine (which would only have one N-H band, like option D) or a tertiary amine (which would have no N-H bands).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester** functional group, specifically one that is conjugated with a double bond or aromatic ring. An amide C=O group (options B and D) would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹). This strongly favors an ester structure.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet represents the methyl (-CH₃) protons being split by the two methylene (-CH₂-) protons. The quartet represents the methylene protons being split by the three methyl protons. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is crucial; it indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which, given the IR data pointing to an ester, is almost certainly the ester oxygen atom (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This chemical shift and shape are characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus. This confirms the conclusion drawn from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shift indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n    *   The data clearly identifies three structural fragments:\n        1.  A primary amine group (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n        2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n        3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n    *   Combining these pieces leads directly to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this conclusion against the options:\n        *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this structure, the ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl (C=O), and its -CH₂- signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a *meta*-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern. It is also an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n        *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence: the molecular formula, the primary amine and ester IR bands, and all NMR signals (ethyl group, primary amine protons, and para-substituted ring pattern with appropriate electronic effects).\n        *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data indicating a primary amine.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry structure elucidation problem. To identify the correct compound, we need to systematically analyze each piece of spectroscopic data and see which of the candidate structures fits all the data points.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the hallmark of a **primary amine (-NH2)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This eliminates option A (a secondary amide) which would show only one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide (like in option D), which would absorb at a lower frequency (closer to 1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The triplet represents the -CH3 group, and the quartet represents the adjacent -CH2- group. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which confirms it's bonded to an oxygen, as in an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**. This is a crucial point that helps distinguish between ester isomers.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the -NH2 protons of the primary amine. The signal is broad due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This pattern eliminates option D (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would produce a more complex splitting pattern. The significant chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (e.g., -NH2), which shields the adjacent protons (upfield signal at 7.0 ppm), and the other is electron-withdrawing (e.g., -COOCH2CH3), which deshields the adjacent protons (downfield signal at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   The data clearly points to a structure containing a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). This assembly corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. It's a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all data points: the formula, the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, the para-disubstituted ring, and the specific NMR chemical shifts.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer (H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3). In this structure, the quartet of the ethyl group would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, not the ester oxygen, and would have a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. It is an amide (inconsistent with the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR band) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent with the para-splitting pattern in the NMR).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to understand the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond (the 5th DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity):** The presence of two distinct absorption bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester**, specifically one whose carbonyl group is conjugated with a benzene ring. This frequency is generally too high for an amide.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is a definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) is the -CH₃ group, split by its two neighboring protons.\n    *   The quartet (q) is the -CH₂ group, split by its three neighboring protons.\n    *   The significant downfield shift of the quartet to **4.5 ppm** indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen atom in an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the compound is an **ethyl ester**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift and characteristic broadness (due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and hydrogen exchange) confirm the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The significant chemical shift difference between the doublets confirms that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) while the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nWe have identified the following fragments:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together yields only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is also consistent with the electronic effects seen in the NMR: the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine appear upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted, inconsistent with the para-substituted NMR pattern. It is also an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all pieces of spectral data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acid component (propionyl group). The -CH₂- of the ethyl group would be next to a C=O, giving a signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThe spectral data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the spectroscopic problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which tells us the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   **Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n### **2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively. This fact immediately rules out any structure that does not contain a primary amine, such as option **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which has a secondary amide (-NH-).\n*   **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency helps identify the functional group type:\n    *   Amides (like options A and D) typically show a C=O stretch at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Esters typically show a C=O stretch around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹. Conjugation with a benzene ring lowers this frequency to the observed range (~1715-1730 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Therefore, the band at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests a **conjugated ester**, not an amide. This rules out **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide** and further confirms the elimination of **D)**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow we can use the detailed ¹H NMR data to confirm the structure and distinguish between the remaining possibilities.\n\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the unmistakable signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the molecule results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each splitting the other into a doublet. This rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which has a 1,3 (meta) substitution pattern that would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This triplet-quartet combination is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an ester: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) group, confirming the IR data.\n\n### **4. Assemble the Final Structure**\n\nLet's put all the identified pieces together:\n1.  A **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  A **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n3.  An **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** group.\n\nAttaching these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect (meta substitution, amide not ester).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This isomer's structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. In this case, the ethyl group's -CH₂- protons are adjacent to the carbonyl group, not the oxygen atom. Their chemical shift would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure (H₂N-C₆H₄-CO-O-CH₂CH₃) is perfectly consistent with all data: the correct formula and DoU, the IR signatures for a primary amine and conjugated ester, and all ¹H NMR signals (para-substituted ring, ethyl ester with a quartet at 4.5 ppm, and primary amine protons).\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect (secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester).\n\nAll evidence conclusively points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis to solve the structure elucidation problem. All candidate answers follow this same logical path, confirming the reasoning is sound. The only discrepancies are in the final letter choices, which stems from the randomization of the option labels, not from a disagreement on the chemical identity of the compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in the 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ range is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out secondary amines (which would have one band) and tertiary amines (no N-H bands).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of an **ester C=O group**, especially one conjugated with a benzene ring. Amide carbonyls typically appear at a lower frequency (e.g., < 1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet represents the methyl protons split by the two methylene protons, and the quartet represents the methylene protons split by the three methyl protons. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is crucial; it indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of an ester (-CO**O**CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. Broadening is typical for exchangeable protons on nitrogen.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group, and the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAssembling the fragments identified from the spectra gives a single unambiguous structure: a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Matching to the Options\n\nReferring to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The ethyl group is not attached to the ester oxygen.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. The compound is meta-substituted and is an amide, not an ester.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. The compound is a secondary amide.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which tells us the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Conclusion**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of two oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately points away from options containing secondary amines (like option D).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one that is conjugated with the aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the typical ~1735-1750 cm⁻¹). This frequency is generally too high for an amide (like options C and D), which typically appears at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). This rules out option C, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The critical piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This high, downfield value means the -CH₂- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of an ester or ether. In the context of an ester (-COOR), this indicates an ethyl group attached to the oxygen (**-O-CH₂CH₃**).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadening is due to exchange and the electrical quadrupole of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nAssembling these pieces can only result in **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options provided.\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all pieces of spectral data. It has the correct molecular formula, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a para-substituted ring with the expected electronic effects reflected in the NMR.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This is an isomer where the structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. In this case, the NMR quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the ester oxygen, and would appear at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), which contradicts the observed spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is a primary amide, not an ester (contradicts IR), and it is meta-substituted (contradicts NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine (contradicts IR).\n\nAll candidate analyses correctly reason that the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The correct choice is therefore option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using provided IR and 1H NMR spectroscopic data. The analysis proceeds by interpreting each piece of data to deduce structural fragments and then assembling them into the final molecule.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated to determine the number of rings and pi-bonds:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands of medium-to-strong intensity in this region are the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). They correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This eliminates option C, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester group conjugated with a benzene ring. Amides (options C and D) generally absorb at lower frequencies (e.g., ~1650-1690 cm⁻¹). Therefore, the compound is likely a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The triplet represents the methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the methylene group, and the quartet represents the methylene (-CH₂-) group adjacent to the methyl group. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃). This piece of data rules out option A (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the ethyl group's methylene quartet would be next to a carbonyl (C=O) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the amine (-NH₂) protons, confirming the deduction from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This rules out option D (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would produce a more complex splitting pattern. The significant chemical shift difference between the doublets confirms that one substituent is electron-donating (the amine group, shifting ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and one is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, shifting ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll spectral data consistently point to a structure with a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. This combination uniquely identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Option A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect NMR shift for the ethyl group.\n*   **Option B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n*   **Option C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect functional group (secondary amide) and NMR would have a formyl proton.\n*   **Option D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect functional group (amide) and substitution pattern (meta).\n\nThe correct answer is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the provided spectroscopic data leads to a conclusive identification of the unknown compound, C9H11NO2. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 11/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (the remaining degree), which is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately rules out option C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl region. This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (R-COO-R'). The conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ of a saturated ester. An amide carbonyl (options A and C) would typically absorb at a lower frequency (e.g., ~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial: it indicates that the -CH₂- group is directly bonded to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃) which, combined with the ester functional group from the IR, forms an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This piece of data rules out option D, 4-aminophenyl propionate (H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂CH₃**), where the CH₂ quartet would be adjacent to the carbonyl and appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is characteristic of the -NH₂ protons of a primary amine, confirming the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is the signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic properties. This symmetrical pattern rules out option A, 3-ethoxybenzamide, which has a 1,3-(meta) substitution and would give a more complex splitting pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   The data confirms the presence of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   Putting these pieces together yields the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect (meta substitution, amide).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. It fits all the data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and para-substituted ring.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect (NMR for ethyl group does not match).\n\nThe compound is unequivocally ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator for a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond (1 degree), which is very likely a carbonyl (C=O) group given the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, strong bands in this region are a definitive sign of a primary amine (-NH₂). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This piece of data rules out any structures that have secondary amines or amides with no N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester group, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the usual ~1735-1750 cm⁻¹). This frequency is generally too high for an amide group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the unmistakable pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The separation of the signals indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (pushing the adjacent protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (pulling the adjacent protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The signal at 1.20 ppm is a triplet (t) for 3 hydrogens (-CH₃ next to a -CH₂-). The signal at 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) for 2 hydrogens (-CH₂- next to a -CH₃). This combination confirms an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). Crucially, the downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene group is directly attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH₂CH₃), consistent with an ethyl ester.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet (bs) for 2 hydrogens at 4.0 ppm is characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH₂), which confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4. Assemble the Pieces and Evaluate Options:**\n*   The data indicates a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The substituents are a **primary amine (-NH₂)** (an electron-donating group) and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** (an electron-withdrawing group).\n*   Putting these fragments together results in **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   This structure fits all data points: the molecular formula is correct, the IR shows a primary amine and a conjugated ester, and the ¹H NMR shows the para-disubstituted ring, the ethyl ester, and the amine protons with the correct chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\n\n**Checking the Options:**\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This is a perfect match for the derived structure.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, contradicting the IR data (which shows a primary amine).\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a different NMR aromatic pattern, and it is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR carbonyl frequency.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). In this structure, the NMR signal for the CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThe analysis of all provided spectral data leads unequivocally to the identification of the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct structure based on the provided spectral data. All 15 candidate agents followed a similar and correct logical pathway, with the unanimous conclusion being that the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The only discrepancies among the agents were the final letter choices, which was due to the options being listed in a different order for each.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The calculation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2). For this formula, DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of oxygen. This point was agreed upon by all agents.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out any structure with a secondary or tertiary amine.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. The value is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which would be < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains both a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial clue is the quartet's chemical shift at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, which confirms it is bonded to the oxygen of the ester group (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (-NH₂) and the other is electron-withdrawing (-COOCH₂CH₃), which accounts for the upfield and downfield shifts, respectively.\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options\n*   **Identified Fragments:** The spectra have conclusively identified: (1) a primary amine group, (2) an ethyl ester group, and (3) a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring to which they are attached.\n*   **Assembly:** Putting these fragments together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectroscopic evidence.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the primary amine data.\n    *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted (not para) and an amide (not an ester), both of which are inconsistent with the data.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the quartet for the -CH₂- of the ethyl group would be around 2.5-3.0 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm (next to O-R).\n\nThe analysis of all data points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"

For C9H11NO2, this is 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O). This is a point of universal agreement among all the candidate analyses.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** All analyses correctly identify these two distinct, medium-to-strong bands as the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This is due to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This key piece of evidence rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** All analyses correctly identify this strong band as a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency (e.g., ~1680 cm⁻¹).\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** There is universal agreement that this triplet-quartet pair is the definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. Critically, the very high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of the ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** All analyses correctly assign this broad singlet, which integrates to two protons, to the protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is universally and correctly identified as the hallmark pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (like -NH₂) and the other is electron-withdrawing (like -COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options\n*   The data from all three techniques consistently points to a single structure: a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n*   This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Now, we match this structure to the given options:\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide - Incorrect (meta-substitution, amide, not ester).\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate - Incorrect (the quartet for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm).\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate - Correct. This structure perfectly matches all of the provided data.**\n    *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide - Incorrect (secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester).\n\n### Conclusion\nAll fifteen candidate answers correctly identified the structure as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through their chemical reasoning. Any discrepancies in their final letters were due to clerical errors in mapping the correct structure to the corresponding letter option. The correct structure, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires identifying an unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 based on its Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra. All candidate analyses follow a similar, correct, step-by-step approach.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two distinct bands are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH2)**, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. The value is too high for a typical conjugated amide (which would be < 1700 cm-1).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The triplet is the -CH3 group, and the quartet is the -CH2- group. The high chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH2)** protons. The signal is broad due to proton exchange and coupling to the nitrogen nucleus.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n\n**4. Structure Assembly and Verification:**\n*   **Fragments:** The spectra reveal three key pieces: (1) a para-disubstituted benzene ring, (2) a primary amine group (-NH2), and (3) an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Assembly:** Placing these fragments together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   **Verification:** This structure is fully consistent with all data. The primary amine is an electron-donating group, which shields its ortho-protons, corresponding to the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm. The ethyl ester is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields its ortho-protons, corresponding to the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm. The structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options:**\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (-CO-CH2CH3), not an ethoxy group. The -CH2- quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide (inconsistent with IR C=O frequency) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent with NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Perfectly matches all spectroscopic evidence.\n\nAll candidate agents correctly identify the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate through sound reasoning. The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to be from inconsistent re-labeling of the options within their reasoning process. Based on the original prompt's list, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectral data, here is the reasoning to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three pi bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are a definitive signature for a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This rules out any structure with a secondary amine or amide (like option D).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is characteristic of an ester C=O stretch that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (options A and D), which usually appears below 1700 cm-1.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen atom of an ester (-CO-O-CH2CH3). This rules out option B (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the CH2 group of the ethyl chain is attached to the carbonyl (C=O) and would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2), confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This rules out option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would give a more complex pattern. The two different chemical shifts indicate one substituent is electron-donating (the -NH2 group, shielding its ortho protons to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, deshielding its ortho protons to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combined data points unequivocally to a structure with:\n*   A 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH2) substituent.\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) substituent.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which corresponds to option C.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect (meta substitution, amide not ester).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect (NMR chemical shift for the ethyl group would be different).\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Perfect match for all data.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect (secondary amide, not primary amine and ester).\n\nAll provided candidate analyses, despite some confusion with the final letter designations, reach the same conclusion through sound chemical reasoning: the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a spectroscopic puzzle. The goal is to determine the correct structure of C9H11NO2 from four possible options using the provided IR and 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three pi bonds) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two distinct bands are the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2), corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This points to a structure with an -NH2 group.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is in the range of a conjugated ester. It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a simple alkyl ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), but fits perfectly for an ester conjugated to a benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group (-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2), confirming the IR analysis. Broadness is expected due to nitrogen's properties and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The separation in their chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, shielding its ortho protons (the signal at 7.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, deshielding its ortho protons (the signal at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Conclusion by Assembling the Pieces**\n\nThe evidence from all spectra points to a single structure:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is meta-substituted and an amide, inconsistent with the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR carbonyl frequency.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the NMR signal for the -CH2- of the ethyl group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the oxygen, and would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the comprehensive analyses provided, a step-by-step logical deduction leads to the identification of the unknown compound. Here is a breakdown of the key points derived from the consensus of the candidate answers:\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula C9H11NO2 gives a Degree of Unsaturation of 5.\n*   This is a strong indication of a benzene ring (DoU = 4) plus one additional double bond (DoU = 1), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum:**\n*   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out any structure with a secondary or tertiary amine.\n*   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. Its specific frequency suggests it is from a conjugated **ester**, not an amide (which would typically be at a lower frequency, <1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   The combination of a triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** and a quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)** is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) proves that the -CH₂- group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the ester oxygen (-CO-**O**-CH₂CH₃). This single point is crucial for distinguishing between isomers.\n*   The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm (2H)** confirms the presence of the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which supports the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   The two doublets at **7.0 ppm (2H)** and **8.0 ppm (2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (causing an upfield shift) and the other is electron-withdrawing (causing a downfield shift).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Final Verification:**\n*   The identified fragments are: a primary amine (-NH₂), an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   Assembling these pieces results in **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data. The electron-donating -NH₂ group accounts for the upfield aromatic doublet (~7.0 ppm), and the electron-withdrawing ester group accounts for the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm).\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the NMR signal for the ethyl's -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with the IR carbonyl frequency and the NMR aromatic pattern.\n\nThe conclusion from all candidate answers is unanimous and well-supported: the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl (C=O) group, given the two oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the typical ~1735 cm-1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This coupled triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of an ester, forming an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** as part of an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons in this region is characteristic of the protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** identified from the IR data. The broadness is caused by quadrupole coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in their chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding protons, moving them upfield) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding protons, moving them downfield).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Verify**\n    *   The fragments we've identified are: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Assembling these pieces leads to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check the structure against the NMR data. The amino group (-NH2) is electron-donating, so it would shield its ortho protons, causing them to appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield). This matches the signal at **7.0 ppm**. The ester group (-COOCH2CH3) is electron-withdrawing, so it would deshield its ortho protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). This matches the signal at **8.0 ppm**. The structure is a perfect fit for all the data.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of a propionyl chain (-CO-CH2CH3). The quartet for this -CH2- would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data showing a primary amine. Incorrect.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted (1,3-) compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis of the formula, IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum consistently and unambiguously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The first step is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) or Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). This tells us the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This key piece of evidence rules out any compound with a secondary amine (which would only have one N-H band, like option D) or a tertiary amine (which would have no N-H bands).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester** functional group, specifically one that is conjugated with a double bond or aromatic ring. An amide C=O group (options B and D) would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹). This strongly favors an ester structure.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet represents the methyl (-CH₃) protons being split by the two methylene (-CH₂-) protons. The quartet represents the methylene protons being split by the three methyl protons. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is crucial; it indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which, given the IR data pointing to an ester, is almost certainly the ester oxygen atom (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This chemical shift and shape are characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus. This confirms the conclusion drawn from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shift indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n    *   The data clearly identifies three structural fragments:\n        1.  A primary amine group (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n        2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n        3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n    *   Combining these pieces leads directly to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this conclusion against the options:\n        *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this structure, the ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl (C=O), and its -CH₂- signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a *meta*-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern. It is also an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n        *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectroscopic evidence: the molecular formula, the primary amine and ester IR bands, and all NMR signals (ethyl group, primary amine protons, and para-substituted ring pattern with appropriate electronic effects).\n        *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data indicating a primary amine.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry structure elucidation problem. To identify the correct compound, we need to systematically analyze each piece of spectroscopic data and see which of the candidate structures fits all the data points.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the hallmark of a **primary amine (-NH2)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This eliminates option A (a secondary amide) which would show only one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide (like in option D), which would absorb at a lower frequency (closer to 1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The triplet represents the -CH3 group, and the quartet represents the adjacent -CH2- group. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which confirms it's bonded to an oxygen, as in an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**. This is a crucial point that helps distinguish between ester isomers.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the -NH2 protons of the primary amine. The signal is broad due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This pattern eliminates option D (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would produce a more complex splitting pattern. The significant chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (e.g., -NH2), which shields the adjacent protons (upfield signal at 7.0 ppm), and the other is electron-withdrawing (e.g., -COOCH2CH3), which deshields the adjacent protons (downfield signal at 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   The data clearly points to a structure containing a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). This assembly corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. It's a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all data points: the formula, the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, the para-disubstituted ring, and the specific NMR chemical shifts.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer (H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3). In this structure, the quartet of the ethyl group would be adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, not the ester oxygen, and would have a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. It is an amide (inconsistent with the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR band) and is meta-substituted (inconsistent with the para-splitting pattern in the NMR).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to understand the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond (the 5th DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity):** The presence of two distinct absorption bands in this region is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester**, specifically one whose carbonyl group is conjugated with a benzene ring. This frequency is generally too high for an amide.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is a definitive signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) is the -CH₃ group, split by its two neighboring protons.\n    *   The quartet (q) is the -CH₂ group, split by its three neighboring protons.\n    *   The significant downfield shift of the quartet to **4.5 ppm** indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen atom in an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the compound is an **ethyl ester**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift and characteristic broadness (due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and hydrogen exchange) confirm the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The significant chemical shift difference between the doublets confirms that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) while the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nWe have identified the following fragments:\n1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together yields only one possible structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is also consistent with the electronic effects seen in the NMR: the protons ortho to the electron-donating amine appear upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted, inconsistent with the para-substituted NMR pattern. It is also an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all pieces of spectral data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acid component (propionyl group). The -CH₂- of the ethyl group would be next to a C=O, giving a signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThe spectral data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the spectroscopic problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which tells us the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   **Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n### **2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively. This fact immediately rules out any structure that does not contain a primary amine, such as option **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which has a secondary amide (-NH-).\n*   **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency helps identify the functional group type:\n    *   Amides (like options A and D) typically show a C=O stretch at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Esters typically show a C=O stretch around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹. Conjugation with a benzene ring lowers this frequency to the observed range (~1715-1730 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Therefore, the band at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests a **conjugated ester**, not an amide. This rules out **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide** and further confirms the elimination of **D)**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow we can use the detailed ¹H NMR data to confirm the structure and distinguish between the remaining possibilities.\n\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the unmistakable signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the molecule results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each splitting the other into a doublet. This rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which has a 1,3 (meta) substitution pattern that would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This triplet-quartet combination is the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. A methylene group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an ester: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) group, confirming the IR data.\n\n### **4. Assemble the Final Structure**\n\nLet's put all the identified pieces together:\n1.  A **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  A **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n3.  An **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** group.\n\nAttaching these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect (meta substitution, amide not ester).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This isomer's structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. In this case, the ethyl group's -CH₂- protons are adjacent to the carbonyl group, not the oxygen atom. Their chemical shift would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure (H₂N-C₆H₄-CO-O-CH₂CH₃) is perfectly consistent with all data: the correct formula and DoU, the IR signatures for a primary amine and conjugated ester, and all ¹H NMR signals (para-substituted ring, ethyl ester with a quartet at 4.5 ppm, and primary amine protons).\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect (secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester).\n\nAll evidence conclusively points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis to solve the structure elucidation problem. All candidate answers follow this same logical path, confirming the reasoning is sound. The only discrepancies are in the final letter choices, which stems from the randomization of the option labels, not from a disagreement on the chemical identity of the compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = **5**.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in the 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ range is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out secondary amines (which would have one band) and tertiary amines (no N-H bands).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of an **ester C=O group**, especially one conjugated with a benzene ring. Amide carbonyls typically appear at a lower frequency (e.g., < 1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet represents the methyl protons split by the two methylene protons, and the quartet represents the methylene protons split by the three methyl protons. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is crucial; it indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of an ester (-CO**O**CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. Broadening is typical for exchangeable protons on nitrogen.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group, and the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAssembling the fragments identified from the spectra gives a single unambiguous structure: a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Matching to the Options\n\nReferring to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The ethyl group is not attached to the ester oxygen.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. The compound is meta-substituted and is an amide, not an ester.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. The compound is a secondary amide.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   First, calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which tells us the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Conclusion**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of two oxygen atoms and the IR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately points away from options containing secondary amines (like option D).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly one that is conjugated with the aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the typical ~1735-1750 cm⁻¹). This frequency is generally too high for an amide (like options C and D), which typically appears at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). This rules out option C, which is meta-substituted.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The critical piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm**. This high, downfield value means the -CH₂- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which must be the oxygen of an ester or ether. In the context of an ester (-COOR), this indicates an ethyl group attached to the oxygen (**-O-CH₂CH₃**).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadening is due to exchange and the electrical quadrupole of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂), which is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nAssembling these pieces can only result in **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options provided.\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all pieces of spectral data. It has the correct molecular formula, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a para-substituted ring with the expected electronic effects reflected in the NMR.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This is an isomer where the structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. In this case, the NMR quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the ester oxygen, and would appear at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.5 ppm), which contradicts the observed spectrum.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is a primary amide, not an ester (contradicts IR), and it is meta-substituted (contradicts NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine (contradicts IR).\n\nAll candidate analyses correctly reason that the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The correct choice is therefore option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using provided IR and 1H NMR spectroscopic data. The analysis proceeds by interpreting each piece of data to deduce structural fragments and then assembling them into the final molecule.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated to determine the number of rings and pi-bonds:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands of medium-to-strong intensity in this region are the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). They correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This eliminates option C, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester group conjugated with a benzene ring. Amides (options C and D) generally absorb at lower frequencies (e.g., ~1650-1690 cm⁻¹). Therefore, the compound is likely a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The triplet represents the methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the methylene group, and the quartet represents the methylene (-CH₂-) group adjacent to the methyl group. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃). This piece of data rules out option A (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the ethyl group's methylene quartet would be next to a carbonyl (C=O) and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the amine (-NH₂) protons, confirming the deduction from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This rules out option D (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 1,3- (meta) substituted and would produce a more complex splitting pattern. The significant chemical shift difference between the doublets confirms that one substituent is electron-donating (the amine group, shifting ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and one is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, shifting ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll spectral data consistently point to a structure with a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. This combination uniquely identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Option A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect NMR shift for the ethyl group.\n*   **Option B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n*   **Option C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect functional group (secondary amide) and NMR would have a formyl proton.\n*   **Option D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect functional group (amide) and substitution pattern (meta).\n\nThe correct answer is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the provided spectroscopic data leads to a conclusive identification of the unknown compound, C9H11NO2. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 11/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (the remaining degree), which is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the IR data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately rules out option C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl region. This frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (R-COO-R'). The conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ of a saturated ester. An amide carbonyl (options A and C) would typically absorb at a lower frequency (e.g., ~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial: it indicates that the -CH₂- group is directly bonded to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃) which, combined with the ester functional group from the IR, forms an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This piece of data rules out option D, 4-aminophenyl propionate (H₂N-Ph-O-CO-**CH₂CH₃**), where the CH₂ quartet would be adjacent to the carbonyl and appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is characteristic of the -NH₂ protons of a primary amine, confirming the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is the signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic properties. This symmetrical pattern rules out option A, 3-ethoxybenzamide, which has a 1,3-(meta) substitution and would give a more complex splitting pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   The data confirms the presence of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   Putting these pieces together yields the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect (meta substitution, amide).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. It fits all the data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and para-substituted ring.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect (NMR for ethyl group does not match).\n\nThe compound is unequivocally ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator for a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond (1 degree), which is very likely a carbonyl (C=O) group given the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, strong bands in this region are a definitive sign of a primary amine (-NH₂). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This piece of data rules out any structures that have secondary amines or amides with no N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester group, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the usual ~1735-1750 cm⁻¹). This frequency is generally too high for an amide group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the unmistakable pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The separation of the signals indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (pushing the adjacent protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (pulling the adjacent protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** The signal at 1.20 ppm is a triplet (t) for 3 hydrogens (-CH₃ next to a -CH₂-). The signal at 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) for 2 hydrogens (-CH₂- next to a -CH₃). This combination confirms an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). Crucially, the downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene group is directly attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH₂CH₃), consistent with an ethyl ester.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet (bs) for 2 hydrogens at 4.0 ppm is characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH₂), which confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n\n**4. Assemble the Pieces and Evaluate Options:**\n*   The data indicates a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The substituents are a **primary amine (-NH₂)** (an electron-donating group) and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** (an electron-withdrawing group).\n*   Putting these fragments together results in **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   This structure fits all data points: the molecular formula is correct, the IR shows a primary amine and a conjugated ester, and the ¹H NMR shows the para-disubstituted ring, the ethyl ester, and the amine protons with the correct chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\n\n**Checking the Options:**\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This is a perfect match for the derived structure.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, contradicting the IR data (which shows a primary amine).\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a different NMR aromatic pattern, and it is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR carbonyl frequency.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). In this structure, the NMR signal for the CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThe analysis of all provided spectral data leads unequivocally to the identification of the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
