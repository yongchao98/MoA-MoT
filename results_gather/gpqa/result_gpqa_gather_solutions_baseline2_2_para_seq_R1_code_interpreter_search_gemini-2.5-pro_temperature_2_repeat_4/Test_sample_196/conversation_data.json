The frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data unanimously points to Compound X being an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, a broad singlet located far downfield, is a classic sign of the acidic proton in a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This confirms the IR interpretation.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet integrating to two protons, are a clear indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm doublet means these protons are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other, electron-donating alkyl substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals define the alkyl group's structure.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH- group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2H, consistent with the -CH₂- group adjacent to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine proton at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1H. Its downfield shift indicates it's a benzylic proton (on the carbon attached to the ring). It's the -CH- group, coupled to the adjacent methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The fragments `CH₃CH₂-` and `CH₃CH-` connect at the benzylic methine (-CH-) and the methylene (-CH₂-) carbons. This forms a `Ring-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)` structure. This is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (A) in the list.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n2.  **Reagent Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and saturated alkyl groups (like sec-butyl) are stable under these conditions and do not react.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group remains unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options\n\nLet's examine the options again:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid — This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid — Incorrect structure.\n*   C) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** — This matches our deduced final product.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene — Incorrect alkyl isomer. The starting material has a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nAll candidate answers follow a consistent and correct line of reasoning to identify Compound X from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a definitive peak for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong C=O stretch, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ & 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield confirms the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) & 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinct pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The signals at 0.9, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.9 ppm must be assembled into a single alkyl group.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` and `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` together form an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) attached to a single proton (a methine).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is the methine proton (`-CH-`) attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   Assembling these pieces onto the benzylic carbon (the methine) gives `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all deductions, the starting material is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B) in the list.\n\n**Part 2: Determine the Final Product of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction will convert the -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into a -CH₃ group, leaving the stable aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group untouched.\n*   **Final Product:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is converted to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**. Looking at the provided options:\nA) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer.\nB) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the product.\nC) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\nD) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, consolidating the reasoning from the candidate answers:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X.**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive feature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which forms hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is in the correct range for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** is a broad singlet very far downfield, which is the classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   The signals at **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of this substitution pattern. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) because they are adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The remaining signals must describe the second substituent on the ring. We can piece together its structure:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This indicates an ethyl fragment starter: `-CH₂CH₃`.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (it is a benzylic proton).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments `-CH(CH₃)` and `-CH₂CH₃` are connected. The benzylic carbon is the methine (-CH-), so the full group attached to the ring is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, which is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (C), which is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the chemical reaction.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is performed with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. Its most notable function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the existing saturated alkyl group (sec-butyl) are not affected by this reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a -CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Product:** The resulting molecule has a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4 on the benzene ring.\n*   The IUPAC name of the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This perfectly matches the predicted final product.\n*   B) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   C) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   D) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure is inconsistent with the starting material and the reaction.\n\nThe correct final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X.**\n\n1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   The very broad peak from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive indicator of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid conjugated with a benzene ring.\n    *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of C=C bonds in an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n    *   The two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** in the aromatic region are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and verifying the conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first step is to decipher the structure of the reactant, Compound X, from its IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a highly characteristic, very broad absorption that indicates the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer. This is a very strong piece of evidence for a -COOH group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp absorption corresponding to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These are characteristic C=C bond stretches, confirming the presence of an aromatic (benzene) ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, located very far downfield, is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**), which perfectly confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet representing two protons, are a definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to the second substituent.\n    *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group:** The remaining signals describe the second substituent attached to the ring. We can piece together its structure:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H signifies a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment starter.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H signifies a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1H. Its downfield shift is characteristic of a benzylic proton (a proton on the carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This must be the methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂-) group of the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to both a methyl group and a methine group, hence its complex multiplet appearance.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-), which is attached to both a methyl group and an ethyl group. The complete substituent is **-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)**, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Final Structure of Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C), but it is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Identify the Final Product**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and HI** (hydriodic acid).\n*   **Function of Reagents:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to perform a complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the existing saturated sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and remain unchanged.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe task is to find the option that matches the final product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This exactly matches the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This has the wrong alkyl isomer. The sec-butyl group does not rearrange into an isobutyl group in this reaction.\n*   **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, a common distractor in multi-step problems.\n*   **D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is an entirely different molecular structure.\n\nThe chemical reasoning consistently leads to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This confirms the IR interpretation.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet integrating to two protons, are a clear indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm doublet means these protons are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other, electron-donating alkyl substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals define the alkyl group's structure.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH- group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2H, consistent with the -CH₂- group adjacent to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine proton at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1H.

It's the -CH- group, coupled to the adjacent methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The fragments `CH₃CH₂-` and `CH₃CH-` connect at the benzylic methine (-CH-) and the methylene (-CH₂-) carbons. This forms a `Ring-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)` structure. This is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Based on the correct chemical reasoning, the answer must correspond to the correct structure in the original list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Analysis of the problem-solving process:**\n\n1.  **Structure Determination of the Starting Material (Compound X):**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** All candidate answers correctly interpret the IR spectrum. The very broad peak at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and the strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) are definitive for a carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate an aromatic ring. The unanimous conclusion is that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** All candidates correctly identify the two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) as a signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm signal correctly places it ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n        *   **Carboxylic Acid Proton:** The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is unanimously identified as the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n        *   **Alkyl Group:** All candidates correctly assemble the alkyl group from the remaining signals. The fragments -CH₂CH₃ (from the triplet at 0.9 ppm and multiplet at 1.7 ppm) and -CH(CH₃)- (from the doublet at 1.4 ppm) are correctly connected via the benzylic methine proton (-CH-) at 2.9 ppm. This forms a **sec-butyl group**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** There is a strong consensus that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Transformation:** There is a unanimous agreement that this combination is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unaffected.\n\n3.  **Final Product Determination:**\n    *   Starting with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the reduction of the -COOH group leads to the final product **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals (0.9, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.9 ppm) describe the alkyl substituent. By analyzing the integration, chemical shifts, and splitting patterns (triplet, doublet, multiplet, multiplet), all agents correctly assemble the alkyl group as -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The molecule is a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group.

This matches option (C).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and the Product:**\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). The saturated alkyl side chain (sec-butyl) and the aromatic ring are unaffected.\n    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Final Product Structure:** The product will be a benzene ring substituted with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement. The name is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n3.  **Match the Product with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This matches the predicted final product.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is an isobutyl isomer, which is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\nThe correct final answer is the structure of the product formed from the reaction, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is part of a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is a typical value for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The consensus is that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is definitive proof of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinct pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield because its protons are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, with its protons ortho to the second substituent, which must be an alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals are used to piece together the structure of the alkyl group:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons represents the methylene group (-CH₂-). It is adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm, causing a complex splitting pattern.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton represents the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield chemical shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic position).\n    *   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:** By combining the fragments, the substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. Thus, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound X is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent system. All candidate answers correctly identify that it is used to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and do not react.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n**Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\nThe structure determined for the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Let's compare this to the options:\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This has an incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **This matches the predicted final product.**\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nThe final answer is therefore C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
