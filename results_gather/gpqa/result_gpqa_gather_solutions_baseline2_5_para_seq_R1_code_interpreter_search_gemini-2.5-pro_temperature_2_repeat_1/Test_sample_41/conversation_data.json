This means calculating the ratio P₃/P₁. The problem provides information about mass ratios and a specific albedo value, which are extraneous.\n    *   **Mass Ratios & TTV Method:** This information is context about how the planets were discovered and their masses inferred but is not used in the application of Kepler's Third Law for this question, where planetary masses are assumed negligible compared to the star's mass.\n    *   **Albedo Value (0.3):** The specific value is not needed. The crucial piece of information is that the albedo is the *same* for all three planets, which means the albedo term cancels out when calculating temperature or distance ratios.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Physical Principles**\n    The solution requires the application and combination of two fundamental laws of planetary physics for planets orbiting the same star:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance ($a$) from its star.\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its orbital distance ($a$).\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$, which implies $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n3.  **Synthesize a Direct Relationship between Period and Temperature**\n    The most efficient path to the solution is to combine the two principles to eliminate the intermediate variable of orbital distance ($a$).\n    *   From the temperature law, solve for distance: $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$.\n    *   Substitute this expression for distance into Kepler's Law: $P \\propto (T_{eq}^{-2})^{3/2}$.\n    *   Simplify the exponent to get the final, direct relationship: $P \\propto T_{eq}^{-3}$.\n    This powerful result shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio we need to calculate is:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}})^3$\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the overall temperature ratio ($T_{eq,1}/T_{eq,3}$)**.

A key skill tested in this problem is the ability to recognize and discard extraneous information. As all the candidate answers correctly identified, the given mass ratios and the specific albedo value (0.3) are irrelevant for this calculation.\n    *   **Mass Ratios**: Kepler's Third Law in its simplified form (used here) assumes the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the star's mass.

This is the ratio P₃/P₁. The information regarding the planets' mass ratios and the specific albedo value (0.3) is extraneous.\n    *   **Mass Ratios:** Kepler's Third Law in its simple form ($P^2 \\propto a^3$) is used here, which assumes planetary masses are negligible compared to their host star. The TTV method of discovery relies on mass interactions, but this information is a distractor for calculating the period-distance relationship itself.\n    *   **Albedo Value:** The specific value of 0.3 is irrelevant. The crucial detail is that the albedo is the *same* for all planets, which causes this term to cancel out when calculating ratios of equilibrium temperatures.\n\n2.  **Establish the Governing Physical Principles:** The solution requires combining two fundamental laws of planetary physics:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** For a planet in a stable orbit, its equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance ($a$) from its star. This relationship is written as:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** A planet's orbital period ($P$) is related to its semi-major axis (orbital distance, $a$) by the proportionality $P \\propto a^{3/2}$.\n\n3.  **Combine the Principles into a Direct Relationship:** The most efficient method is to create a single relationship between the orbital period ($P$) and the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$), eliminating the orbital distance ($a$) as an intermediate variable.\n    *   From the temperature law, we can express the orbital distance as: $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$.\n    *   Now, we substitute this into Kepler's Law: $P \\propto a^{3/2} \\implies P \\propto (T_{eq}^{-2})^{3/2}$.\n    *   Simplifying the exponent gives the final, direct relationship: $P \\propto T_{eq}^{-3}$.\n    This powerful result shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Based on the derived relationship, the period ratio we need is $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}})^{3}$.\n    *   First, we must calculate the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3, $T_{eq,1}/T_{eq,3}$, by chaining the given ratios:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}} = \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n    *   Finally, we cube this temperature ratio to find the period ratio:\n        $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\n5.  **Match the Result to the Options:**\n    The calculated result, rounded to one decimal place, is **33.4**.

This means calculating the ratio P₃/P₁. The problem provides information about mass ratios and a specific albedo value, which are extraneous.\n    *   **Mass Ratios & TTV Method:** This information is context about how the planets were discovered and their masses inferred but is not used in the application of Kepler's Third Law for this question, where planetary masses are assumed negligible compared to the star's mass.\n    *   **Albedo Value (0.3):** The specific value is not needed. The crucial piece of information is that the albedo is the *same* for all three planets, which means the albedo term cancels out when calculating temperature or distance ratios.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Physical Principles**\n    The solution requires the application and combination of two fundamental laws of planetary physics for planets orbiting the same star:\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance ($a$) from its star.\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its orbital distance ($a$).\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$, which implies $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n3.  **Synthesize a Direct Relationship between Period and Temperature**\n    The most efficient path to the solution is to combine the two principles to eliminate the intermediate variable of orbital distance ($a$).\n    *   From the temperature law, solve for distance: $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$.\n    *   Substitute this expression for distance into Kepler's Law: $P \\propto (T_{eq}^{-2})^{3/2}$.\n    *   Simplify the exponent to get the final, direct relationship: $P \\propto T_{eq}^{-3}$.\n    This powerful result shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio we need to calculate is:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}})^3$\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the overall temperature ratio ($T_{eq,1}/T_{eq,3}$)**. This must be found by multiplying the given intermediate ratios:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}} = \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the final period ratio ($P_3/P_1$)**. Now, cube the result from Step A:\n        $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\n5.  **Match Result to the Options**\n    The calculated result, rounded to one decimal place, is **33.4**.

A key skill tested in this problem is the ability to recognize and discard extraneous information. As all the candidate answers correctly identified, the given mass ratios and the specific albedo value (0.3) are irrelevant for this calculation.\n    *   **Mass Ratios**: Kepler's Third Law in its simplified form (used here) assumes the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the star's mass.
