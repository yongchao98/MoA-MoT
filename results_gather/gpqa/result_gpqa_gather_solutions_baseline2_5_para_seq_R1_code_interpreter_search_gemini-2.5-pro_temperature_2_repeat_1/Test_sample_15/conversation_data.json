The core principle for determining optical activity is whether a molecule is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and present in a non-racemic form. For this question, compounds named with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R, S, etc.) are considered pure stereoisomers.\n\nHere is a step-by-step evaluation based on the consensus reasoning:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbon-carbon double bond and all atoms directly attached to it. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration `(3aR, 7aS)` at two stereocenters. This indicates that a single, specific enantiomer of a complex chiral molecule is being considered. A pure enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) with identical substituents. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. Meso compounds contain chiral centers but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (such as a plane or center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks internal symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. The name specifies a single, pure enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a stereocenter because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and the two distinct paths around the ring due to the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is an achiral molecule. Its structure possesses at least one plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: A structural inspection shows no stereocenters. For instance, the carbon at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Final Tally**:\nBased on the unanimous analysis, there are three compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**.

A compound will be optically active if it is chiral and present in a form that is not a 50:50 racemic mixture. The IUPAC names provided, which often include stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), (Z), or (E), indicate that we should consider the specific stereoisomer mentioned.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the reasoning for each compound. Let's systematically review this consensus.\n\n**Analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: All agents correctly identify that this molecule is an alkene and that the plane containing the carbon-carbon double bond and its attached atoms constitutes a plane of symmetry. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: All agents correctly note that the IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule that is not a meso compound confirms its optical activity.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: All agents correctly identify this molecule as a *meso* compound. It contains two stereocenters with identical substituents, but the `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal element of symmetry (a center of inversion or plane of symmetry depending on conformation), making the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: All agents correctly identify this as a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: All agents correctly identify the carbon at position 1 as a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring containing the double bond. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: All agents correctly recognize this as a highly symmetrical molecule. Due to the 1,3,5 substitution pattern, it possesses planes of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: All agents correctly conclude this molecule is achiral because it has no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 of the butanone chain is attached to two identical methyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Final Tally:**\nThe analysis, which is unanimously supported by all candidate answers, shows that there are three optically active compounds in the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**.\n\nMatching this count to the provided options:\nA) 2\nB) 4\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of each compound for optical activity is required. The consensus from the candidate answers will be synthesized and verified.\n\n**Principle**: A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The question specifies particular stereoisomers, so we are considering them as pure substances, which are optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\nThe analysis provided by all candidate answers is remarkably consistent and correct.

Principle of Optical Activity**\n\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key factors to determine chirality are:\n*   **Presence of Chiral Centers:** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a common source of chirality.\n*   **Absence of Internal Symmetry:** The molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Meso Compounds:** Molecules with chiral centers but also an element of internal symmetry are achiral and thus optically inactive.\n*   **Specified Stereoisomers:** When a name includes descriptors like (R), (S), or other specific stereochemical notations, we assume we are evaluating a pure sample of that isomer, not a racemic (optically inactive) mixture.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound**\n\nThere is a complete and unanimous consensus across all candidate answers regarding the optical activity of each compound. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This alkene has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbon-carbon double bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically INACTIVE.**\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors (`3aR, 7aS`), indicating a single enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule. Such a pure enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically ACTIVE.**\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters, but with identical substituents.

The `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral because it lacks internal symmetry. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically ACTIVE.**\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring). It is a stereocenter. The `(R)` notation specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically ACTIVE.**\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This is a highly symmetrical molecule. Due to the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, it possesses a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically INACTIVE.**\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** A review of the structure reveals no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically INACTIVE.**\n\n**3. Final Tally**\n\nThe analysis confirms there are three optically active compounds in the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**.\n\n**4. Match with Options**\n\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) 4\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 2\n\nThe count of 3 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the reasoning for each compound. To reach the final answer, I will synthesize this reasoning and perform a definitive analysis.\n\n**Core Principle**\n\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it meets two criteria:\n1.  **Chirality**: The molecule must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is the absence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n2.  **Enantiomeric Form**: The compound must be present as a single enantiomer or in a non-racemic (unequal) mixture. When the name of a compound includes specific stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or (3aR, 7aS), it implies that a specific, pure stereoisomer is being considered, which fulfills this criterion if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond and the four atoms directly attached to them are coplanar. This plane acts as an internal plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex molecule, but the IUPAC name provides the necessary information. The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the exact configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral compound confirms its optical activity.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), and the substituents on both are identical. When such a molecule has opposite configurations at its two stereocenters (`R` and `S`), it is called a *meso* compound. Meso compounds contain chiral centers but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Because the two chiral centers have the same configuration (`R` and `R`), the molecule lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral pair.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) a hydroxyl group, 2) a hydrogen atom, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=`, and 4) the ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-`. Since the four groups are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The `(R)` notation specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the cyclohexane ring creates a high degree of symmetry. For instance, the all-cis isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is always achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of the molecular structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` shows no stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTallying the results, we find there are three optically active compounds in the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**. Matching this number with the provided options:\nA) 3\nB) 4\nC) 5\nD) 2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which of the listed compounds are chiral and are presented as a single stereoisomer (or a non-racemic mixture), as this is the condition for exhibiting optical activity. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The given names often specify a particular stereoisomer, implying a pure, optically active sample if the molecule is chiral.\n\nA careful step-by-step analysis of each compound, consistent across all candidate answers, yields the following conclusions:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: **Inactive**. This is an alkene where the atoms of the double bond and the atoms attached to them are coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule, rendering it achiral.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: **Active**. The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration `(3aR,7aS)` at two chiral centers in a complex, non-symmetrical molecule. This refers to a single enantiomer, which is by definition optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: **Inactive**. This molecule has two stereocenters with identical substituents. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes a *meso* compound. Meso compounds contain stereocenters but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: **Active**. This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral because it lacks an internal element of symmetry. The name specifies a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: **Active**. The carbon atom at position 1 is a stereocenter, as it is bonded to four different groups (`-H`, `-OH`, and two different paths around the ring). The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: **Inactive**. This is a symmetrically substituted cyclohexane that is achiral because it possesses at least one plane of symmetry.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: **Inactive**. A review of the molecule's structure shows no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral.\n\n**Final Count:**\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**. Matching this number with the given options:\nA) 4\nB) 5\nC) 2\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical principles and their application to each compound, even though the final letter choice varies due to differing option lists. The core task is to determine the correct number of optically active compounds based on this consensus reasoning.\n\n**Principle of Optical Activity:**\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The problem specifies particular stereoisomers (using R/S, Z/E, etc.), implying we should consider them as pure substances, which are optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound (based on unanimous agent consensus):**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Consensus**: Optically **inactive**.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This molecule is an alkene. The plane containing the `C=C` double bond and its attached atoms acts as an internal plane of symmetry, rendering the molecule achiral.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Consensus**: Optically **active**.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which specify a single enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule.

The core task is to determine how many of the seven listed chemical compounds are optically active.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Core Principle**: A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key factors to check for are:\n    *   **Chiral Centers (Stereocenters)**: A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: The molecule must lack internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n    *   **Meso Compounds**: These have chiral centers but are achiral overall due to internal symmetry. They are optically inactive.\n    *   **Specified Stereoisomers**: The problem provides names with stereochemical descriptors (like R, S, Z, E). This means we are considering a pure sample of a specific isomer, not a racemic (50:50) mixture. A pure sample of a chiral molecule will be optically active.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Compound**: I will go through each compound and apply the principles above. I will also note the consensus from the 15 candidate answers provided.\n\n    *   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the `C=C` double bond and the atoms directly attached lie in a single plane.

Analysis of Consensus**\n\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals an overwhelming and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning for each of the seven compounds. Every single answer concludes that there are exactly **3** optically active compounds on the list. While there are some minor discrepancies in how the final number is mapped to the multiple-choice letters (A, B, C, or D) due to different option listings in their source prompts, the underlying chemical analysis is identical and consistent across all agents.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Verification of Chirality**\n\nThe consensus reasoning is based on the fundamental principle that a compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Since the question specifies particular stereoisomers, we evaluate the chirality of these specific molecules.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene with a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=C` double bond. **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name specifies a single enantiomer `(3aR, 7aS)` of a complex chiral molecule. **Conclusion: Optically Active.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a *meso* compound.

It is a chiral molecule, and a specific enantiomer `(2R,3R)` is named. **Conclusion: Optically Active.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter (bonded to -H, -OH, and two different pathways around the ring). A specific enantiomer `(R)` is named. **Conclusion: Optically Active.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has a high degree of symmetry (including at least one plane of symmetry) and is therefore achiral. **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule has no stereocenters and is achiral. **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** (Unanimous agreement)\n\n**3. Final Tally**\n\nThe analysis confirms that there are three optically active compounds:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**.\n\n**4. Mapping to Options**\n\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 4\nD) 2\n\nThe correct count of 3 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (its mirror image is non-superimposable) and is present in a form that is not a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (i.e., not a racemic mixture). The IUPAC names provided, which include stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), (Z), or specify a particular isomer, indicate that we are considering a pure sample of that specific molecule. Therefore, the task simplifies to identifying which of the named molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule must lack an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them are all coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Any molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. This indicates a single enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule is being considered. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two identically substituted stereocenters. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes the *meso* form of the compound. Meso compounds have chiral centers but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (e.g., a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, an `-H` atom, and the two distinct paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=` versus `-CH=CH-CH2-`). This makes C1 a stereocenter. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. The 1,3,5 substitution pattern on the ring ensures that, regardless of the chair conformation, the molecule will have a plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-*cis* isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An inspection of the structure shows no stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups (`-CH(CH3)2`), so it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any chiral elements.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds determined to be optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.

The `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral because it lacks an internal symmetry element. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, a hydrogen atom, the path around the ring toward the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and the path around the ring away from the double bond (`-CH=CH-CH2-`). The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is achiral.

The molecule must be **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any internal symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n2.  The substance must be present in a **non-racemic** form (i.e., one enantiomer is in excess). The IUPAC names provided, which include stereochemical descriptors like `(R)`, `(S)`, `(3aR,7aS)`, etc., imply that we are considering a pure sample of a specific stereoisomer, thus fulfilling this condition if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\nThere is a complete consensus in the reasoning across all provided candidate answers.

A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. Key indicators for assessing chirality are:\n*   **Presence of stereocenters**: A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Absence of internal symmetry**: The molecule must lack a plane of symmetry (a plane that divides the molecule into two mirror-image halves) and a center of inversion (a point through which every atom can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side).\n*   **Meso Compounds**: These have stereocenters but are achiral due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Specified Stereoisomers**: The use of stereochemical descriptors like `(R)`, `(S)`, or naming a specific isomer implies we are evaluating a pure sample, which will be optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**2.

    "To determine the correct final answer, each of the seven compounds must be analyzed for optical activity. A compound is optically active if its molecular structure is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and it is present in a pure or enriched enantiomeric form. The use of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), etc., in the names implies that we are considering a specific, pure stereoisomer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This planarity creates an internal plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The IUPAC name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which define the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters in a complex, non-symmetrical molecule. The naming of a specific, single enantiomer implies the compound is chiral and in a pure form.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This specific enantiomer is chiral and thus **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) with identical substituents. When the configurations are opposite (`R` and `S`), it results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has an internal element of symmetry that makes it achiral, despite the presence of stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: As a meso compound, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. Because both stereocenters have the same configuration (`R` and `R`), the molecule lacks an internal element of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,2S) isomer. The name specifies a single, pure enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: As a pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 2) a hydrogen atom (-H), 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=`, and 4) the different ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-`. This makes C1 a stereocenter. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a pure enantiomer of a chiral molecule and is therefore **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical due to the 1,3,5 substitution pattern. This high degree of symmetry results in at least one plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Analysis**: An inspection of the structure `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2` reveals no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n### Final Tally:\nBased on the analysis, there are three compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**.\n\n### Matching with Options:\nThe options given in the question are:\nA) 2\nB) 3\nC) 5\nD) 4\n\nThe calculated count of 3 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Meso compounds contain chiral centers but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (such as a plane or center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks internal symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer.

A compound will be optically active if it is chiral and present in a form that is not a 50:50 racemic mixture. The IUPAC names provided, which often include stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), (Z), or (E), indicate that we should consider the specific stereoisomer mentioned.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the reasoning for each compound. Let's systematically review this consensus.\n\n**Analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: All agents correctly identify that this molecule is an alkene and that the plane containing the carbon-carbon double bond and its attached atoms constitutes a plane of symmetry. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: All agents correctly note that the IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule that is not a meso compound confirms its optical activity.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: All agents correctly identify this molecule as a *meso* compound. It contains two stereocenters with identical substituents, but the `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal element of symmetry (a center of inversion or plane of symmetry depending on conformation), making the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: All agents correctly identify this as a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: All agents correctly identify the carbon at position 1 as a stereocenter.

The consensus from the candidate answers will be synthesized and verified.\n\n**Principle**: A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral.

Principle of Optical Activity**\n\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Final Tally**\n\nThe analysis confirms there are three optically active compounds in the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**.\n\n**4. Match with Options**\n\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) 4\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 2\n\nThe count of 3 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the reasoning for each compound. To reach the final answer, I will synthesize this reasoning and perform a definitive analysis.\n\n**Core Principle**\n\nA compound will exhibit optical activity if it meets two criteria:\n1.  **Chirality**: The molecule must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature indicating chirality is the absence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n2.  **Enantiomeric Form**: The compound must be present as a single enantiomer or in a non-racemic (unequal) mixture. When the name of a compound includes specific stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or (3aR, 7aS), it implies that a specific, pure stereoisomer is being considered, which fulfills this criterion if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond and the four atoms directly attached to them are coplanar. This plane acts as an internal plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex molecule, but the IUPAC name provides the necessary information. The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the exact configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral compound confirms its optical activity.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), and the substituents on both are identical. When such a molecule has opposite configurations at its two stereocenters (`R` and `S`), it is called a *meso* compound. Meso compounds contain chiral centers but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. Because the two chiral centers have the same configuration (`R` and `R`), the molecule lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral pair.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) a hydroxyl group, 2) a hydrogen atom, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=`, and 4) the ring segment `-CH=CH-CH2-`. Since the four groups are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The `(R)` notation specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the cyclohexane ring creates a high degree of symmetry. For instance, the all-cis isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is always achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of the molecular structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` shows no stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **Inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTallying the results, we find there are three optically active compounds in the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**. Matching this number with the provided options:\nA) 3\nB) 4\nC) 5\nD) 2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which of the listed compounds are chiral and are presented as a single stereoisomer (or a non-racemic mixture), as this is the condition for exhibiting optical activity. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The given names often specify a particular stereoisomer, implying a pure, optically active sample if the molecule is chiral.\n\nA careful step-by-step analysis of each compound, consistent across all candidate answers, yields the following conclusions:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: **Inactive**. This is an alkene where the atoms of the double bond and the atoms attached to them are coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule, rendering it achiral.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: **Active**. The IUPAC name specifies the absolute configuration `(3aR,7aS)` at two chiral centers in a complex, non-symmetrical molecule. This refers to a single enantiomer, which is by definition optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: **Inactive**. This molecule has two stereocenters with identical substituents. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes a *meso* compound. Meso compounds contain stereocenters but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: **Active**. This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral because it lacks an internal element of symmetry. The name specifies a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: **Active**. The carbon atom at position 1 is a stereocenter, as it is bonded to four different groups (`-H`, `-OH`, and two different paths around the ring). The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: **Inactive**. This is a symmetrically substituted cyclohexane that is achiral because it possesses at least one plane of symmetry.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: **Inactive**.

The core task is to determine the correct number of optically active compounds based on this consensus reasoning.\n\n**Principle of Optical Activity:**\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The problem specifies particular stereoisomers (using R/S, Z/E, etc.), implying we should consider them as pure substances, which are optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound (based on unanimous agent consensus):**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Consensus**: Optically **inactive**.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This molecule is an alkene.

The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry, and a single enantiomer is specified.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Consensus**: Optically **active**.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The carbon at position 1 is a stereocenter (bonded to -H, -OH, and two different pathways around the ring). The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Consensus**: Optically **inactive**.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This molecule is highly symmetrical and possesses at least one plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Consensus**: Optically **inactive**.\n    *   **Reasoning**: An inspection of the structure reveals no chiral centers.

The core task is to determine how many of the seven listed chemical compounds are optically active.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Core Principle**: A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key factors to check for are:\n    *   **Chiral Centers (Stereocenters)**: A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: The molecule must lack internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n    *   **Meso Compounds**: These have chiral centers but are achiral overall due to internal symmetry. They are optically inactive.\n    *   **Specified Stereoisomers**: The problem provides names with stereochemical descriptors (like R, S, Z, E). This means we are considering a pure sample of a specific isomer, not a racemic (50:50) mixture. A pure sample of a chiral molecule will be optically active.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Compound**: I will go through each compound and apply the principles above. I will also note the consensus from the 15 candidate answers provided.\n\n    *   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the `C=C` double bond and the atoms directly attached lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry, making the molecule **achiral** and thus **optically inactive**.\n        *   **Agent Consensus**: All 15 answers agree this is inactive.\n\n    *   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name explicitly gives the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`.

The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound, which possesses internal symmetry. Meso compounds are **achiral** and therefore **optically inactive**.\n        *   **Agent Consensus**: All 15 answers agree this is inactive.\n\n    *   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks internal symmetry. It is a **chiral** molecule. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n        *   **Agent Consensus**: All 15 answers agree this is active.\n\n    *   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, a hydrogen atom, and the two different paths around the ring to the double bond (`-CH2-CH=` vs. `-CH=CH-CH2-`). It is a stereocenter. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer of this **chiral** molecule, making it **optically active**.\n        *   **Agent Consensus**: All 15 answers agree this is active.\n\n    *   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the cyclohexane ring creates a high degree of symmetry. This molecule possesses planes of symmetry and is therefore **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n        *   **Agent Consensus**: All 15 answers agree this is inactive.\n\n    *   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: Examining the structure shows no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule as a whole is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n        *   **Agent Consensus**: All 15 answers agree this is inactive.\n\n3.  **Final Tally and Conclusion**:\n    There is a unanimous consensus across all 15 provided answers, and the chemical principles support this conclusion.

Analysis of Consensus**\n\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals an overwhelming and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning for each of the seven compounds. Every single answer concludes that there are exactly **3** optically active compounds on the list. While there are some minor discrepancies in how the final number is mapped to the multiple-choice letters (A, B, C, or D) due to different option listings in their source prompts, the underlying chemical analysis is identical and consistent across all agents.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Verification of Chirality**\n\nThe consensus reasoning is based on the fundamental principle that a compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Since the question specifies particular stereoisomers, we evaluate the chirality of these specific molecules.\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene with a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=C` double bond. **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name specifies a single enantiomer `(3aR, 7aS)` of a complex chiral molecule. **Conclusion: Optically Active.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a *meso* compound. It has two identically substituted chiral centers with opposite configurations, which creates an internal symmetry element, making it achiral. **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. It is a chiral molecule, and a specific enantiomer `(2R,3R)` is named. **Conclusion: Optically Active.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter (bonded to -H, -OH, and two different pathways around the ring). A specific enantiomer `(R)` is named. **Conclusion: Optically Active.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has a high degree of symmetry (including at least one plane of symmetry) and is therefore achiral. **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** (Unanimous agreement)\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule has no stereocenters and is achiral. **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.** (Unanimous agreement)\n\n**3. Final Tally**\n\nThe analysis confirms that there are three optically active compounds:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**.\n\n**4. Mapping to Options**\n\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 4\nD) 2\n\nThe correct count of 3 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (its mirror image is non-superimposable) and is present in a form that is not a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (i.e., not a racemic mixture). The IUPAC names provided, which include stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), (Z), or specify a particular isomer, indicate that we are considering a pure sample of that specific molecule. Therefore, the task simplifies to identifying which of the named molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule must lack an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them are all coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Any molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. This indicates a single enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule is being considered. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two identically substituted stereocenters. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes the *meso* form of the compound. Meso compounds have chiral centers but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (e.g., a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, an `-H` atom, and the two distinct paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=` versus `-CH=CH-CH2-`). This makes C1 a stereocenter. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. The 1,3,5 substitution pattern on the ring ensures that, regardless of the chair conformation, the molecule will have a plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-*cis* isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An inspection of the structure shows no stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups (`-CH(CH3)2`), so it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any chiral elements.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds determined to be optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.

The core principle is that a compound will exhibit optical activity if its molecular structure is chiral and it is present in a form that is not a 50:50 mixture of its enantiomers (a racemic mixture). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which means it lacks internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nThe provided candidate answers are all in agreement on the analysis of each compound, even if they sometimes disagree on the final letter choice due to different option mappings. I will synthesize their unanimous reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them all lie in the same plane.

The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically Inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral because it lacks an internal symmetry element. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, a hydrogen atom, the path around the ring toward the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and the path around the ring away from the double bond (`-CH=CH-CH2-`). The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is achiral.

The molecule must be **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any internal symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n2.  The substance must be present in a **non-racemic** form (i.e., one enantiomer is in excess). The IUPAC names provided, which include stereochemical descriptors like `(R)`, `(S)`, `(3aR,7aS)`, etc., imply that we are considering a pure sample of a specific stereoisomer, thus fulfilling this condition if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\nThere is a complete consensus in the reasoning across all provided candidate answers. The analysis for each compound is as follows:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene.

Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which specify a single, specific stereoisomer. This is a complex, non-meso molecule. A pure sample of a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two identically substituted stereocenters. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry) that makes them achiral, despite the presence of stereocenters.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer is chiral because it lacks internal symmetry. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, an `-H` atom, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. It is a stereocenter. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a highly symmetrical molecule. Due to the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the molecule possesses at least one plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of the structure reveals no stereocenters. For example, the carbon at position 3 of the butanone chain is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Final Tally:**\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is **3**.\n\nMatching this number with the given options:\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**1. Principle of Optical Activity**\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is **chiral** and present in a **non-racemic** form (meaning one enantiomer is present in excess). A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. Key indicators for assessing chirality are:\n*   **Presence of stereocenters**: A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Absence of internal symmetry**: The molecule must lack a plane of symmetry (a plane that divides the molecule into two mirror-image halves) and a center of inversion (a point through which every atom can be reflected to an identical atom on the opposite side).\n*   **Meso Compounds**: These have stereocenters but are achiral due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Specified Stereoisomers**: The use of stereochemical descriptors like `(R)`, `(S)`, or naming a specific isomer implies we are evaluating a pure sample, which will be optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound**\nThe analysis is consistent across all candidate answers and is verified as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: **Optically inactive.** This is an alkene. The plane containing the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to it acts as an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: **Optically active.** The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which define a single enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule. A pure sample of a chiral molecule is inherently optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: **Optically inactive.** This molecule has two identically substituted stereocenters. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound, which is achiral due to an internal element of symmetry (a center of inversion in its stable conformation).\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: **Optically active.** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: **Optically active.** The carbon at position 1 (bonded to the -OH group) is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an `-H`, an `-OH`, and the two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=` vs. `-CH=CH-CH2-`). The `(R)` notation specifies a single, pure enantiomer.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: **Optically inactive.** This is a highly symmetrical molecule. Due to the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, it possesses a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: **Optically inactive.** An inspection of the structure reveals no stereocenters. For instance, the carbon at position 3 of the butanone chain is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral.\n\n**3.
