Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem asks about the conditions necessary to distinguish between two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. The fundamental physical principle governing this relationship is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes an inverse relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state (Δt or τ) and the inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" of its energy (ΔE). The mathematical expression is:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nFor practical calculations of this minimum energy width (often called the natural linewidth), the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ is used.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\nWe need to calculate the energy uncertainty for each state using their given lifetimes and the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n**3. Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. Each level is not a sharp line but is \"smeared out\" over its energy width. If the separation between the levels is smaller than these widths, their energy profiles will overlap to a degree where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger** energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). A robust criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual widths:\nRequired Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ **7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nWe now compare our requirement—that the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV—with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV   (Much smaller than the required separation)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV   (Much smaller than the required separation)\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV**   (Equivalent to 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly **larger** than the required separation)\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV   (Smaller than the required separation)\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is sufficiently large to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Principle and Constant:** The solution depends entirely on the correct application of the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle and the use of the *reduced* Planck constant (ħ), not the Planck constant (h). Using ħ in units of eV·s is the most direct approach.\n*   **Inverse Relationship:** A critical insight is that the state with the **shorter lifetime** (10⁻⁹ s) has the **larger energy width** (~10⁻⁷ eV) and is therefore the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n*   **Meaning of \"Clearly Resolved\":** This term implies that the energy separation must be significantly *greater than* the energy widths. An energy separation that is equal to or less than the widths would result in significant overlap, making the states indistinguishable. The options are several orders of magnitude apart, which makes the correct choice unambiguous.\n*   **Analyzing Agent Answers:** There is a unanimous consensus among all sound candidate answers on the physics, the calculations, and the final *numerical value* (10⁻⁴ eV). The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.

This relationship is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. It states that for a state with a lifetime (τ or Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations of this minimum energy width (the natural linewidth), we use the approximation:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n    \n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: We must calculate the energy width for both states using their given lifetimes.\n    *   **State 1**: Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2**: Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n3.  **Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**: For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. If the separation is smaller than these widths, their smeared energy profiles will overlap to a degree that makes them indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger** energy width (which corresponds to the **shorter** lifetime). In this case, the larger width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. A robust criterion for clear resolution is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths:\n    \n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ **7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**: We must compare this requirement—that the energy difference must be larger than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV—with the options provided.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV   (This is far too small.)\n    *   B) **10⁻⁴ eV**   (This is 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is significantly larger than the required separation.)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (This is 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is smaller than the required separation.)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (This is 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV, which is far too small.)\n\nThe only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Inverse Relationship**: The most crucial concept to apply correctly is the inverse relationship from the uncertainty principle: a **shorter** lifetime results in a **larger** energy width. The state with the 10⁻⁹ s lifetime is the limiting factor for resolution.\n*   **Resolution Condition**: The term \"clearly resolved\" means the energy separation must be significantly *greater than* the calculated energy widths.

The fundamental physical principle that governs this relationship is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations of the minimum energy uncertainty, often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width,\" we use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty (width) of the state's energy.\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n**2.

The mathematical relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical calculations, this minimum energy uncertainty, often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width,\" is approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n**Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. Each level is not a sharp, infinitely thin line but is \"smeared out\" over a range of energies ΔE. If the separation between the levels is smaller than these widths, their energy profiles will overlap to a degree where they are indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\nWe use the provided lifetimes and the value of ħ to find the energy width of each state.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nThe larger energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. For a robust condition of \"clear resolution,\" the energy separation should be greater than the sum of the widths: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\nWe now compare the required separation (> 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV) with the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV (or 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (or 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV (or 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV** (or 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is significantly **larger** than the required separation.\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure the states are clearly resolvable.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Principle:** It is crucial to identify and apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time and use the *reduced* Planck constant (ħ), not the Planck constant (h). Using ħ in units of eV·s is most direct.\n2.  **The Inverse Relationship:** A critical insight, correctly identified by all agents, is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy width. The state with the **shorter** lifetime (τ = 10⁻⁹ s) has the **larger** energy width (ΔE ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV) and is therefore the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n3.  **Resolution Condition:** The term \"clearly resolved\" requires that the energy separation must be *significantly greater* than the energy widths. A separation equal to or smaller than the widths would result in significant overlap, making the states indistinguishable.\n4.  **Synthesizing Agent Answers:** All the candidate answers show a remarkable consensus on the physics, the calculation method, and the final numerical result (10⁻⁴ eV). The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. This confirms the robustness of the physical conclusion, independent of the option labeling.\n5.  **Final Mapping:** The correct procedure is to perform the physical calculation to find the required numerical value (10⁻⁴ eV) and then map it to the specific list of options provided in the question prompt.

The core physical principle governing this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision of a state's energy (ΔE) based on its lifetime (Δt or τ). The mathematical relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For practical calculations of this minimum energy uncertainty, often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\", we use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: We must calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using their given lifetimes.

The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime** (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). A robust condition is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths.\n    *   Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ **7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**: We now compare this requirement (the energy difference must be > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV) with the options provided in the question:\n    A) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    B) 10⁻⁸ eV\n    C) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n    D) 10⁻⁴ eV\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV (= 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than the required separation.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is far smaller than the required separation.\n    *   D) **10⁻⁴ eV** (= 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is significantly **larger** than the required separation.\n\n### Careful points\n\n1.  **Correct Principle**: It is essential to identify the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as the correct physical basis and to use the Energy-Time formulation (ΔE ⋅ Δt).\n2.  **Inverse Relationship**: A critical insight is the inverse relationship between lifetime and energy width. The state with the **shorter** lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the **larger** energy width (~10⁻⁷ eV) and is therefore the primary factor limiting the resolution.\n3.  **Meaning of \"Clearly Resolved\"**: This term implies that the energy separation must be significantly *greater than* the inherent widths of the energy levels. An energy separation that is smaller than or comparable to the widths would mean the energy profiles overlap substantially, making them impossible to distinguish.\n4.  **Reconciling Candidate Answers**: The candidate answers unanimously agree on the physical reasoning, the calculations, and the final *numerical value* of 10⁻⁴ eV. The fact that they selected different letters (A, B, C, or D) is an artifact of the test platform presenting the multiple-choice options in a different, randomized order for each agent.

Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem requires relating the lifetime of a quantum state to the distinguishability of its energy level. The fundamental principle that governs this is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. This principle establishes a trade-off: a state with a finite lifetime (Δt or τ) has an inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is mathematically expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical calculations of this minimum energy width, often called the \"natural linewidth,\" we use the approximation:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**.\n\n**2.
