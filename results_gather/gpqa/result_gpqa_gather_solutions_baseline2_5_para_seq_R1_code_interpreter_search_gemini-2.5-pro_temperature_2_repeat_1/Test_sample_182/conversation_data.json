The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: Indicates one six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates one C=C double bond within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: Contains one C=C double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: An aldehyde containing one C=O double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: Contains one C=O double bond. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent.\n\n*   **Effect on Multiple Bonds**: It reduces all pi bonds—both carbon-carbon (C=C) and carbon-oxygen (C=O)—to single bonds.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups**: It completely reduces oxygen-containing groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms, removing the oxygen atoms.\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton**: Critically, this strong reagent combination preserves the stable sigma-bond framework of the ring. The ring is not opened.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n*   Initial state: 1 ring, 4 pi bonds.\n*   Reaction: The 4 pi bonds are eliminated.\n*   Final state: The 1 ring remains.\n\nThe IHD of the **product** is calculated based on its final structure:\n*   Number of rings = **1**\n*   Number of pi bonds = **0**\n*   Final IHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: A common pitfall is calculating the IHD of the starting material (which is 5) and selecting that as the answer. Option B) 5 is a distractor targeting this mistake.\n*   **Ring Preservation**: Another error is to assume the ring is also broken. If it were, the IHD would be 0. The ring remains a source of unsaturation, making option A) 0 incorrect.\n*   **Reagent Specificity**: It is crucial to know that Red P + HI is a non-selective, exhaustive reducing agent. A less powerful reagent would yield a different product with a different IHD. For instance, a reaction that only reduced the C=C bonds would result in an IHD of 3 (1 for the ring + 2 for the C=O bonds), matching distractor D) 3. The specified reagent reduces everything reducible except the ring itself.\n*   **Consensus from Candidates**: All the provided candidate answers, despite having randomized options, reached a unanimous conclusion in their chemical reasoning: the final product's IHD is 1.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe initial molecule has an IHD of 5. The exhaustive reduction with Red P + HI eliminates the four pi bonds but preserves the single ring. Therefore, the product has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the consensus from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for reaching the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step is to determine the degree of unsaturation of the starting material, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated by summing the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` base of the name indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a C=C double bond within the ring, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the function of this reagent.\n\n*   **Function**: Red P + HI is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   **Effect on Bonds**: The reaction eliminates all pi bonds by reducing all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means the four pi bonds identified in Step 1 will be removed.\n*   **Effect on Structure**: This strong reduction preserves the stable sigma (σ) bond framework of the carbon skeleton. The `cyclohexane` ring is not broken during the reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction transforms the reactant by removing all sources of unsaturation from the pi bonds while leaving the ring structure intact.\n\n*   Initial state: 1 ring, 4 π bonds.\n*   Reaction: The 4 π bonds are eliminated.\n*   Final state: The 1 ring is preserved.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is calculated based on its remaining structural features:\n*   Number of rings = **1**\n*   Number of π bonds = **0**\n\nThe IHD of the **product** = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: A common pitfall is calculating the IHD of the reactant (which is 5) and selecting that as the final answer. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**. Option (A) 5 is a distractor targeting this mistake.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: Another potential error is to assume that such a strong reducing agent breaks the ring. If the ring were broken, the IHD would be 0. Option (D) 0 is a distractor targeting this misunderstanding. The sigma-bonded ring structure is stable enough to survive this reaction.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction**: It is essential to know that Red P + HI is a non-selective, powerful agent that reduces *all* the functional groups mentioned. If one were to assume only the C=C bonds are reduced, for example, the two C=O bonds would remain, leading to a wrong IHD of 3 (1 for the ring + 2 for the C=O bonds). Option (B) 3 serves as a distractor for scenarios of incomplete reduction.\n4.  **Consensus Reasoning**: All provided candidate answers, despite showing different option letters due to randomized ordering in their original prompts, unanimously agree on the chemical reasoning: the initial IHD is 5, and the reaction reduces the four pi bonds but preserves the single ring, leading to a final IHD of 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the reactant's structure and the reaction's effect, the four pi bonds are eliminated, but the single ring remains. This leads to an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of **1** for the product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a synthesis of the provided candidate answers, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step is to determine the degree of unsaturation of the starting molecule, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates one six-membered ring, which contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates one C=C double bond within the ring, which contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: This contains a C=C double bond, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these gives the total IHD of the reactant:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and the Effect of the Reagent**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: This is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all functional groups containing multiple bonds or oxygen atoms to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule**:\n    *   It reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds, thus eliminating all **four π bonds**.\n    *   It removes the oxygen atoms from the formyl and carboxylic acid groups.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds of the ring. The ring skeleton is **preserved**.\n\n**3. Determine the IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaves the ring itself intact. We can calculate the IHD of the product by considering its final structure.\n\n*   **Number of rings in product**: 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds in product**: 0 (all four π bonds were eliminated by the reduction).\n\nThe IHD of the product is the sum of these features:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product**: The IHD of the reactant is 5. This value is listed as option **C) 5** and is a common distractor. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: After the exhaustive reduction, all pi bonds are gone, but the ring itself remains a source of unsaturation. Therefore, the IHD is 1. If one were to incorrectly assume the ring also breaks, the answer would be 0, which is listed as option **A) 0**.\n3.  **Reagent Knowledge**: The key to this problem is correctly identifying that Red P + HI is a strong, non-selective reducing agent that completely saturates the molecule but preserves the alicyclic ring structure.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe reactant has an IHD of 5 (1 ring + 4 pi bonds). The powerful reducing agent eliminates the four pi bonds but leaves the single ring intact. The resulting product, a substituted cyclohexane, therefore has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nMatching the calculated value to the provided options:\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 5\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nFirst, we must determine the IHD of the starting molecule, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **Ring Structure:** The `cyclohex` part of the name indicates there is one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) Bonds:** We need to count all the double bonds.\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a C=C double bond within the ring. (Contribution: +1)\n    2.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond. (Contribution: +1)\n    3.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a C=O double bond. (Contribution: +1)\n    4.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond. (Contribution: +1)\n*   **Total Reactant IHD:** Summing these up gives: 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. The effect of this reagent is the key to solving the problem.\n*   **Reagent Function:** As unanimously agreed upon by all the candidate answers, this combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its function is to reduce a molecule almost completely to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n*   **Effect on the Molecule:**\n    *   It reduces all pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means the **four pi bonds** identified above will be eliminated.\n    *   It completely removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids.\n    *   Critically, this reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable sigma bonds of the ring. Therefore, the **ring skeleton is preserved**.\n\n**3. Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact. We can now calculate the IHD for the final product.\n*   **Number of rings in product:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds in product:** 0 (all four pi bonds were reduced to single bonds).\n*   **Total Product IHD:** 1 (ring) + 0 (π bonds) = **1**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Reactant vs. Product IHD:** The most common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the reactant (which is 5) and select that answer. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**. This matches option **B) 5**.\n*   **Ring Preservation:** Another potential error is assuming the ring is broken. If the ring were broken, the final IHD would be 0. This matches option **C) 0**. However, the reaction preserves the stable cycloalkane ring.\n*   **Reagent Strength:** Understanding that Red P + HI is a non-selective, exhaustive reducing agent is essential. A weaker or more selective reagent might not reduce all functional groups, leading to a different IHD (e.g., 3, which matches option **A) 3**).\n*   **Consensus:** The provided candidate answers all followed the same logical steps and unanimously concluded that the final IHD is 1, even though their final letter answers differed due to randomized option ordering. This gives high confidence in the chemical reasoning.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe initial IHD is 5 (1 ring + 4 pi bonds). The reaction eliminates the 4 pi bonds but preserves the ring. Therefore, the final IHD of the product is 1.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. We calculate this by identifying all sources of unsaturation from the name:\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: Indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This π bond contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group** (-CHO): This aldehyde functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This π bond contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This π bond contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This π bond contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function:** This combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all reducible functional groups completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:**\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   All oxygen-containing functional groups, like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are completely reduced. The C=O bonds are saturated, and the oxygen atoms are removed.\n*   **Effect on the Carbon Skeleton:** The reaction is harsh enough to eliminate all π bonds but is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds of the ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation from pi bonds but leaves the ring structure itself intact.\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The 1 ring remains in the final product.\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane. Its IHD is calculated based on its final structure:\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all have been reduced).\n\nThe IHD of the **product** = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n---\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: The IHD of the reactant is 5 (Option A). This is a common distractor for students who calculate the initial IHD but do not analyze the effect of the reaction. The question asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: It is crucial to know that the ring structure is not broken. An IHD of 0 (Option C) would imply that the final product is an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, which is incorrect. The ring's presence is the sole reason the final IHD is 1.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction**: Understanding that Red P + HI is a powerful, non-selective reducing agent is key. Weaker reagents might only reduce the C=C bonds and the aldehyde, leading to an incorrect IHD of 2 or 3 (Option D). This reaction is exhaustive and removes all pi bonds.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, based on the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe first step is to determine the degree of unsaturation of the starting material, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Ring Structure**: The name `cyclohex-` indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) Bonds**: We must count all double bonds in the molecule.\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) is an aldehyde containing a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these contributions together, the total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its specific function is to:\n\n*   **Reduce all pi bonds**: It saturates all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen multiple bonds, converting them to single bonds. This means the four pi bonds identified in Step 1 will be eliminated.\n*   **Remove oxygen atoms**: It removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, reducing them to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Preserve the carbon skeleton**: The reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the alicyclic ring. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   The reactant started with 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The 1 ring remains in the product.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is calculated by summing its remaining unsaturation features:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0\n*   **IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distractor 1: IHD of Reactant**: The initial IHD of the reactant is 5. Option (C) is 5. It is a common error to calculate the IHD of the starting material instead of the product.\n*   **Distractor 2: Complete Saturation**: The reduction is exhaustive, but the term \"saturation\" can be misleading. While all pi bonds are saturated, the ring itself is a form of unsaturation according to the IHD formula. An answer of 0 (Option D) would be incorrect because it implies the ring was also broken.\n*   **Reagent Knowledge**: The key to solving this problem is recognizing the specific function of Red P + HI as an exhaustive reducing agent that preserves ring structures. Weaker agents would yield a different product with a higher IHD.\n*   **Consensus of Agents**: All 15 candidate answers, despite having randomized options, reached the same conclusion through the same chemical logic: the final IHD is 1.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the unanimous reasoning provided by the candidate agents.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is calculated by summing the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **One Ring:** The `cyclohex-` part of the name indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four Pi (π) Bonds:** We identify all the double bonds from the name:\n    1.  `-3-ene`: One C=C double bond within the ring. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    2.  `formyl` group (-CHO): One C=O double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    3.  `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂): One C=C double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    4.  `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH): One C=O double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n\nThe total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and the Reagent\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This is a critical piece of information.\n*   **Function of the Reagent:** This combination is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule:**\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds to single bonds. This means all **four π bonds** are eliminated.\n    *   It completely removes the oxygen atoms from the formyl and carboxylic acid groups.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable carbon-carbon sigma bonds that form the ring.

The 1 ring remains.\n*   Final structure: The product is a substituted cyclohexane with only single bonds.\n\nThe IHD of the **product** is calculated as:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0\n*   **IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the **product**, which is 1. The IHD of the reactant is 5, which matches option (B). This is a classic distractor.\n2.  **Ring Integrity:** The ring structure itself counts as one degree of unsaturation. Since the ring is not broken, the final IHD cannot be 0. Option (D) is incorrect because it implies the ring was also eliminated.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction:** The specific reagent (Red P + HI) ensures that *all* pi bonds are removed. A weaker reagent might give a different product and thus a different IHD (for example, leaving the C=O bonds intact, which would lead to an IHD of 3, matching option C).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous reasoning is that the reaction eliminates the four pi bonds but preserves the single ring.

Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule:**\n    1.  All pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) are reduced to single bonds. This means the four π bonds identified in Step 1 are eliminated.\n    2.  The stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring are **not** broken. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe reaction removes all the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   **Reactant IHD contributions:** 1 ring, 4 π bonds.\n*   **Product IHD contributions:** The 4 π bonds are removed, but the 1 ring remains.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final **product** is calculated as:\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the *product* (which is 1). The IHD of the *reactant* is 5, which corresponds to option **D**, a common distractor.\n2.  **Ring Preservation:** The ring itself contributes one degree of unsaturation. After the reduction of all pi bonds, the IHD is 1, not 0. Option **B) 0** would only be correct if the ring was also broken, which doesn't happen in this reaction.\n3.  **Strength of the Reagent:** The use of Red P + HI is specific. It is a non-selective, exhaustive reducing agent. A milder reagent might have only reduced some of the functional groups, leading to a different IHD. For instance, if only the two C=C bonds were reduced, the IHD would be 3 (1 ring + 2 C=O bonds), which is option **A**. Correctly identifying the reagent's power is crucial.\n4.  **Consensus:** All provided candidate answers correctly identified the reactant's IHD as 5, correctly identified the function of the reducing agent, and correctly calculated the product's IHD as 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the final product is **1**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the unanimous chemical reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step is to deconstruct the name of the starting material, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, to determine its degree of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This base name indicates a six-membered ring structure. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) Bonds**: We count all double bonds in the molecule.\n    1.  **`-3-ene`**: A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.

(Contribution: **+1**)\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is: 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and the Reagent**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a well-known, powerful, and exhaustive reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Function**: Its purpose is to reduce nearly all functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule**:\n    *   It reduces all pi bonds (both the C=C and C=O bonds identified above) to single bonds. This means all **four π bonds** are eliminated.\n    *   It completely removes the oxygen atoms from the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups.\n    *   Crucially, the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring skeleton are **preserved** and not broken by this reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   Initial state: 1 ring, 4 π bonds (IHD = 5)\n*   Final state: The 4 π bonds are removed, but the 1 ring remains.\n\nThe IHD of the **product** is calculated from its final structure:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0\n*   **IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product**: The IHD of the reactant is 5, which corresponds to option D. This is a common distractor. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: The reaction is not strong enough to break the stable ring structure. If it did, the IHD would be 0, corresponding to option A. The fact that the ring remains is the reason the IHD is 1.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction**: It is essential to know that Red P + HI is a non-selective, strong reducing agent. A weaker agent might only reduce some of the bonds, leading to a different IHD. For instance, an IHD of 3 (option B) could result from a partial reduction, which is incorrect for this specific reagent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical analysis unanimously shows that the reactant (IHD=5) is exhaustively reduced, eliminating its four pi bonds but preserving its single ring. Therefore, the product has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nMatching this value to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 1\nD) 5\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds. We can determine the IHD by examining the different parts of the molecule's name and structure:\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a well-known, powerful, and exhaustive reducing agent. Its effects are:\n*   **Complete Saturation:** It reduces all multiple bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds in the reactant will be eliminated.\n*   **Deoxygenation:** It completely removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, reducing them to their corresponding hydrocarbon parts.\n*   **Preservation of the Carbon Skeleton:** Critically, this strong reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and Final IHD\nThe reaction transforms the reactant by removing all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaving the ring structure intact.\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The product retains the 1 ring.\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. We can now calculate its IHD:\n*   **Number of rings in product:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π bonds in product:** 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the **product**. The IHD of the reactant is 5, which corresponds to option A. This is a common distractor.\n2.  **Ring Integrity:** After the reduction removes all pi bonds, one might mistakenly assume the IHD is 0 (Option D). However, the ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, so the IHD must be at least 1.\n3.  **Reagent Specificity:** The key to the problem is knowing that Red P + HI is a non-selective, exhaustive reducing agent. A weaker agent would have produced a different result and a different IHD (e.g., possibly 3, as in option C).\n\nBased on the consistent chemical reasoning, the final IHD is **1**. This matches option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, incorporating a consensus from the provided candidate answers and highlighting crucial points for a clear understanding.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe first step is to deconstruct the name of the starting molecule, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD, or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates the presence of one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This signifies one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This functional group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD(reactant) = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. The key to solving this problem is understanding the function of this specific reagent combination.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: Red P + excess HI is a very powerful and **exhaustive** reducing agent. Its primary purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule**:\n    *   All carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds (all π bonds) are reduced to single bonds.\n    *   Oxygen atoms are completely removed from functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH).\n    *   The stable carbon-carbon sigma bonds that form the ring are preserved. The ring is not opened.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation from the reactant except for the ring itself.\n\n*   The **4 π bonds** present in the reactant are all eliminated.\n*   The **1 ring** remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is fully saturated but still contains one ring. Its IHD is calculated as:\n*   **Number of rings in product**: 1\n*   **Number of π bonds in product**: 0\n\nIHD(product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: A very common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the starting material (which is 5) and choose that as the answer. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**. Option (B) is 5, making it a classic distractor.\n2.  **Exhaustive Reduction vs. Partial Reduction**: It is essential to know that Red P + HI is a strong, non-selective reducing agent. A weaker agent might have reduced the C=C bonds but not the carboxylic acid, leading to a product with IHD = 3 (1 for the ring + 2 for the C=O bonds). Option (A) is 3, which is a distractor targeting this misunderstanding.\n3.  **Preservation of the Ring**: After the exhaustive reduction of all π bonds, the ring itself remains. The ring is a source of unsaturation, contributing 1 to the IHD. If the ring were also broken (which does not happen here), the IHD would be 0. Option (C) is 0, which incorrectly assumes the ring is also destroyed.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe chemical reasoning, supported by all the provided candidate analyses, leads to one definitive conclusion: the initial molecule has an IHD of 5 (1 ring + 4 pi bonds). The powerful reducing agent eliminates the 4 pi bonds but preserves the 1 ring. Therefore, the final product has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of **1**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\n    The reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.

Forgetting the ring's contribution would lead to an incorrect answer of 0 (Option B).\n*   **Knowledge of Reagent:** The key to the problem is knowing that Red P + HI is a powerful reducing agent that saturates all multiple bonds but leaves the sigma bond framework of the ring intact. If only partial reduction occurred (e.g., only the C=C bonds were reduced), the answer might have been 3 (Option D), which is also an incorrect outcome for this specific reagent.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis unanimously shows that the reactant (IHD = 5) is exhaustively reduced, eliminating all four of its pi bonds but preserving its single ring. Therefore, the product has an IHD of 1.\n\nMatching the calculated value with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

This value is a common distractor in multiple-choice questions (e.g., options A and D in some of the candidate answers). The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Preservation of the Ring:** After the exhaustive reduction, all pi bonds are gone. However, the ring itself still counts as one unit of hydrogen deficiency. Therefore, the answer is 1, not 0. An answer of 0 would imply the product is an acyclic (non-ring), saturated alkane.\n3.  **Knowledge of the Reagent:** The key to solving this problem is understanding that Red P + HI is a very strong, non-selective reducing agent. A weaker or more selective reagent (e.g., NaBH₄ or H₂/Pd) would yield a different product with a higher IHD. For instance, some reagents might reduce C=C bonds but not C=O bonds, which would lead to an incorrect answer like 3.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is correct.

Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nFirst, we must understand the structure of the starting molecule, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, and calculate its degree of unsaturation, also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This part of the name indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This suffix indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is one π bond, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group** (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group** (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and the Reagent**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is known in organic chemistry as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule**:\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the ring and the one in the vinyl group) will be reduced to single bonds.\n    *   All carbon-oxygen double bonds (in the formyl and carboxylic acid groups) will be completely reduced, and the oxygen atoms will be removed. Effectively, -CHO and -COOH are both reduced to -CH₃.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring structure. Therefore, the cyclohexane ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation that came from pi bonds but leaves the ring itself untouched.\n\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The resulting product retains the 1 ring.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a fully saturated molecule, meaning it has no pi bonds, but it is still cyclic. We can now calculate its IHD:\n\n*   **Number of rings in the product:** 1\n*   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** 0\n\nThe IHD of the **product** = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: The IHD of the starting material is 5, which matches option (C). This is a common distractor. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: After the exhaustive reduction removes all pi bonds, one might mistakenly think the IHD is 0. However, the ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation relative to an open-chain molecule with the same number of carbons. The ring is preserved in this reaction, so the IHD cannot be 0. Option (D) is a distractor for this mistake.\n3.  **Reagent Strength**: Recognizing that Red P + HI is a powerful, non-selective reducing agent is key. A weaker or more selective reagent would lead to a different product and thus a different IHD. For instance, if only the C=C bonds were reduced, the two C=O bonds and the ring would remain, giving an IHD of 3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step is to deconstruct the name of the starting material, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, to determine its structural features and calculate its degree of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This base name indicates a six-membered ring structure. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) Bonds**: We must count all double bonds present in the molecule based on its functional groups and name.\n    1.  **`-3-ene`**: Indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    2.  **`formyl` group** (-CHO): An aldehyde group containing a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). (Contribution: **+1**)\n    3.  **`vinyl` group** (-CH=CH₂): A substituent containing a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). (Contribution: **+1**)\n    4.  **`carboxylic acid` group** (-COOH): A functional group containing a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). (Contribution: **+1**)\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the function of this reagent combination.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: This is a powerful and **exhaustive** reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule**:\n    *   It reduces all pi bonds—both carbon-carbon (C=C) and carbon-oxygen (C=O)—to single bonds. This means the four pi bonds identified in Step 1 are eliminated.\n    *   It completely removes oxygen atoms from the functional groups (deoxygenation).\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable carbon-carbon sigma bonds that form the ring. The ring skeleton is **preserved**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation due to the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   **Initial state**: 1 ring, 4 π bonds (IHD = 5)\n*   **Transformation**: The 4 π bonds are eliminated by reduction. The 1 ring is preserved.\n*   **Final state**: The product has 1 ring and 0 π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final **product** is calculated by summing its remaining sources of unsaturation:\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: The IHD of the starting material is 5. Option **D) 5** is a common distractor that tests whether the student considers the effect of the reaction. The question asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: The reaction is exhaustive, but the term \"saturation\" applies to the elimination of pi bonds, not the breaking of the ring. The ring itself contributes one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the final IHD is 1, not 0. Option **B) 0** is incorrect because it implies the ring was also destroyed.\n3.  **Reagent Specificity and Strength**: The use of Red P + HI is specific. It ensures a complete, non-selective reduction of the relevant functional groups. Weaker or more selective reducing agents would result in a partial reduction, potentially leaving an IHD of 3 (Option C) if, for instance, the C=O bonds were not reduced. Knowledge of the specific reagent's power is essential.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe first step is to determine the degree of unsaturation of the starting material, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated by summing the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **One Ring**: The `cyclohex-` base of the name indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four Pi (π) Bonds**:\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a C=C double bond within the ring, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a C=C double bond, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) contains a C=O double bond, contributing **+1** to the IHD.\n    4.

Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the function of this reagent.\n\n*   **Function**: Red P + HI is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   **Effect on Bonds**: The reaction eliminates all pi bonds by reducing all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means the four pi bonds identified in Step 1 will be removed.\n*   **Effect on Structure**: This strong reduction preserves the stable sigma (σ) bond framework of the carbon skeleton. The `cyclohexane` ring is not broken during the reaction.\n\n**3. Determine the IHD of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction transforms the reactant by removing all sources of unsaturation from the pi bonds while leaving the ring structure intact.\n\n*   Initial state: 1 ring, 4 π bonds.\n*   Reaction: The 4 π bonds are eliminated.\n*   Final state: The 1 ring is preserved.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is calculated based on its remaining structural features:\n*   Number of rings = **1**\n*   Number of π bonds = **0**\n\nThe IHD of the **product** = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: A common pitfall is calculating the IHD of the reactant (which is 5) and selecting that as the final answer. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**. Option (A) 5 is a distractor targeting this mistake.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: Another potential error is to assume that such a strong reducing agent breaks the ring. If the ring were broken, the IHD would be 0. Option (D) 0 is a distractor targeting this misunderstanding. The sigma-bonded ring structure is stable enough to survive this reaction.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction**: It is essential to know that Red P + HI is a non-selective, powerful agent that reduces *all* the functional groups mentioned. If one were to assume only the C=C bonds are reduced, for example, the two C=O bonds would remain, leading to a wrong IHD of 3 (1 for the ring + 2 for the C=O bonds). Option (B) 3 serves as a distractor for scenarios of incomplete reduction.\n4.  **Consensus Reasoning**: All provided candidate answers, despite showing different option letters due to randomized ordering in their original prompts, unanimously agree on the chemical reasoning: the initial IHD is 5, and the reaction reduces the four pi bonds but preserves the single ring, leading to a final IHD of 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the reactant's structure and the reaction's effect, the four pi bonds are eliminated, but the single ring remains.

The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**. This matches option **B) 5**.\n*   **Ring Preservation:** Another potential error is assuming the ring is broken. If the ring were broken, the final IHD would be 0. This matches option **C) 0**. However, the reaction preserves the stable cycloalkane ring.\n*   **Reagent Strength:** Understanding that Red P + HI is a non-selective, exhaustive reducing agent is essential.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule. We calculate this by identifying all sources of unsaturation from the name:\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: Indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This π bond contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group** (-CHO): This aldehyde functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This π bond contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This π bond contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This π bond contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and its Effect on the Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n*   **Reagent Function:** This combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all reducible functional groups completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   **Effect on Functional Groups:**\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   All oxygen-containing functional groups, like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are completely reduced.

This is a common distractor for students who calculate the initial IHD but do not analyze the effect of the reaction. The question asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: It is crucial to know that the ring structure is not broken. An IHD of 0 (Option C) would imply that the final product is an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, which is incorrect. The ring's presence is the sole reason the final IHD is 1.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction**: Understanding that Red P + HI is a powerful, non-selective reducing agent is key. Weaker reagents might only reduce the C=C bonds and the aldehyde, leading to an incorrect IHD of 2 or 3 (Option D). This reaction is exhaustive and removes all pi bonds.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is **1**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, based on the unanimous reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe first step is to determine the degree of unsaturation of the starting material, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Ring Structure**: The name `cyclohex-` indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) Bonds**: We must count all double bonds in the molecule.\n    1.  The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    2.  The `formyl` group (-CHO) is an aldehyde containing a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    3.  The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n    4.  The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n\nAdding these contributions together, the total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its specific function is to:\n\n*   **Reduce all pi bonds**: It saturates all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen multiple bonds, converting them to single bonds. This means the four pi bonds identified in Step 1 will be eliminated.\n*   **Remove oxygen atoms**: It removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, reducing them to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Preserve the carbon skeleton**: The reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the alicyclic ring. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation due to the pi bonds but leaves the ring structure intact.\n\n*   The reactant started with 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The 1 ring remains in the product.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the final product is calculated by summing its remaining unsaturation features:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0\n*   **IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distractor 1: IHD of Reactant**: The initial IHD of the reactant is 5. Option (C) is 5. It is a common error to calculate the IHD of the starting material instead of the product.\n*   **Distractor 2: Complete Saturation**: The reduction is exhaustive, but the term \"saturation\" can be misleading. While all pi bonds are saturated, the ring itself is a form of unsaturation according to the IHD formula. An answer of 0 (Option D) would be incorrect because it implies the ring was also broken.\n*   **Reagent Knowledge**: The key to solving this problem is recognizing the specific function of Red P + HI as an exhaustive reducing agent that preserves ring structures. Weaker agents would yield a different product with a higher IHD.\n*   **Consensus of Agents**: All 15 candidate answers, despite having randomized options, reached the same conclusion through the same chemical logic: the final IHD is 1.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the unanimous reasoning provided by the candidate agents.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is calculated by summing the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **One Ring:** The `cyclohex-` part of the name indicates a six-membered ring. This contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **Four Pi (π) Bonds:** We identify all the double bonds from the name:\n    1.  `-3-ene`: One C=C double bond within the ring. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    2.  `formyl` group (-CHO): One C=O double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    3.  `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂): One C=C double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n    4.  `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH): One C=O double bond. (Contribution: **+1**)\n\nThe total IHD of the **reactant** is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and the Reagent\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This is a critical piece of information.\n*   **Function of the Reagent:** This combination is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule:**\n    *   It reduces all carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds to single bonds. This means all **four π bonds** are eliminated.\n    *   It completely removes the oxygen atoms from the formyl and carboxylic acid groups.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable carbon-carbon sigma bonds that form the ring. The ring skeleton is **preserved**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product and its Final IHD\n\nThe reaction removes all the unsaturation from the pi bonds but leaves the unsaturation due to the ring structure intact.\n*   Initial sources of IHD: 1 ring, 4 π bonds.\n*   After reaction: The 4 π bonds are removed. The 1 ring remains.\n*   Final structure: The product is a substituted cyclohexane with only single bonds.\n\nThe IHD of the **product** is calculated as:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds = 0\n*   **IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the **product**, which is 1. The IHD of the reactant is 5, which matches option (B). This is a classic distractor.\n2.  **Ring Integrity:** The ring structure itself counts as one degree of unsaturation. Since the ring is not broken, the final IHD cannot be 0. Option (D) is incorrect because it implies the ring was also eliminated.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction:** The specific reagent (Red P + HI) ensures that *all* pi bonds are removed. A weaker reagent might give a different product and thus a different IHD (for example, leaving the C=O bonds intact, which would lead to an IHD of 3, matching option C).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous reasoning is that the reaction eliminates the four pi bonds but preserves the single ring. This changes the IHD from 5 in the reactant to 1 in the product. The correct numerical answer is 1.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 1\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Calculate its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe first step is to deconstruct the name of the reactant, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, to determine its structure and count its sources of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **+1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This suffix indicates a carbon-carbon double bond within the ring structure.

The key to solving the problem is to understand the effect of this reagent.\n\n*   **Reagent Function:** This combination is a very powerful and **exhaustive reducing agent**. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule:**\n    1.  All pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) are reduced to single bonds. This means the four π bonds identified in Step 1 are eliminated.\n    2.  The stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring are **not** broken.

The IHD of the *reactant* is 5, which corresponds to option **D**, a common distractor.\n2.  **Ring Preservation:** The ring itself contributes one degree of unsaturation. After the reduction of all pi bonds, the IHD is 1, not 0. Option **B) 0** would only be correct if the ring was also broken, which doesn't happen in this reaction.\n3.  **Strength of the Reagent:** The use of Red P + HI is specific. It is a non-selective, exhaustive reducing agent. A milder reagent might have only reduced some of the functional groups, leading to a different IHD. For instance, if only the two C=C bonds were reduced, the IHD would be 3 (1 ring + 2 C=O bonds), which is option **A**. Correctly identifying the reagent's power is crucial.\n4.  **Consensus:** All provided candidate answers correctly identified the reactant's IHD as 5, correctly identified the function of the reducing agent, and correctly calculated the product's IHD as 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the final product is **1**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the unanimous chemical reasoning of the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

This is a common distractor. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: The reaction is not strong enough to break the stable ring structure. If it did, the IHD would be 0, corresponding to option A. The fact that the ring remains is the reason the IHD is 1.\n3.  **Exhaustive Reduction**: It is essential to know that Red P + HI is a non-selective, strong reducing agent. A weaker agent might only reduce some of the bonds, leading to a different IHD. For instance, an IHD of 3 (option B) could result from a partial reduction, which is incorrect for this specific reagent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical analysis unanimously shows that the reactant (IHD=5) is exhaustively reduced, eliminating its four pi bonds but preserving its single ring. Therefore, the product has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nMatching this value to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 1\nD) 5\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe starting molecule is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds. We can determine the IHD by examining the different parts of the molecule's name and structure:\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl`** (-CHO): This aldehyde group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl`** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid`** (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**. This combination is a well-known, powerful, and exhaustive reducing agent. Its effects are:\n*   **Complete Saturation:** It reduces all multiple bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. This means all four pi bonds in the reactant will be eliminated.\n*   **Deoxygenation:** It completely removes oxygen atoms from functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids, reducing them to their corresponding hydrocarbon parts.\n*   **Preservation of the Carbon Skeleton:** Critically, this strong reaction is not harsh enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring. The ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and Final IHD\nThe reaction transforms the reactant by removing all sources of unsaturation due to pi bonds but leaving the ring structure intact.\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The product retains the 1 ring.\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated, substituted cyclohexane. We can now calculate its IHD:\n*   **Number of rings in product:** 1 (the ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of π bonds in product:** 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product:** The question asks for the IHD of the **product**. The IHD of the reactant is 5, which corresponds to option A. This is a common distractor.\n2.  **Ring Integrity:** After the reduction removes all pi bonds, one might mistakenly assume the IHD is 0 (Option D). However, the ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, so the IHD must be at least 1.\n3.  **Reagent Specificity:** The key to the problem is knowing that Red P + HI is a non-selective, exhaustive reducing agent. A weaker agent would have produced a different result and a different IHD (e.g., possibly 3, as in option C).\n\nBased on the consistent chemical reasoning, the final IHD is **1**. This matches option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, incorporating a consensus from the provided candidate answers and highlighting crucial points for a clear understanding.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant's Structure and Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe first step is to deconstruct the name of the starting molecule, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD, or degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This indicates the presence of one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This signifies one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: This functional group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD(reactant) = 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. The key to solving this problem is understanding the function of this specific reagent combination.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: Red P + excess HI is a very powerful and **exhaustive** reducing agent. Its primary purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule**:\n    *   All carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds (all π bonds) are reduced to single bonds.\n    *   Oxygen atoms are completely removed from functional groups like aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH).\n    *   The stable carbon-carbon sigma bonds that form the ring are preserved. The ring is not opened.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Final Product\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation from the reactant except for the ring itself.\n\n*   The **4 π bonds** present in the reactant are all eliminated.\n*   The **1 ring** remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is fully saturated but still contains one ring. Its IHD is calculated as:\n*   **Number of rings in product**: 1\n*   **Number of π bonds in product**: 0\n\nIHD(product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: A very common mistake is to calculate the IHD of the starting material (which is 5) and choose that as the answer. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**. Option (B) is 5, making it a classic distractor.\n2.  **Exhaustive Reduction vs. Partial Reduction**: It is essential to know that Red P + HI is a strong, non-selective reducing agent. A weaker agent might have reduced the C=C bonds but not the carboxylic acid, leading to a product with IHD = 3 (1 for the ring + 2 for the C=O bonds). Option (A) is 3, which is a distractor targeting this misunderstanding.\n3.  **Preservation of the Ring**: After the exhaustive reduction of all π bonds, the ring itself remains. The ring is a source of unsaturation, contributing 1 to the IHD. If the ring were also broken (which does not happen here), the IHD would be 0. Option (C) is 0, which incorrectly assumes the ring is also destroyed.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe chemical reasoning, supported by all the provided candidate analyses, leads to one definitive conclusion: the initial molecule has an IHD of 5 (1 ring + 4 pi bonds).

This value is a common distractor in multiple-choice questions (e.g., options A and D in some of the candidate answers). The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Preservation of the Ring:** After the exhaustive reduction, all pi bonds are gone. However, the ring itself still counts as one unit of hydrogen deficiency. Therefore, the answer is 1, not 0. An answer of 0 would imply the product is an acyclic (non-ring), saturated alkane.\n3.  **Knowledge of the Reagent:** The key to solving this problem is understanding that Red P + HI is a very strong, non-selective reducing agent. A weaker or more selective reagent (e.g., NaBH₄ or H₂/Pd) would yield a different product with a higher IHD.

The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n\n*   **Ring:** The `cyclohex` part of the name indicates one six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **Pi (π) Bonds:** We must count all double bonds in the molecule.\n    1.  `-3-ene`: Indicates a carbon-carbon (C=C) double bond inside the ring.

The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product** after the reaction. The value '5' is listed as option D.\n2.  **Ring Preservation:** It is crucial to remember that the stable cyclohexane ring is not broken during this reduction. If the ring were also broken, the IHD would be 0. This is another potential trap, as '0' is listed as option A.\n3.  **Reagent Knowledge:** The entire solution hinges on knowing the function of Red P + HI as a strong, non-selective reducing agent that completely saturates a molecule's π bonds and removes functional group oxygens while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe initial molecule has an IHD of 5. The exhaustive reduction with Red P and HI removes the four pi bonds but preserves the single ring. This results in a final product with an IHD of 1.\n\nThe provided options are:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 3\nD) 5\n\nThe calculated value of 1 for the product's IHD corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem, incorporating and synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant's Structure and its Initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nFirst, we must understand the structure of the starting molecule, **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**, and calculate its degree of unsaturation, also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-`**: This part of the name indicates a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This suffix indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This is one π bond, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`formyl` group** (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`vinyl` group** (-CH=CH₂): This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group** (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This is one π bond, contributing **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the **reactant** is:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 4 (pi bonds) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and the Reagent**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reagent Function**: This combination is known in organic chemistry as a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent. Its purpose is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) forms.\n*   **Effect on the Molecule**:\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the ring and the one in the vinyl group) will be reduced to single bonds.\n    *   All carbon-oxygen double bonds (in the formyl and carboxylic acid groups) will be completely reduced, and the oxygen atoms will be removed. Effectively, -CHO and -COOH are both reduced to -CH₃.\n    *   Crucially, this reaction is not strong enough to break the stable carbon-carbon single bonds that form the ring structure. Therefore, the cyclohexane ring skeleton is preserved.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction removes all the sources of unsaturation that came from pi bonds but leaves the ring itself untouched.\n\n*   The reactant had 1 ring and 4 pi bonds.\n*   The reaction eliminates all 4 pi bonds.\n*   The resulting product retains the 1 ring.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a fully saturated molecule, meaning it has no pi bonds, but it is still cyclic. We can now calculate its IHD:\n\n*   **Number of rings in the product:** 1\n*   **Number of pi bonds in the product:** 0\n\nThe IHD of the **product** = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reactant vs. Product IHD**: The IHD of the starting material is 5, which matches option (C). This is a common distractor. The question specifically asks for the IHD of the **product**.\n2.  **Ring Preservation**: After the exhaustive reduction removes all pi bonds, one might mistakenly think the IHD is 0. However, the ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation relative to an open-chain molecule with the same number of carbons. The ring is preserved in this reaction, so the IHD cannot be 0. Option (D) is a distractor for this mistake.\n3.  **Reagent Strength**: Recognizing that Red P + HI is a powerful, non-selective reducing agent is key. A weaker or more selective reagent would lead to a different product and thus a different IHD. For instance, if only the C=C bonds were reduced, the two C=O bonds and the ring would remain, giving an IHD of 3. This matches option (A).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the consistent and correct chemical reasoning, the reaction removes the four pi bonds but preserves the single ring. This reduces the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency from 5 to 1. The IHD of the final product is **1**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
