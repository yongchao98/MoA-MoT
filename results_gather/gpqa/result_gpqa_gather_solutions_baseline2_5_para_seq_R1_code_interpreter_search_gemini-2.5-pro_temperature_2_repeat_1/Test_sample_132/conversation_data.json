Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations**\nFirst, we calculate the concentrations of the primary components of the buffer system: the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n*   **Solution Volume:**\n    The volume is 200.00 cm³, which must be converted to Liters for molarity calculations.

Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\nThe [H⁺] is established by the buffer equilibrium, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\n\n*   **Relevant Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   This equilibrium is governed by the second acid dissociation constant, **Kₐ₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸**.\n*   Using the equilibrium expression `Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]`, we can solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ **8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M**\n\n**3. Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\nThe final step is to find the concentration of the target ion, PO₄³⁻. This ion is formed in the third dissociation step, and its concentration is determined by the [H⁺] we just calculated.\n\n*   **Relevant Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   This equilibrium is governed by the third acid dissociation constant, **Kₐ₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²**.\n*   Using the equilibrium expression `Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]`, we can solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ **6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M**\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Use Molar Mass of Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt `Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O` (177.99 g/mol) as provided, not the anhydrous form.\n*   **Correct Kₐ Selection:** The problem must be solved in steps. Kₐ₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] from the main `H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻` buffer. Then, Kₐ₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final `[PO₄³⁻]`. Ka₁ is not used.\n*   **Buffer Approximation:** It is valid to assume that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations, as the extent of further dissociation is very small.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation yields a final concentration for the orthophosphate ion of approximately 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding to three significant figures, this is **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.

The correct approach is to perform the calculation from first principles, paying attention to key details, and then match the final result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem is solved in three main steps.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe solution is a buffer made of the weak acid, dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻), from KH₂PO₄, and its conjugate base, hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻), from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n\n*   **Calculations for H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n*   **Calculations for HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n*   **Final Concentrations:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = **0.03674 M**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = **0.02809 M**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺].**\nThe hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the main buffer equilibrium, which connects the two species calculated in Step 1 and is described by the second acid dissociation constant, Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   The equilibrium expression is Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]. We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ **8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration, [PO₄³⁻].**\nThe concentration of the target ion, PO₄³⁻, is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium. This is a secondary equilibrium whose conditions are set by the [H⁺] concentration we calculated from the main buffer.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   The equilibrium expression is Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻].

Ka₂ (6.2x10⁻⁸) governs the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer and is used to find [H⁺]. Ka₃ (1.8x10⁻¹²) governs the final dissociation to PO₄³⁻ and is used to find the concentration of that ion.

Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\nThe [H⁺] is established by the buffer equilibrium between the weak acid and its conjugate base. This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Kₐ₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Expression:** Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   **Solve for [H⁺]:**\n    [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ **8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M**\n\n**3. Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\nThe final target ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed in the third dissociation step. Its concentration depends on the [H⁺] we just calculated and the third dissociation constant, Kₐ₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Expression:** Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   **Solve for [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ **6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M**\n\n### Careful Points\nTo solve this problem correctly, one must pay attention to several details that were correctly identified by the candidate answers:\n1.  **Volume Conversion:** The solution volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L) for molarity calculations.\n2.  **Molar Mass of the Hydrate:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, 177.99 g/mol) as specified in the problem, not the molar mass of the anhydrous form.\n3.  **Correct Kₐ Selection:** The calculation must be done in a logical order. Kₐ₂ must be used first to find the [H⁺] from the main H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer equilibrium. Then, Kₐ₃ must be used for the subsequent HPO₄²⁻/PO₄³⁻ equilibrium to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculated concentration for the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is approximately 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) confirm that the options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. Therefore, the most reliable strategy is to perform the calculation from first principles, paying attention to critical details, and then match the verified result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem is solved using a three-step equilibrium calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe solution is a buffer created from a weak acid, dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄), and its conjugate base, hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n\nFirst, calculate the moles of each substance:\n*   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻**: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n*   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻**: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\nNext, calculate the concentration in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution:\n*   **[H₂PO₄⁻]** = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n*   **[HPO₄²⁻]** = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺].**\nThe hydrogen ion concentration is established by the primary buffer equilibrium, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻). This is governed by the acid dissociation constant, Kₐ₂.\n\nUsing the equilibrium expression `Kₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]`, we can solve for [H⁺]:\n*   [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ **8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M**\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻].**\nThe target ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed in the third dissociation step (HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻). Its concentration is determined by the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the third acid dissociation constant, Kₐ₃.\n\nUsing the equilibrium expression `Kₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]`, we can solve for our target ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ **6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M**\n\n### Careful Points for Accuracy\n\nAs noted by all successful candidate answers, there are several key points that are crucial for obtaining the correct answer:\n1.  **Volume Conversion**: The solution volume of 200.00 cm³ must be converted to 0.20000 L before calculating molar concentrations.\n2.  **Molar Mass of the Hydrate**: It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, 177.99 g/mol) as specified in the problem, not the molar mass of the anhydrous form.\n3.  **Correct Kₐ Selection**: The problem must be solved sequentially. The [H⁺] is determined first by the main buffer equilibrium (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻), so Kₐ₂ must be used. Then, the [PO₄³⁻] is found from the secondary equilibrium (HPO₄²⁻/PO₄³⁻), which requires Kₐ₃. Ka₁ is not used in this calculation.\n4.  **Buffer Approximation**: The assumption that the equilibrium concentrations of the main buffer components ([H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻]) are equal to their initial concentrations is a valid and standard practice for buffer calculations.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly yields a concentration for the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) of approximately 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding this to three significant figures (to match the precision of the provided options) gives **6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M**.\n\nMatching this confirmed numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the question:\nA) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value is an exact match for option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe solution is a buffer created from a weak acid, dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄), and its conjugate base, hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n\n-   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻**: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n-   **Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻]**: 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n-   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻**: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n-   **Concentration [HPO₄²⁻]**: 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺].**\nThe [H⁺] is established by the buffer equilibrium, which is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by the acid dissociation constant Ka₂.\n\n-   **Equilibrium**: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n-   **Expression**: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n-   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻].**\nThe target ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed in the third dissociation step. Its concentration is determined by the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the third acid dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n\n-   **Equilibrium**: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n-   **Expression**: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n-   Rearranging to solve for the target ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe python code confirms this calculation. The output `6.236e-07` is consistent with the manual derivation.\n\n### Careful Points\nDuring this calculation, several points are critical for accuracy:\n1.  **Volume Conversion**: The solution volume must be converted from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L).\n2.  **Molar Mass of Hydrated Salt**: It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, 177.99 g/mol) as specified, not the anhydrous form.\n3.  **Correct Selection of Ka Values**: The problem involves multiple equilibria. The [H⁺] is determined by the primary buffer components, so Ka₂ (for the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair) must be used. The final [PO₄³⁻] concentration is then found using Ka₃ (for the HPO₄²⁻/PO₄³⁻ pair).\n4.  **Logical Order of Calculation**: The [H⁺] must be calculated first from the main buffer system before it can be used to solve for the concentration of the minor species, PO₄³⁻.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation, verified by the script and supported by the consensus of all candidate agents, shows the concentration of orthophosphate ions to be 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.
