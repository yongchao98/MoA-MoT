The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde is protected using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT).\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the carbon atom between the two electron-withdrawing sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Umpolung):** This is a classic Corey-Seebach reaction, which achieves \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal), transforming the once-electrophilic carbonyl carbon into a nucleophile.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: This is an Sₙ2 alkylation.

The ylide is formed from triphenylphosphine, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. This ylide, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`, then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`). The C=O bond is replaced by a C=C bond.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Symmetric Coupling):** The reaction joins two identical diethyl fragments.\n    *   **Product E**: The final product is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`, systematically named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe number of signals in a ¹³C-NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically unique carbon environments in the molecule.

For geometric isomerism to exist, each carbon atom of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the central carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, there is only one structure to analyze.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry.

An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying chemical principles and the final numerical result.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nThe chemical structure of the final product must be identified by correctly interpreting the five-step reaction sequence. All candidate answers correctly followed this logic:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a thioacetal protection reaction. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde is converted into a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.

The Wittig ylide, formed *in situ* from 3-bromopentane, reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone.\n    *   **Product E**: The reaction joins two identical diethyl fragments `((CH₃CH₂)₂C=)` with a double bond. The final product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments by analyzing the molecular symmetry of **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. A C₂ axis of rotation passes through the center of the C=C double bond, and there is also a center of inversion. This symmetry makes many groups of atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments**: Based on this symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two central carbons of the double bond are in identical chemical environments. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. This gives **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are also in the same chemical environment. This gives **one signal**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  **Umpolung Chemistry**: The reversal of the carbonyl carbon's polarity via a thioacetal is a key concept correctly identified by all agents.\n2.  **Symmetrical Wittig Reaction**: Both the ketone (3-pentanone) and the ylide (from 3-bromopentane) contribute identical `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` fragments, leading to a highly symmetrical product.\n3.  **Lack of E/Z Isomers**: A crucial insight, noted by all agents, is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene cannot have E/Z (geometric) isomers. This is because each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical groups (two ethyl groups), simplifying the analysis to a single structure.\n\nThe sum of unique carbon environments is 1 (alkene) + 1 (methylene) + 1 (methyl) = **3 signals**.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 11\nB) 6\nC) 3\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the problem requires a two-part approach: first, determining the structure of the final product (E) from the provided reaction sequence, and second, analyzing the symmetry of this product to determine the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nLet's systematically trace the chemical transformations through the five-step synthesis:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard **thioacetal protection** reaction.

The Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, PPh₃, and BuLi. This ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃, then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone.

It removes the most acidic proton from A, which is the hydrogen on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. This is a potent nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 substitution reaction. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond, adding a second ethyl group.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These are standard conditions for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of a thioacetal. The protecting group is removed, and the carbonyl group is regenerated. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, a ketone is formed.\n    *   **Product D**: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone), with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction, a method for synthesizing alkenes from carbonyl compounds. First, the reagents form a phosphorus ylide. Then, the ylide reacts with the ketone from step D.\n    *   **Ylide Formation**: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) form a phosphonium salt, which is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   **Wittig Coupling**: The ylide reacts with 3-pentanone (D). The C=O double bond of the ketone is replaced by the C=C double bond from the ylide.\n    *   **Product E**: The reaction couples two identical fragments: (CH₃CH₂)₂C= from the ketone and =(CH₂CH₃)₂ from the ylide. The final product is **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂**, which is systematically named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe number of signals in a ¹³C-NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically distinct carbon environments in a molecule, which is determined by its symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry**:\n    The structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is:\n    ```\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n    This molecule is highly symmetrical.

This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: The symmetry renders all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Following the same logic, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment. This results in **one signal**.\n\nSumming these unique environments gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Umpolung Chemistry**: Recognizing the \"polarity reversal\" in Step 2, where the thioacetal allows the originally electrophilic carbonyl carbon to become a nucleophile, is crucial to understanding the synthesis pathway.\n2.  **Symmetry in Synthesis**: The Wittig reaction in Step 5 couples two identical molecular fragments—one from the ketone and one from the ylide precursor (3-bromopentane). This convergent synthesis naturally leads to a highly symmetrical product.\n3.  **Absence of Stereoisomers**: A critical realization is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene **cannot** have E/Z (geometric) isomers. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the sp²-hybridized carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups, making E/Z isomerism impossible. This simplifies the analysis to a single structure.\n4.  **Symmetry is Key for Spectroscopy**: The final answer depends entirely on correctly analyzing the high degree of symmetry in the final product to determine the number of non-equivalent carbons.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reaction sequence yields the highly symmetrical molecule 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.

This results in **one signal**.\n\nSumming these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Umpolung Chemistry**: The key to the synthesis is recognizing the deprotonation of the thioacetal in step 2 to reverse the polarity of the carbonyl carbon, turning it into a nucleophile.\n2.  **Symmetry in Synthesis**: The Wittig reaction in step 5 combines two identical fragments (one from the ketone D, one from the ylide made from 3-bromopentane), leading to a highly symmetrical final product.\n3.  **Absence of E/Z Isomerism**: A critical point is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene cannot have E/Z (geometric) isomers. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each alkene carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups. This means there is only one possible structure for the product.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe step-by-step synthesis yields 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.

The provided candidate answers are remarkably consistent in their chemical reasoning, although they diverge on the final letter choice due to variations in the options presented to them.\n\n**Part 1: Consensus on the Reaction Pathway and Product Structure**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the structure of the final product, E, by analyzing the five-step reaction sequence. The consensus analysis is as follows:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: Thioacetal protection of propionaldehyde yields **A: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Deprotonation of the acidic proton between the sulfur atoms (a Corey-Seebach reaction or \"Umpolung\") yields **B: a lithiated carbanion**, which is a nucleophile.\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: Sₙ2 alkylation of the carbanion with bromoethane yields **C: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: Hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal regenerates a carbonyl group, yielding **D: 3-pentanone** (diethyl ketone).\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: A Wittig reaction between the ketone (3-pentanone) and the ylide formed from 3-bromopentane. The reaction couples two identical fragments to yield **E: 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\nThe final structure is unambiguously determined to be **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂**.\n\n**Part 2: Consensus on the ¹³C-NMR Analysis**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly analyzed the structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene to determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry**:\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    The key insight, identified by all agents, is that the molecule is **highly symmetrical**. It has a C₂ axis of rotation and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments**: Due to this high symmetry, there are only three chemically distinct types of carbon atoms:\n    1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (`=C<`) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    2.  The four methylene carbons (`-CH₂-`) of the ethyl groups are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    3.  The four methyl carbons (`-CH₃-`) of the ethyl groups are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Total Signals**: The sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\n\n**Careful Points Emphasized by All Agents**:\n\n1.  **Umpolung**: The reversal of polarity in step 2 is a crucial synthetic concept.\n2.  **Wittig Coupling**: Correctly identifying that the Wittig reaction couples two identical fragments (one from the ketone D, one from the 3-bromopentane reagent) is key.\n3.  **Symmetry**: The high symmetry of the final product is the most important factor in determining the number of NMR signals.\n4.  **No E/Z Isomerism**: A critical observation is that E/Z (geometric) isomerism is not possible for 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, as each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical groups (ethyl groups).

The first part is to determine the structure of the final product, E, by carefully analyzing the five-step reaction sequence. The second part is to analyze the symmetry of the final product to determine the number of unique carbon environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nLet's break down the synthesis step-by-step, following the transformation of the starting material.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a protection reaction. The aldehyde functional group of propionaldehyde (`CH₃CH₂CHO`) is protected as a cyclic thioacetal by reacting it with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) using BF₃ as a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from molecule A, which is the proton on the carbon atom located between the two sulfur atoms.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. This species is a potent nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (`CH₃CH₂Br`) in an Sₙ2 substitution reaction. This step forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal group. This process regenerates the carbonyl functional group. Since the deprotected carbon atom is bonded to two ethyl groups, a ketone is formed.\n    *   **Product D**: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone), with the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a Wittig reaction, a classic method for forming an alkene from a carbonyl compound. The reaction first involves the *in situ* formation of a phosphorus ylide from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. This ylide, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`, then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D).\n    *   **Product E**: The reaction couples the carbon frameworks of the ketone and the ylide, replacing the `C=O` bond with a `C=C` bond. The final product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, which has the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon environments by analyzing the molecular symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry**:\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the midpoint of the central `C=C` bond, and also a center of inversion. This symmetry means that all four ethyl groups are chemically identical.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments**:\n    Due to the molecule's high degree of symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two central carbons forming the double bond are in identical chemical environments. They are equivalent and produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Following the same logic, the four terminal methyl carbons of the ethyl groups are also chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\nSumming these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 unique carbon environments**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Umpolung**: The reaction in Step 2, where the polarity of the carbonyl carbon is reversed to create a nucleophile, is a key concept (Corey-Seebach reaction) that is central to the synthesis.\n*   **Wittig Reaction Identity**: Both the ketone (3-pentanone from step D) and the alkyl halide used to make the ylide (3-bromopentane) provide the same `(CH₃CH₂)₂C` fragment, leading to a highly symmetrical product.\n*   **Absence of E/Z Isomerism**: A critical point is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene cannot have E/Z (geometric) isomers. For isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the sp² carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, there is only one structure to consider.\n*   **Symmetry**: The final answer depends entirely on correctly identifying the high degree of symmetry in the final product.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final product E has 3 unique carbon environments and will thus produce 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, deducing the structure of the final product, E, from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing the symmetry of E to determine the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nThe structure of the final product, E, is determined by systematically analyzing the five-step reaction sequence. All provided candidate answers have correctly deduced the pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This is a thioacetal protection of the aldehyde. Product **A** is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   This is a deprotonation reaction using the strong base BuLi. The acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is removed. This step is a classic \"Umpolung\" (polarity reversal) reaction. Product **B** is the **lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group. Product **C** is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is a deprotection step, hydrolyzing the thioacetal back to a carbonyl group. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, Product **D** is the ketone **3-pentanone**.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from PPh₃, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. The ylide is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`. This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`), to form an alkene. Product **E** is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon environments in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene by analyzing its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    The molecule is highly symmetrical, possessing a C₂ rotational axis through the center of the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The symmetry renders all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment. This results in **one signal**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Reaction Identification:** It is critical to correctly identify each reaction type, particularly the Umpolung deprotonation and the Wittig reaction.\n2.  **Symmetry in Synthesis:** The Wittig reaction couples two identical fragments (`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=`), leading to a highly symmetrical product.\n3.  **Lack of Stereoisomerism:** A crucial point is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene **cannot** have E/Z isomers. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each alkene carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups, making stereoisomerism impossible.\n4.  **Final Count:** The high degree of symmetry is the key to the final answer. The 10 carbon atoms in the molecule are grouped into only 3 chemically distinct sets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of unique carbon environments in the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**. Therefore, its ¹³C-NMR spectrum will exhibit 3 signals.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 3\nB) 11\nC) 8\nD) 6\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, deducing the structure of the final product, E, from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing the symmetry of E to determine the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.

The very strong base, Butyllithium (BuLi), removes the acidic proton from the carbon located between the two sulfur atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Umpolung):** This is a key synthetic strategy known as \"umpolung\" or the Corey-Seebach reaction. It reverses the normal electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon, turning it into a potent nucleophile (carbanion).\n    *   **Product B:** The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   **Reaction:** Sₙ2 Alkylation.

The thioacetal is hydrolyzed, regenerating a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** Since the deprotected carbon is bonded to two ethyl groups, the product is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone**.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   **Reaction:** Wittig Reaction. This step forms an alkene from a ketone.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Ylide Formation):** The reagents first form a phosphorus ylide. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane (`(CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr`) react, and subsequent deprotonation by BuLi yields the ylide `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`.\n    *   **Reaction Coupling:** The ylide reacts with the ketone from the previous step, 3-pentanone (`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`). The `C=O` bond is replaced by a `C=C` bond, effectively coupling two identical `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` fragments.\n    *   **Final Product E:** The product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments by analyzing the molecular symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Symmetry):** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a center of symmetry and a C₂ rotational axis passing through the midpoint of the central `C=C` bond. This high degree of symmetry renders many atoms and groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Stereoisomerism):** E/Z (or geometric) isomerism is **not possible** for this molecule. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the sp² carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, there is only one possible structure for product E.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The symmetry also makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other.

The first part involves deducing the structure of the final product, E, from the provided five-step reaction sequence. The second part is to analyze the symmetry of product E to determine the number of unique carbon environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nLet's systematically trace the transformation of the starting material through each reaction step.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard thioacetal protection reaction. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde is converted into a cyclic thioacetal using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT).\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms is acidic because the resulting negative charge (carbanion) is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Umpolung):** This is a key step known as a Corey-Seebach reaction. It accomplishes an \"umpolung,\" or reversal of polarity, turning the carbon atom that was originally the electrophilic center of the aldehyde into a potent nucleophile.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane, forming a new C-C bond.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These are standard conditions for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of a thioacetal. The C-S bonds are cleaved, and the carbonyl group is regenerated.\n    *   **Product D**: Since the protected carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is **3-pentanone** (also known as diethyl ketone).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a Wittig reaction, a method for synthesizing alkenes from carbonyl compounds.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Ylide Formation):** The Wittig reagent (a phosphorus ylide) is first formed *in situ*. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane, and the resulting phosphonium salt is deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   **Product E:** This ylide reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by the C=C bond from the ylide. The reaction joins two identical fragments, yielding **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂**.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by analyzing the molecular symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Symmetry):** The molecule is highly symmetrical.

This high degree of symmetry renders many atoms and groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Stereoisomerism):** E/Z (or geometric) isomerism is **not possible** for this molecule. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. In this molecule, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical ethyl groups, making E/Z isomers impossible. There is only one unique structure for the final product.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    Due to the molecule's high symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two central carbons of the double bond are in identical chemical environments. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The four ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment. This results in **one signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of distinct carbon environments is 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will exhibit 3 signals.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 8\nB) 11\nC) 3\nD) 6\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product, E, by analyzing the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing the symmetry of the final product to determine the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nThe structure of E is determined by carefully following the five-step reaction sequence.

The protecting group is removed by hydrolysis, regenerating a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone**.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   **Reaction:** Wittig reaction. This step synthesizes an alkene from the ketone (D). The phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃, then reacts with 3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n    *   **Product E:** The reaction couples two identical fragments, yielding **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe number of signals in a ¹³C-NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically distinct carbon environments in the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    The final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is a highly symmetrical molecule. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the center of the double bond and a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Symmetry Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's high symmetry, all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Absence of Stereoisomers:** E/Z (or geometric) isomerism is not possible for this molecule. For stereoisomerism to exist across a double bond, each carbon of the bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the two alkene carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups.

Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, a ketone is formed.\n    *   **Product D**: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone), with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction, a method for synthesizing alkenes from carbonyl compounds. First, the reagents form a phosphorus ylide. Then, the ylide reacts with the ketone from step D.\n    *   **Ylide Formation**: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) form a phosphonium salt, which is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   **Wittig Coupling**: The ylide reacts with 3-pentanone (D).

This results in **one signal**.\n\nSumming these unique environments gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Umpolung Chemistry**: Recognizing the \"polarity reversal\" in Step 2, where the thioacetal allows the originally electrophilic carbonyl carbon to become a nucleophile, is crucial to understanding the synthesis pathway.\n2.  **Symmetry in Synthesis**: The Wittig reaction in Step 5 couples two identical molecular fragments—one from the ketone and one from the ylide precursor (3-bromopentane). This convergent synthesis naturally leads to a highly symmetrical product.\n3.  **Absence of Stereoisomers**: A critical realization is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene **cannot** have E/Z (geometric) isomers. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups.

The first part is to determine the structure of the final product, E, by carefully analyzing the five-step reaction sequence. The second part is to analyze the symmetry of the final product to determine the number of unique carbon environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nLet's break down the synthesis step-by-step, following the transformation of the starting material.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a protection reaction. The aldehyde functional group of propionaldehyde (`CH₃CH₂CHO`) is protected as a cyclic thioacetal by reacting it with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) using BF₃ as a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from molecule A, which is the proton on the carbon atom located between the two sulfur atoms.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. This species is a potent nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (`CH₃CH₂Br`) in an Sₙ2 substitution reaction. This step forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal group. This process regenerates the carbonyl functional group. Since the deprotected carbon atom is bonded to two ethyl groups, a ketone is formed.\n    *   **Product D**: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone), with the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a Wittig reaction, a classic method for forming an alkene from a carbonyl compound. The reaction first involves the *in situ* formation of a phosphorus ylide from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. This ylide, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`, then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D).\n    *   **Product E**: The reaction couples the carbon frameworks of the ketone and the ylide, replacing the `C=O` bond with a `C=C` bond. The final product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, which has the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon environments by analyzing the molecular symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry**:\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the midpoint of the central `C=C` bond, and also a center of inversion. This symmetry means that all four ethyl groups are chemically identical.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments**:\n    Due to the molecule's high degree of symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two central carbons forming the double bond are in identical chemical environments. They are equivalent and produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Following the same logic, the four terminal methyl carbons of the ethyl groups are also chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\nSumming these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 unique carbon environments**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Umpolung**: The reaction in Step 2, where the polarity of the carbonyl carbon is reversed to create a nucleophile, is a key concept (Corey-Seebach reaction) that is central to the synthesis.\n*   **Wittig Reaction Identity**: Both the ketone (3-pentanone from step D) and the alkyl halide used to make the ylide (3-bromopentane) provide the same `(CH₃CH₂)₂C` fragment, leading to a highly symmetrical product.\n*   **Absence of E/Z Isomerism**: A critical point is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene cannot have E/Z (geometric) isomers. For isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the sp² carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, there is only one structure to consider.\n*   **Symmetry**: The final answer depends entirely on correctly identifying the high degree of symmetry in the final product.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final product E has 3 unique carbon environments and will thus produce 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, deducing the structure of the final product, E, from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing the symmetry of E to determine the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nThe structure of the final product, E, is determined by systematically analyzing the five-step reaction sequence. All provided candidate answers have correctly deduced the pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This is a thioacetal protection of the aldehyde. Product **A** is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   This is a deprotonation reaction using the strong base BuLi. The acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is removed. This step is a classic \"Umpolung\" (polarity reversal) reaction. Product **B** is the **lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group. Product **C** is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is a deprotection step, hydrolyzing the thioacetal back to a carbonyl group. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, Product **D** is the ketone **3-pentanone**.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from PPh₃, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. The ylide is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`. This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`), to form an alkene. Product **E** is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically unique carbon environments in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene by analyzing its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    The molecule is highly symmetrical, possessing a C₂ rotational axis through the center of the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The symmetry renders all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment. This results in **one signal**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Reaction Identification:** It is critical to correctly identify each reaction type, particularly the Umpolung deprotonation and the Wittig reaction.\n2.  **Symmetry in Synthesis:** The Wittig reaction couples two identical fragments (`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=`), leading to a highly symmetrical product.\n3.  **Lack of Stereoisomerism:** A crucial point is that 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene **cannot** have E/Z isomers. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each alkene carbon is attached to two identical ethyl groups, making stereoisomerism impossible.\n4.  **Final Count:** The high degree of symmetry is the key to the final answer. The 10 carbon atoms in the molecule are grouped into only 3 chemically distinct sets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of unique carbon environments in the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**. Therefore, its ¹³C-NMR spectrum will exhibit 3 signals.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 3\nB) 11\nC) 8\nD) 6\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, deducing the structure of the final product, E, from the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing the symmetry of E to determine the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum. A consistent analysis across all candidate answers provides a clear path to the solution.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through five distinct steps, each transforming the molecule towards the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   **Reaction:** Protection of an aldehyde. The carbonyl group of propionaldehyde (`CH₃CH₂CHO`) is converted to a cyclic thioacetal using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT).\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   **Reaction:** Deprotonation. The very strong base, Butyllithium (BuLi), removes the acidic proton from the carbon located between the two sulfur atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Umpolung):** This is a key synthetic strategy known as \"umpolung\" or the Corey-Seebach reaction. It reverses the normal electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon, turning it into a potent nucleophile (carbanion).\n    *   **Product B:** The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   **Reaction:** Sₙ2 Alkylation. The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane, forming a new C-C bond and adding a second ethyl group.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   **Reaction:** Deprotection. The thioacetal is hydrolyzed, regenerating a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** Since the deprotected carbon is bonded to two ethyl groups, the product is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone**.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   **Reaction:** Wittig Reaction. This step forms an alkene from a ketone.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Ylide Formation):** The reagents first form a phosphorus ylide. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane (`(CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr`) react, and subsequent deprotonation by BuLi yields the ylide `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`.\n    *   **Reaction Coupling:** The ylide reacts with the ketone from the previous step, 3-pentanone (`(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`). The `C=O` bond is replaced by a `C=C` bond, effectively coupling two identical `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` fragments.\n    *   **Final Product E:** The product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments by analyzing the molecular symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Symmetry):** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a center of symmetry and a C₂ rotational axis passing through the midpoint of the central `C=C` bond. This high degree of symmetry renders many atoms and groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Stereoisomerism):** E/Z (or geometric) isomerism is **not possible** for this molecule. For E/Z isomerism to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the sp² carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, there is only one possible structure for product E.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The symmetry also makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment. This results in **one signal**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSumming the unique environments gives a total of 1 (alkene) + 1 (methylene) + 1 (methyl) = **3 signals**. This means the ¹³C-NMR spectrum for the final product E will show 3 distinct signals.

There is only one unique structure for the final product.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    Due to the molecule's high symmetry:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two central carbons of the double bond are in identical chemical environments. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The four ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment. This results in **one signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of distinct carbon environments is 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will exhibit 3 signals.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 8\nB) 11\nC) 3\nD) 6\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis: first, determining the structure of the final product, E, by analyzing the multi-step synthesis, and second, analyzing the symmetry of the final product to determine the number of signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nThe structure of E is determined by carefully following the five-step reaction sequence. All provided candidate answers correctly trace this pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   **Reaction:** Thioacetal protection. The aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   **Reaction:** Deprotonation / Umpolung. The strong base butyllithium (BuLi) removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, an example of polarity reversal (\"umpolung\").\n    *   **Product B:** The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   **Reaction:** Sₙ2 Alkylation. The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane, adding a second ethyl group to the central carbon.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   **Reaction:** Thioacetal Deprotection. The protecting group is removed by hydrolysis, regenerating a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone**.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   **Reaction:** Wittig reaction. This step synthesizes an alkene from the ketone (D). The phosphorus ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃, then reacts with 3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n    *   **Product E:** The reaction couples two identical fragments, yielding **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n### **Part 2: ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe number of signals in a ¹³C-NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically distinct carbon environments in the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    The final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is a highly symmetrical molecule. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the center of the double bond and a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Symmetry Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's high symmetry, all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Absence of Stereoisomers:** E/Z (or geometric) isomerism is not possible for this molecule. For stereoisomerism to exist across a double bond, each carbon of the bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the two alkene carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups. Therefore, there is only one possible structure for the product.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to symmetry. This gives **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSumming the unique environments gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\nBased on the provided options in the prompt (A) 3, B) 8, C) 6, D) 11), the correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deduction of the Final Product Structure (E)**\n\nThe initial and most critical task is to determine the chemical structure of the final product, E, by correctly interpreting the five-step reaction sequence. All provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on this multi-step synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Carbonyl protection. Propionaldehyde's aldehyde group (CH₃CH₂CHO) is converted into a cyclic thioacetal using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT).\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Deprotonation / Umpolung. Butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms. This classic Corey-Seebach reaction inverts the polarity (\"Umpolung\") of the original carbonyl carbon, turning it into a potent nucleophile.\n    *   **Product B:** The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic Substitution (Sₙ2). The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic bromoethane, adding a second ethyl group to the carbon center.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Deprotection. The thioacetal group is hydrolyzed, regenerating a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** Since the original carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, a ketone is formed: **3-pentanone** (diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Wittig Reaction. This step converts the ketone (D) into an alkene. First, the Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, PPh₃, and BuLi, yielding `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`. This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone. The C=O bond is replaced by a C=C bond.\n    *   **Product E:** The reaction couples two identical fragments, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=`, to form **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`.\n\n**2. 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe number of signals in a ¹³C-NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically distinct carbon environments in the molecule. This is determined by analyzing the molecular symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the midpoint of the central C=C bond. This high degree of symmetry makes many of the atoms and groups chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The symmetry also makes all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in the same chemical environment. They will produce **one signal**.\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Correctly Identified Reactions:** The analysis hinges on correctly identifying the full sequence of reactions: thioacetal protection, umpolung, alkylation, deprotection, and the Wittig reaction.\n*   **Symmetry of Final Product:** The most crucial element for answering the specific question is recognizing the high degree of symmetry in the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n*   **Absence of E/Z Isomerism:** A key insight, noted by all candidate solutions, is that E/Z (geometric) isomerism is **not possible** for this molecule. For stereoisomers to exist, each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two *different* groups. Here, each of the sp² carbons is attached to two identical ethyl groups, simplifying the analysis to a single structure.\n\nSumming the unique environments gives a total of 1 (alkene C) + 1 (methylene C) + 1 (methyl C) = **3 signals**.\n\nMatching this numerical answer to the given options:\nA) 6\nB) 8\nC) 3\nD) 11\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
