    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other (m1 = 2*m2). The sum of the rest-masses of these fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) when calculated using relativistic versus classical mechanics.\n\nFirst, we define the helper logic to perform these calculations and write tests to verify the logic based on the problem's constraints. The primary test case will use the values from the question, expecting a result of 5 MeV, which corresponds to one of the provided options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_t1_difference(initial_rest_mass_energy_gev, mass_ratio, final_mass_fraction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy \n    for the more massive fragment in a fission process.\n\n    The calculation proceeds as follows:\n    1.  Determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (E1_rest, E2_rest) from the initial conditions.\n    2.  Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value) from the conservation of energy.\n    3.  Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) using the classical approximation.\n        In classical mechanics, momentum p=mv, and kinetic energy T=1/2*mv^2. Conservation of momentum\n        leads to the kinetic energies being inversely proportional to the masses (T1/T2 = m2/m1).\n    4.  Calculate T1 using the correct relativistic formulas. In relativity, the energy-momentum\n        relation is E_total^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. Conservation of momentum (p1=p2) allows us to\n        solve for the individual kinetic energies.\n    5.
