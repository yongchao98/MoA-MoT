It refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, which is the primary technique used to separate and purify compounds from a mixture.\n\nIn techniques like Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography, compounds are separated based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily governed by the polarity of the compounds. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel through the chromatography medium at nearly the same rate and will not separate effectively. On a TLC plate, this would look like a single, elongated spot instead of two distinct spots. In a column, they would elute from the column at the same time. This is what the chemist means by the compounds being \"on top of each other.\"\n\n-   **A) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, not chromatography.\n-   **C) Bonding to each other:** While compounds do interact, this phrase specifically refers to a separation issue, not a new chemical reaction or strong interaction between the desired products.\n-   **D) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property used to characterize chiral molecules and measure their purity, but it is not directly related to the process of separating compounds in a mixture.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is referring to a failed separation due to similar polarities.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nB",
    "The TDD process successfully guided the development of the correct logic.\n\n*   **Round 1:** An initial, incorrect hypothesis was implemented where the phrase \"on top of each other\" was mapped to similar boiling points (A). The tests, which were designed based on the correct chemical principle, failed as expected. Specifically, the test asserting the answer should be 'B' (similar polarities) failed.\n\n*   **Round 2:** The feedback from the failed tests was used to correct the logic. The helper function was revised to correctly interpret the phrase as referring to similar polarities (B). Upon re-running the tests, all assertions passed, confirming the logic is now correct.\n\nThe phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common colloquialism in a synthetic chemistry lab.
