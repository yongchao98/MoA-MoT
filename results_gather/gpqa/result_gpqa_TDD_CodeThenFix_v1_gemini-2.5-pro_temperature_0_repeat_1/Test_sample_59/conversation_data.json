    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, $\\Delta t_0$) will be shorter than the time observed from Earth ($\\Delta t$) due to their high velocity.\n\nThe solution requires a function to calculate this proper time based on the distance of the journey and the spacecraft's velocity. The tests will verify this calculation against the problem's specific values and constraints.\n\n### Round 1: Initial Logic and Tests\n\nThis block defines the function `calculate_proper_time` which implements the time dilation formula. It includes tests to verify the core physics calculation, check if the astronaut survives the trip (disproving option B), and confirm that the calculated journey duration matches one of the given multiple-choice answers. The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is taken as approximately 158,200 light-years, a standard value that aligns with one of the provided options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_proper_time(distance_ly, v_fraction_c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the proper time for a journey using the time dilation formula.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_ly (float): The distance in light-years.\n        v_fraction_c (float): The velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, c.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The proper time (time experienced by the traveler) in years.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (0 <= v_fraction_c < 1):\n        raise ValueError(\"Velocity must be a fraction between 0 and 1.\")\n\n    # 1.

This value rounds to 81 years. The astronaut's age upon arrival would be $22 + 81 = 103$ years, which is within their 150-year lifespan.\n\n<<<C>>>",
