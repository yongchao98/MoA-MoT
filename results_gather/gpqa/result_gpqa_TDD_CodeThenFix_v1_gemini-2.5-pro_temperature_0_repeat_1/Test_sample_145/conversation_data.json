    "This is a Diels-Alder reaction. The major product is determined by stereochemical principles: the endo rule and syn/anti selectivity. The endo product is favored due to secondary orbital overlap. For the substituent on the C5 carbon of the diene, the *anti* orientation is sterically favored over the *syn* orientation. Therefore, the major product is the endo-anti adduct. In the IUPAC name, the *anti* configuration is denoted by the descriptor 'r' for the substituent on the bridge (position 8). This eliminates options A and C, which are *syn* ('s'). Options B and D are both endo-anti products (they are enantiomers). Both represent the correct structure of the major product.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Helper logic with an intentional flaw for the TDD process.\n# The flaw is in assuming the 'syn' product is major.\ndef get_diels_alder_stereochemistry(diene, dienophile):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the stereochemistry of a Diels-Alder reaction product.\n    Initial (flawed) implementation for Round 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # (a) Helper Logic\n    # The endo rule dictates the anhydride ring tucks under the diene system.\n    # This is generally correct for kinetic products.\n    cycloaddition_mode = 'endo'\n    \n    # For the substituent on the C5 bridge, there's syn/anti selectivity.\n    # FLAW: Let's incorrectly assume 'syn' is favored, perhaps due to a\n    # mistaken idea about electronic attraction.

The stereochemistry of the major product is governed by two main principles:\n\n1.  **The Endo Rule**: For kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes, the *endo* product is favored. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital overlap between the p-orbitals of the diene and the dienophile. All four options provided are *endo* products, so this rule helps confirm the general structure but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n2.  **Syn/Anti Selectivity**: The substituent on the C5 carbon of the cyclopentadiene (the fluorine atom) can result in two different product isomers: *syn* (where the fluorine is on the same side as the new carbon-carbon double bond) or *anti* (where the fluorine is on the opposite side). The *anti* product is the major product because it is sterically favored. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) approaches the diene from the face opposite the bulky fluorine atom to minimize steric repulsion.\n\nThe IUPAC nomenclature for these bridged systems uses the stereodescriptors 's' for *syn* and 'r' for *anti* to describe the substituent on the bridge (position 8). Since the major product is the *anti* isomer, we are looking for an option with the `8r` descriptor.\n\n*   Options A and C have the `8s` descriptor, indicating they are the minor *syn* products.\n*   Options B and D have the `8r` descriptor, indicating they are the major *anti* products.\n\nOptions B and D are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral reactants, it produces a racemic mixture of both enantiomers. In a multiple-choice format, either one represents the correct structure of the major product. Option B is listed.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "The TDD process successfully identified the key stereochemical principle for determining the major product of this Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n*   **Round 1:** The initial code correctly identified that the reaction follows the *endo rule* but incorrectly assumed the *syn* product was favored. The tests failed because they were correctly written to assert that the major product should be the *anti* isomer, which is sterically favored.\n*   **Round 2:** The code was corrected by changing the `substituent_orientation` from `'syn'` to `'anti'`. This fix reflects the correct chemical principle: the dienophile (maleic anhydride) approaches the diene from the face opposite the fluorine substituent to minimize steric hindrance. With this correction, all tests passed, confirming the logic for predicting the major product is sound.\n\n**Chemical Explanation:**\n\nThe reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride is a Diels-Alder reaction. The stereochemistry of the major product is determined by:\n1.  **The Endo Rule:** The reaction favors the *endo* adduct, where the anhydride group is tucked under the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n2.  **Syn/Anti Selectivity:** The dienophile approaches the diene from the side opposite the fluorine atom to minimize steric repulsion. This is known as the *anti* approach.\n\nIn the IUPAC nomenclature for these bridged systems, the *anti* orientation of the substituent at position 8 is denoted by the stereodescriptor 'r'. Therefore, the major product will have '8r' in its name. This eliminates options A and C ('8s'). Options B and D are enantiomers of each other, both representing the correct *endo-anti* product. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, it produces a racemic mixture of these two enantiomers. Option B is one of these correct structures.\n\n<<<B>>>"
