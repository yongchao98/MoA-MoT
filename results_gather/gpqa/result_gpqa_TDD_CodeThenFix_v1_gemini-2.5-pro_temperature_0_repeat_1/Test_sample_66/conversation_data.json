    "Answering this question requires applying the rules of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics, specifically the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nThe total angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This means the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$.\n\nWe are interested in the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum for each electron. The measurement outcome we are testing for is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to the individual quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nA fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check if this condition is met for the desired measurement outcome:\n- The system's state has $m = -1$.\n- The desired measurement outcome has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n- The sum for the desired outcome is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince the system's $m$ value ($-1$) is not equal to the sum of the measured $m$ values ($-2$), it is impossible to obtain this result. The probability of an impossible event is 0.\n\nThe coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is a superposition of states where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. Specifically, for coupling two $l=1$ particles, the state is:\n$|2, -1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |m_1=0, m_2=-1\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |m_1=-1, m_2=0\\rangle$\n\nAs you can see, the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is not a component of the $|2, -1\\rangle$ state, so its corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n\nThe correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An elegant explanation of the physics principles involved, supported by a clear, step-by-step derivation. The conclusion is well-reasoned and directly addresses the user's question.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\nThe user's question asks for the joint probability of measuring specific z-components of angular momentum ($L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$) for a two-electron system in a given coupled state. The solution relies on a fundamental conservation law in quantum mechanics: the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n1.  **Identify System State:** The system is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This means the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its projection on the z-axis is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Identify Measurement Outcome:** We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $m_z\\hbar$ for the z-component of angular momentum corresponds to the quantum number $m_z$. Therefore, the desired measurement outcome is for electron 1 to have $m_1 = -1$ and for electron 2 to have $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Law:** In angular momentum coupling, the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the system's state.\n    *   System's total $m = -1$.\n    *   Sum of desired measured components: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the system's total $m$ (which is -1) is not equal to the sum required by the measurement outcome (-2), this outcome violates the conservation of angular momentum. An event that violates a fundamental conservation law is impossible and has a probability of zero.\n\nThe coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is a superposition of states where $m_1+m_2$ always equals -1. Specifically, it is composed of the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1\\rangle$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0\\rangle$. The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is not part of this superposition, hence the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
