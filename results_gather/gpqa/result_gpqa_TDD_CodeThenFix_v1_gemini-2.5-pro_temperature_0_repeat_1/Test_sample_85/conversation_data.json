    "This problem requires understanding the selectivity of different reducing agents and how stereochemistry is preserved in reactions that don't involve the chiral center.\n\n- **Reagent 1: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)** is a mild reducing agent. It will reduce esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it will not reduce carboxylic acids.\n- **Reagent 2: BH₃ (Borane)** is a strong reducing agent that is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids. It is less reactive towards esters.\n\n**Analysis of Reactions:**\n\nThe starting materials are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COO-isobutyl`) at the other. The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, which has an ethyl group.\n\n1.  **Reaction A:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`\n    - `LiBH₄` will selectively reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    - `(R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` → `(R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    - Subsequent acid workup (`H⁺`) causes the molecule to cyclize (lactonization) into a 6-membered ring.\n    - The reaction does not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product lactone is the same as the starting material.\n    - To get an `(R)` product, starting material `A` must be the `(R)` isomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction B:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`\n    - `BH₃` will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n    - `(R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` → `(R/S)-HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    - Subsequent acid workup (`H⁺`) causes the molecule to cyclize (transesterification) into the same 6-membered lactone.\n    - This reaction also does not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is preserved.\n    - To get an `(S)` product, starting material `B` must be the `(S)` isomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Starting material A is `(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n- Starting material B is `(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nNow, let's use the TDD agent to verify this logic.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef predict_product(starting_material_name: str, reagent: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the lactone product from a starting material and a reagent.\n    \n    This initial version contains a deliberate logical error for TDD demonstration:\n    it incorrectly assumes that BH3 causes an inversion of stereochemistry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Extracts (R) or (S) from a name like \"(R)-3-ethyl...\"\n    match = re.search(r'\\(([RS])\\)', starting_material_name)\n    start_stereo = match.group(1) if match else None\n    \n    if not start_stereo:\n        raise ValueError(\"Could not determine stereochemistry of starting material.\")\n\n    # --- Buggy Logic ---\n    # The chemical principle is that stereochemistry is preserved.\n    # Let's incorrectly model that BH3 inverts it.\n    if reagent == \"BH3\":\n        # Incorrectly invert the stereochemistry for BH3 reaction\n        product_stereo = \"R\" if start_stereo == \"S\" else \"S\"\n    else: # For LiBH4\n        # Correctly preserve stereochemistry\n        product_stereo = start_stereo\n        \n    return f\"({product_stereo})-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\"\n\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"Runs tests based on the problem's constraints and prints a report.\"\"\"\n    passed_tests = []\n    failed_tests = []\n\n    # Test Case A: Based on our hypothesis that A is the (R) isomer.\n    # A + LiBH4 ---> (R)-lactone\n    a_candidate = \"(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\"\n    expected_a = \"(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\"\n    actual_a = predict_product(a_candidate, \"LiBH4\")\n    try:\n        assert actual_a == expected_a\n        passed_tests.append(\"Test A: (R)-acid + LiBH4 -> (R)-lactone\")\n    except AssertionError:\n        failed_tests.append(f\"Test A: FAILED.

    "The TDD process successfully validated the chemical analysis of the reactions.\n\n*   **Initial Analysis & Test Formulation**: The core chemical principle is that neither reduction reaction (`LiBH₄` on the ester or `BH₃` on the carboxylic acid) affects the chiral center.
