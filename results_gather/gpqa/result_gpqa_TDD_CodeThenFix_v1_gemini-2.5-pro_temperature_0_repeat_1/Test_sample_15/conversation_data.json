Despite having two stereocenters, it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It is **not** optically active.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule (the other being 2S,3S). It lacks internal symmetry and is chiral. It is **optically active**.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)` designation indicates a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. It is **optically active**.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule is highly symmetrical and achiral, despite having stereocenters. It is **not** optically active.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule is achiral as it has no stereocenters.
