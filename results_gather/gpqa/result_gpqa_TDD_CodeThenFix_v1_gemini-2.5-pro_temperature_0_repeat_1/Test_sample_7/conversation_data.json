This means its knockout phenotype will mask the phenotype of the downstream gene knockouts.\n    *   The `g2` single mutant has 0% resistance.\n    *   The `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants also have 0% resistance.\n    *   Since the `g2` phenotype is identical to the double-mutant phenotypes, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This strongly indicates that **G2 is an upstream transcription factor** that regulates both G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the G1-G3 Interaction:** To understand how G1 and G3 interact, we compare their single mutant effects to the double mutant effect.\n    *   `g1` knockout causes a 25% loss of resistance (100% -> 75%).\n    *   `g3` knockout causes a 50% loss of resistance (100% -> 50%).\n    *   If their effects were additive, the `g1g3` double mutant would have a 75% loss of resistance (25% + 50%), resulting in 25% remaining resistance.\n    *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance. This effect is much more severe than a simple additive effect, which is a classic sign of a synergistic interaction. This type of interaction is characteristic of **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or overlapping functions, and the loss of both is significantly more detrimental than the loss of either one alone.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrectly claims G3 is epistatic to G1.\n    *   B) Incorrectly claims G1 is epistatic to G3 and uses the term \"pleiotropy\" incorrectly to describe a gene-gene interaction.\n    *   C) Incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor.\n    *   D) Correctly identifies **G2 as the transcription factor** and correctly describes the G1-G3 interaction as **gene redundancy**. While its final claim that \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is contradicted by the data (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the `g1` phenotype of 75%), this option aligns best with the two most significant conclusions from the experiment.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn from the provided data.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nD",
    "All tests passed in the initial round, indicating the logic correctly interpreted the experimental data. No code revision is necessary.\n\n### Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis of the genetic experiment leads to the following conclusions:\n\n1.  **G2 is an upstream transcription factor:** The phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotypes of the `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants (both 0% resistance). This demonstrates that the `g2` mutation is epistatic to (masks the effects of) both `g1` and `g3` mutations. This is a classic genetic signature of a gene (G2) acting upstream in a regulatory pathway, such as a transcription factor required for the expression of downstream genes (G1 and G3).\n\n2.  **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:** To analyze the interaction between G1 and G3, we compare the individual effects with the combined effect.\n    *   Loss of G1 function (`g1` mutant) causes a 25% drop in resistance (from 100% to 75%).\n    *   Loss of G3 function (`g3` mutant) causes a 50% drop in resistance (from 100% to 50%).\n    *   If the genes acted independently in separate pathways, the expected resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant would be additive: 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the observed resistance of the `g1g3` mutant is only 10%. This much more severe phenotype (a 90% drop in resistance) is a synergistic effect, which indicates that G1 and G3 have redundant or overlapping functions. The organism can compensate for the loss of one, but the loss of both is far more detrimental than the sum of their individual losses.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. G3 is not epistatic to G1 (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is different from the `g3` phenotype of 50%).\n    *   B) Incorrect. G1 is not epistatic to G3 (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is different from the `g1` phenotype of 75%). \"Pleiotropy\" refers to one gene affecting multiple traits, not the interaction between two genes.\n    *   C) Incorrect. G1 is not the transcription factor; G2 is.\n    *   D) **Most accurate.** This option correctly identifies that **G2 is a transcription factor** and that **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**. Although the final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on the data, this option contains the two most significant and correct conclusions derived from the experiment, making it the best choice among the alternatives.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nD",
    "### Summary of Analysis\n\nThe experimental data allows for a clear deduction of the genetic relationships between G1, G2, and G3.\n\n1.  **G2 is an Upstream Transcription Factor:** The phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` and `g3` mutants when in a double-mutant combination (`g1g2` and `g2g3` also have 0% resistance). This phenomenon, known as epistasis, is a classic indicator that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3 in a regulatory pathway, consistent with the function of a transcription factor required for their expression.\n\n2.  **G1 and G3 Show Gene Redundancy:** The individual knockouts of `g1` and `g3` result in resistance drops of 25% and 50%, respectively. If their effects were simply additive, the `g1g3` double mutant would be expected to have 25% resistance (100% - 25% - 50%). However, the observed resistance is only 10%. This much more severe effect is synergistic and points to gene redundancy, where G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. The loss of both genes is significantly more detrimental than the sum of their individual losses.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy. Option D is the only choice that correctly identifies both of these key relationships. While its final clause about G1 being epistatic to G3 is incorrect (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g1` phenotype of 75%), it remains the best overall conclusion among the given options.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nD"
