    "Answering this question requires a two-step chemical analysis: first, deducing the structure of the reaction product from the provided NMR data, and second, determining which of the potential starting materials (Compound X) would yield this product under the given reaction conditions.\n\n1.  **Product Identification**: The NMR data points to a specific structure. The 13C NMR signal at δ 197.7 indicates a ketone. The 1H NMR shows two methyl singlets (δ 2.28, 2.31), and a pattern of aromatic protons (two doublets of 2H each) characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. Combining these pieces suggests the product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, also known as (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its formula is C11H12O, which matches the starting material, confirming the reaction is an isomerization.\n\n2.  **Reactant Identification**: The reaction is an isomerization of Compound X (C11H12O) to 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. We must find which option for X fits.\n    *   The product contains a *p-tolyl* (4-methylphenyl) group. Therefore, the starting material must also contain this group.\n    *   Option A, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, contains a p-tolyl group and has the correct formula, C11H12O.\n    *   Option B, 2-styrylepoxide, has the wrong formula (C10H10O).\n    *   Options C and D both have the correct formula (C11H12O) but contain a simple phenyl group, not the required p-tolyl group.\n    *   Therefore, only option A has the correct formula and carbon skeleton to form the identified product. The reaction itself, a base/heat-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is a chemically plausible transformation.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef deduce_product_features(h_nmr, c_nmr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes NMR data to deduce key structural features of the product.\n    This function implements the logic of interpreting the spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n    features = {\n        'formula_C': 0,\n        'formula_H': 0,\n        'has_ketone': False,\n        'has_p_tolyl_skeleton': False,\n    }\n\n    # Analyze 1H NMR for Hydrogen count and specific groups\n    h_count = 0\n    methyl_singlets = 0\n    para_substituted_protons = 0\n    for shift, (integration, multiplicity) in h_nmr.items():\n        h_count += integration\n        if multiplicity == 's' and 1.5 < shift < 2.5:\n            methyl_singlets += 1\n        if multiplicity == 'd' and integration == 2 and 6.5 < shift < 8.0:\n            para_substituted_protons += 1\n            \n    features['formula_H'] = h_count\n\n    # Analyze 13C NMR for Carbon count and functional groups\n    c_count = 0\n    for shift, (count, _) in c_nmr.items():\n        c_count += count\n        if 190 < shift < 210:\n            features['has_ketone'] = True\n            \n    features['formula_C'] = c_count\n\n    # A p-tolyl group connected to a conjugated ketone system is identified by:\n    # - A ketone group\n    # - Two methyl groups (one on the ring, one from the ketone part)\n    # - A para-substituted ring pattern (two 2H doublets)\n    if features['has_ketone'] and methyl_singlets == 2 and para_substituted_protons == 2:\n        features['has_p_tolyl_skeleton'] = True\n\n    return features\n\ndef check_reactant_candidate(reactant_info, product_features):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a reactant candidate is plausible by comparing its formula and\n    core structure against the features deduced from the product's NMR.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

    "The provided Python script successfully identified the correct starting material, Compound X, by implementing a two-step chemical analysis.\n\nFirst, the script analyzed the `1H-NMR` and `13C-NMR` data of the reaction product. It correctly deduced the product's molecular formula (C11H12O) and identified key structural features: a ketone group (from the `13C` signal at δ 197.7) and a *p-tolyl* (4-methylphenyl) group (from the characteristic `1H` signals of two methyl singlets and a para-substituted aromatic ring).\n\nSecond, the script evaluated each potential reactant (A, B, C, D) against the deduced product features. Since the reaction is an isomerization (the formula C11H12O is conserved), it checked two main criteria:\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** The reactant must have the formula C11H12O. This eliminated option B.\n2.  **Carbon Skeleton:** The reactant must contain a *p-tolyl* group to form the product. This eliminated options C and D, which contain a simple phenyl group.\n\nOnly option A, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, satisfied both conditions, having the correct formula and the necessary p-tolyl skeleton. The tests passed because this logic correctly identified A as the only plausible precursor.\n\n<<<A>>>"
