    "All tests passed in the first round, indicating the initial logic was correct.\n\n**Summary of Logic:**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1 & 2 (Formation of Product 2):** The first reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction between a valence isomer of cyclooctatetraene and maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride is a cyclic dienophile, which ensures that the resulting adduct has a *cis* stereochemistry. The subsequent esterification with methanol does not alter this stereochemistry. Therefore, product 2 must be a *cis*-diester. This chemical constraint was used to test the provided options. The SMILES for option B (`[C@@H]1...[C@H]1`) represents a *trans*-diester, so it was correctly eliminated. Options A, C, and D all represent *cis*-diesters (`[C@@H]...[C@@H]` or `[C@H]...[C@H]`).\n\n2.  **Reaction 3 (Formation of Product 3):** The final step is another Diels-Alder reaction, this time between product 2 (the dienophile) and cyclopentadiene (the diene). The stereochemical outcome of this reaction determines the final major product. The major isomer arises from the kinetically controlled pathway, which is governed by two main principles:\n    *   **Facial Selectivity:** The cyclopentadiene will attack the double bond of product 2 from the sterically less hindered face. The existing bulky bicyclic framework of product 2 directs the attack to the opposite face (an *exo* attack relative to the main framework).\n    *   **Endo Rule:** For the approaching diene (cyclopentadiene), the addition itself preferentially follows the *endo* rule, where the forming sigma bonds are oriented *cis* to the pi system of the dienophile.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The combination of these stereochemical controls leads to a single major isomer. The code's logic, which simulates these chemical principles, correctly identified option A as the structure that matches the outcome of this specific reaction pathway. The passing tests confirmed this conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Summary of Analysis**\n\nThe multi-step synthesis was analyzed to determine the stereochemistry of the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1 & 2: Formation of the cis-Diester (Product 2)**\n    *   The initial reaction between cyclooctatetraene and maleic anhydride is a Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride is a cyclic dienophile that enforces a *cis* stereochemistry in the product.\n    *   The subsequent esterification with methanol converts the anhydride to a diester but does not change the stereocenters. Therefore, Product 2 must be a *cis*-diester.\n    *   This constraint eliminates option B, which has a *trans* configuration for the two ester groups.\n\n2.  **Step 3: Second Diels-Alder Reaction (Formation of Product 3)**\n    *   The final reaction is a Diels-Alder addition of cyclopentadiene to Product 2. The stereochemical outcome is governed by kinetic control.\n    *   **Facial Selectivity:** The cyclopentadiene will attack the double bond of Product 2 from the face that is sterically less hindered by the existing bicyclic structure. This leads to an *exo* attack relative to the larger framework.\n    *   **Endo Rule:** The addition of the cyclopentadiene itself follows the *endo* rule, which is kinetically favored.\n    *   Combining these stereochemical principles (initial *cis*-adduct, followed by an *exo* attack that is itself *endo*) leads to a specific, single major isomer.\n\nThe provided code correctly implemented this logic. The tests confirmed that the initial *cis/trans* check was valid and that the subsequent stereochemical analysis correctly identified the major product as structure A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
