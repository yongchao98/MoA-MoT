The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (`pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])`) is used. At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base (acetate) to the remaining acid is 25:75, or 1:3.\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n    *   The precise calculation gives **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base.\n    *   The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required is 10.00 cm³, making the total volume 50.00 cm³.\n    *   The concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The hydrolysis of acetate produces OH⁻ ions.
