    "This problem describes a Diels-Alder reaction and asks to identify a key cross-peak in a 2D NOESY NMR spectrum that distinguishes the major and minor products. The TDD approach will first model the chemical logic with a deliberate error to show a test failure, then correct the logic to pass the tests.\n\nThe core chemical principle is that the major product of this Diels-Alder reaction is the *endo* adduct, where the anhydride protons are spatially close to the methylene bridge protons. The minor *exo* product has these groups far apart. The NOESY cross-peak in the major product, which is absent in the minor, must therefore connect the signals from these two specific proton groups.\n\n**Round 1: Initial Logic and Tests**\n\nThis block defines the chemical system and writes tests based on the known principles of stereochemistry in Diels-Alder reactions. The initial helper logic `get_diels_alder_product_analysis` is intentionally flawed; it incorrectly assumes the key interaction is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups (Option C) to demonstrate a test failure.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Helper Logic\ndef get_diels_alder_product_analysis(product_type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Diels-Alder product to predict NOESY correlations.\n    This initial version contains a deliberate flaw for TDD demonstration.\n    It incorrectly assumes the correlation is between vinylic methyls and anhydride protons.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In a Diels-Alder reaction, the major product is typically the 'endo' adduct.\n    # The key distinguishing feature in NOESY is the through-space interaction\n    # that is present in the 'endo' but not the 'exo' adduct.\n\n    # Proton signal assignments based on typical chemical shifts from the question:\n    signals = {\n        \"bridge_CH\": \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\",\n        \"vinylic_Me\": \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\",\n        \"anhydride_H\": \"a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"\n    }\n\n    # FLAWED LOGIC: Let's incorrectly assume the interaction is between the vinylic methyls\n    # and the anhydride protons (Option C).\n    if product_type == 'major':\n        # This is the endo product.\n        return (signals[\"vinylic_Me\"], signals[\"anhydride_H\"])\n    else: # minor (exo) product\n        # This specific correlation would be absent.\n        return None\n\n# ASSERT-based tests\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs tests to validate the chemical logic.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_results = collections.OrderedDict()\n\n    # Test Case 1: The major product (endo) should show a correlation between the\n    # anhydride protons and the bridge proton, based on chemical principles.\n    try:\n        # Principle: In the endo adduct, anhydride protons are close to the bridge proton.\n        anhydride_signal = \"a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"\n        bridge_signal = \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\"\n        expected_correlation = {anhydride_signal, bridge_signal}\n\n        major_product_correlation = get_diels_alder_product_analysis('major')\n        \n        # The order of signals in the pair doesn't matter, so we test with sets.\n        assert set(major_product_correlation) == expected_correlation\n        test_results['test_major_product_correlation_logic'] = 'PASSED'\n    except AssertionError:\n        test_results['test_major_product_correlation_logic'] = 'FAILED'\n    except Exception as e:\n        test_results['test_major_product_correlation_logic'] = f'ERROR: {e}'\n\n    # Test Case 2: The function should correctly predict that the distinguishing\n    # correlation is present in the major product but absent in the minor one.\n    try:\n        major_corr = get_diels_alder_product_analysis('major')\n        minor_corr = get_diels_alder_product_analysis('minor')\n        assert major_corr is not None and minor_corr is None\n        test_results['test_presence_in_major_absence_in_minor'] = 'PASSED'\n    except AssertionError:\n        test_results['test_presence_in_major_absence_in_minor'] = 'FAILED'\n    except Exception as e:\n        test_results['test_presence_in_major_absence_in_minor'] = f'ERROR: {e}'\n\n    # Report\n    print(\"--- Test Report ---\")\n    for name, result in test_results.items():\n        print(f\"{name}: {result}\")\n    print(\"-------------------\")\n\n# Execute tests\nrun_tests()\n```\n\n### **Round 2: Corrected Logic**\n\nThe first test failed as expected because the initial logic was incorrect.

This reaction produces two stereoisomers: a major *endo* product and a minor *exo* product.\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry:** In the major (*endo*) product, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the methylene bridge of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. In the minor (*exo*) product, it is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side).\n2.  **NOESY NMR:** This technique detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Ã…). A cross-peak between two signals indicates their corresponding protons are spatially near each other.\n3.  **Analysis:** The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This distinguishing peak must arise from the unique spatial arrangement of the *endo* isomer. The protons on the anhydride ring are close to the protons of the methylene bridge only in the *endo* product.\n4.  **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring, being adjacent to carbonyl groups, correspond to the downfield **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The methylene bridge protons are part of the saturated bicyclic framework and correspond to the upfield signal, represented by the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The cross-peak that appears only in the major product's spectrum connects the resonances for the anhydride protons and the bridge protons. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "### Summary of Analysis\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The problem describes a Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride (the dienophile) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene). This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic product.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry and Products:** The reaction yields two stereoisomers: a major *endo* product and a minor *exo* product. According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* isomer is typically the major product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n\n3.  **Distinguishing Feature (NOESY NMR):** The 2D NOESY NMR technique detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Ã…). A cross-peak between two signals indicates that the corresponding protons are spatially proximate. The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This unique signal must arise from a spatial proximity that exists only in the major (*endo*) isomer.\n\n4.  **Structural Analysis:**\n    *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the bicyclic system, bringing its protons very close to the protons of the methylene (-CH2-) bridge.\n    *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring points away from the methylene bridge, so these sets of protons are far apart.\n\n5.  **NMR Signal Assignment:**\n    *   The two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, assigning them to the downfield signal: **a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The protons on the methylene bridge are part of the saturated bicyclic framework and will appear at a much higher field. The signal described as **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these bridge protons. (The two bridge protons are diastereotopic and would give rise to two distinct signals).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major (*endo*) product must connect the signals for the protons that are only close in that isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the bridge protons. Therefore, the cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
