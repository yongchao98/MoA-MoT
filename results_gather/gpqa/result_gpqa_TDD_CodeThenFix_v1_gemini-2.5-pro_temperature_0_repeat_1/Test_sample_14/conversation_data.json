  "question": "Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:\n\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

The transit probability is proportional to the host star's radius divided by the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`P_transit ∝ R_star / a`).\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis `a` is related to the host star's mass `M_star` and the planet's orbital period `P_orbit` by `a ∝ (M_star * P_orbit²) ^ (1/3)`.\n\nBy substituting this into the probability relation, we find that the transit probability is proportional to `R_star / (M_star * P_orbit²) ^ (1/3)`.\n\nTo find which planet is preferred, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities (`Prob_1 / Prob_2`). Using the relationships given in the problem:\n-   `R_star1 = R_star2` (Ratio = 1)\n-   `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2` (Ratio = 2)\n-   `P_orbit1 = P_orbit2 / 3` (Ratio = 1/3)\n\nThe calculation for the probability ratio is:\n`Ratio = (R_star1 / R_star2) * [ (M_star2 / M_star1) * (P_orbit2 / P_orbit1)² ] ^ (1/3)`\n`Ratio = 1 * [ (1 / 2) * (3 / 1)² ] ^ (1/3)`\n`Ratio = [ 1/2 * 9 ] ^ (1/3)`\n`Ratio = 4.5 ^ (1/3) ≈ 1.651`\n\nThis result means that Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n<<<C>>>",
