The bulky nitro and carboxylate groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond connecting them. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a chiral conformation. Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule has a **chiral center**. The carbon at the 2-position is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: This molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry that bisects the carbonyl group and the two phenyl rings. It does not have a chiral center and is superimposable on its mirror image.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is a *trans*-alkene. It has a plane of symmetry coinciding with the plane of the molecule itself. It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Summary\n\nThe TDD process successfully identified the requirements for optical isomerism. The initial logic only accounted for chirality arising from an asymmetric carbon center, causing the test for the biphenyl compound to fail. The revised logic correctly incorporated atropisomerism, a type of chirality caused by hindered rotation, which allowed all tests to pass.\n\nThe final analysis of the compounds is as follows:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is chiral. The bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a chiral conformation that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule is chiral. It contains a **chiral carbon center** (the carbon at the 2-position), which is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). This asymmetry makes it optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: This molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry that runs through the central carbonyl group, making it superimposable on its mirror image. It does not show optical isomerism.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
