    "All tests passed in the first round, confirming the logic used to solve the problem. The code correctly identified the salts and verified that their decomposition products match the quantities given in the problem statement.\n\n### Summary of Logic\n\n1.  **Identify Products:** The problem describes the decomposition of two salts, producing a mixture of gases.\n    *   Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂) absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 moles of H₂O.\n    *   Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) is for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Its weight did not change, so no such gases were produced.\n    *   Tube №3 (red-hot copper) reacts with oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms forming CuO. This corresponds to 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 moles of O atoms, which means 0.025 moles of O₂ gas.\n    *   The remaining gas C is 2.24 L at STP, which is 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 moles. Since it passed through all tubes, it must be a non-reactive gas like N₂.\n\n2.  **Deduce Reactants:** The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The reactants are salts that decompose completely into gases. This strongly suggests ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. The two most common salts that fit this profile are:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n3.  **Write and Balance Reactions:**\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂:  `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃: `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n\n4.  **Verify with Stoichiometry:** The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\n    *   From n moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles N₂ and `2n` moles H₂O are produced.\n    *   From n moles of NH₄NO₃: `n` moles N₂, `0.5n` moles O₂, and `2n` moles H₂O are produced (dividing the balanced equation by 2 to match `n` moles of reactant).\n    *   **Total moles of products:**\n        *   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n\n        *   O₂: 0.5n\n        *   N₂: n + n = 2n\n    *   Using the experimental data:\n        *   Moles H₂O = 0.2  => 4n = 0.2 => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   Moles O₂ = 0.025 => 0.5n = 0.025 => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   Moles N₂ = 0.1   => 2n = 0.1 => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   The value n = 0.05 is consistent for all products, confirming our hypothesis.\n\n5.  **Calculate Final Answer:** The question asks for the total number of atoms in one molecule of salt A and one molecule of salt B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms:** 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Summary of Solution\n\nThe problem was solved by first identifying the products of the thermal decomposition and their quantities based on the experimental results.\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** The mass increase of 3.60 g in the tube with Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to 0.2 moles of H₂O.\n2.  **Oxygen (O₂):** The mass increase of 0.80 g in the tube with red-hot copper corresponds to 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms, which is 0.025 moles of O₂ gas.\n3.  **Nitrogen (N₂):** The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP corresponds to 0.1 moles of a non-reactive gas, identified as N₂.\n4.  **No Acidic Gases:** The weight of the Ca(OH)₂ tube did not change, indicating no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n\nBased on the products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) and the fact that the reactants were salts, the most likely candidates are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n\nAssuming an equimolar mixture with `n` moles of each salt, the total moles of products would be:\n*   Moles of N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n*   Moles of H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n*   Moles of O₂ = `0.5n` (from B)\n\nUsing the experimental data, we find `n = 0.05` moles, which is consistent across all three products. This confirms the identity of the salts.\n\nThe final question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n*   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n*   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
