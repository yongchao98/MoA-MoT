    "This is a problem of dimensional analysis in quantum field theory. Let's apply the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology to solve it.\n\n### Round 1: Helper Logic and Tests\n\nFirst, I'll define the helper functions to calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and determine the theory's renormalizability.

Here is the summary of the reasoning.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimensions in Natural Units:** In 4-dimensional spacetime and using natural units ($\\hbar=c=1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ must be dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x]_M = -4$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$ to compensate. The mass dimensions of the fields are derived from their kinetic terms:\n    *   Fermion field $\\psi$: $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$\n    *   Gauge field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$: $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$\n    *   The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$ is composed of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is also dimensionless: $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of $\\kappa$:** The mass dimension of the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$ must also be 4. We can find the dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ by ensuring the total dimension of the term adds up correctly:\n    $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n    $[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n    $[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n    $[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n    $[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\n3.  **Renormalizability:** A theory is considered renormalizable by power-counting if the mass dimensions of all its coupling constants are non-negative (i.e., $\\geq 0$). Since $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable. Higher-order corrections would introduce increasingly severe divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms.\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nB",
