  "question": "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA) The compound is contaminated with a precursor\nB) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nC) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

The key observations are:\n1.  **NMR:** Two peaks for a single proton, indicating the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n2.  **LC-MS:** Two separable peaks, both having the same mass, confirming two distinct species with the same molecular formula.\n\nBased on these facts, we can evaluate the options:\n*   **A) Contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect because a precursor would almost certainly have a different mass.\n*   **B) Mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers are mirror images that have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Standard LC and NMR are achiral techniques and cannot distinguish between enantiomers; they would appear as a single peak in both methods.\n*   **C) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the correct explanation. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and are therefore separable by standard techniques like LC. Their different 3D structures result in distinct NMR spectra. In peptides, a common source of diastereomerism is restricted rotation around the amide bond, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers (a type of atropisomerism). These two isomers fit all the observations perfectly.\n*   **D) 'Double coupling':** This would result in a product with a different, higher mass, which contradicts the LC-MS data.\n\nTherefore, the presence of two separable species with the same mass and distinct NMR spectra points unequivocally to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "### Summary\n\nThe provided analytical data points to a single compound existing as a mixture of two distinct, but closely related, species. Let's break down the evidence:\n\n1.  **LC-MS Analysis:** The observation of two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace indicates the presence of two species that are separable by standard chromatographic methods. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected product. This is a crucial piece of information:\n    *   It rules out **A) Contamination with a precursor** and **D) 'Double coupling'**, as both would result in species with a different mass than the target compound.\n    *   It confirms the two species are **isomers** (molecules with the same formula but different structures).\n\n2.  **NMR Analysis:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. This means the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   This rules out **B) A mixture of enantiomers**. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are indistinguishable and would produce a single, identical set of peaks.\n    *   This strongly supports **C) A mixture of diastereoisomers**. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties, are separable by standard LC, and will give distinct NMR spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:** The crude compound exists as a mixture of two species that have the same mass but different physical properties (separable by LC) and different chemical environments (distinct NMR signals). This is the definition of diastereomers. In the context of a synthesized peptide, this is often caused by restricted rotation around an amide bond, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers, which are a form of diastereomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"

LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA) The compound is contaminated with a precursor\nB) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nC) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",
    "Code output: --- TDD Report (Round 1) ---\ntest_main_scenario: PASSED\ntest_precursor_case: FAILED (Expected 'A', but got 'C')\ntest_enantiomer_case: PASSED\n----------------------------\nSummary: 2 passed, 1 failed.\n----------------------------\n\nErrors: \nPlease provide ONE revised python block that fixes the logic so all tests pass, and prints the passing report.",
