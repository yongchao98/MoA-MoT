    "This problem asks for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the classical electromagnetic field generated by a moving point charge. The scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) are evaluated at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$, but they depend on the properties of the charge (position $\\vec{s}$, velocity $\\vec{v}$) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time $t_r$. The retarded time is when the electromagnetic signal, traveling at the speed of light $c$, must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at time $t$.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nBy factoring out $1/c$ from the denominator, we can rewrite them as:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThese expressions match option B.

The implemented logic, which corresponds to the formulas in option B, is self-consistent and adheres to the known physical relationship between the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge ($\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$). This confirms that the formulas are correct. No code revision is necessary.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

The TDD process confirmed that these formulas are physically consistent, as they satisfy the fundamental relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$.\n\n<<<B>>>",
