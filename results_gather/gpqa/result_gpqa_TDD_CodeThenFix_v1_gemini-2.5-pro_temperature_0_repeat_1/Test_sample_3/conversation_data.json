    "This problem requires identifying which of Maxwell's equations would change if magnetic monopoles existed. The TDD process will first implement flawed logic that fails some tests, and then corrected logic that passes all of them.\n\nThe key physical principles are:\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (`∇ ⋅ B = 0`)**: This law states there are no magnetic monopoles. If they existed, this law would change to include a magnetic charge density term, altering the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (`∇ × E = -∂B/∂t`)**: If magnetic monopoles could move, they would constitute a magnetic current. This would add a magnetic current term to Faraday's law, altering the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.\n\nThe tests will check which option correctly identifies both of these changes.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Helper Logic: Defines the concepts associated with each answer option.\ndef get_concepts_from_option(option_letter):\n    \"\"\"Maps an option letter to a set of physics concepts.\"\"\"\n    # Note: \"circulation\" corresponds to curl, and \"flux\" corresponds to divergence.\n    concepts = {\n        'A': {'divergence_B', 'curl_B'},\n        'B': {'curl_B', 'divergence_E'},\n        'C': {'divergence_B'},\n        'D': {'curl_E', 'divergence_B'}\n    }\n    return concepts.get(option_letter, set())\n\n# Flawed Logic for Round 1: This logic is incomplete and will fail some tests.\n# It incorrectly assumes that any answer mentioning the divergence of B is sufficient.\ndef check_maxwell_question(option_letter):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given option correctly identifies a changed Maxwell's equation.\n    This initial version is flawed because it doesn't check for completeness, as the\n    question asks for \"equations\" (plural).\n    \"\"\"\n    selected_concepts = get_concepts_from_option(option_letter)\n    # Flaw: This will incorrectly return True for options A and C.\n    return 'divergence_B' in selected_concepts\n\n# ASSERT-based Tests\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"Runs all tests and reports the results.\"\"\"\n    # The correct answer is D, as it is the most complete.\n    # The tests are written with the expectation of a perfect `check_maxwell_question` function.\n    tests = {\n        \"Test A should be False\": not check_maxwell_question('A'),\n        \"Test B should be False\": not check_maxwell_question('B'),\n        \"Test C should be False (incomplete answer)\": not check_maxwell_question('C'),\n        \"Test D should be True (complete answer)\": check_maxwell_question('D'),\n    }\n    \n    passed_count = 0\n    failed_count = 0\n    \n    print(\"--- Running TDD Round 1 Tests ---\")\n    for name, result in tests.items():\n        try:\n            assert result\n            print(f\"PASS: {name}\")\n            passed_count += 1\n        except AssertionError:\n            print(f\"FAIL: {name}\")\n            failed_count += 1\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Test Report ---\")\n    print(f\"Passed: {passed_count}, Failed: {failed_count}\")\n    print(\"---------------------\")\n    \n    # Exit with a non-zero code if any tests failed, to signal the TDD platform.\n    if failed_count > 0:\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_tests()\n```",
    "The initial logic failed because it only checked for the presence of one correct concept (`divergence_B`) instead of verifying that the chosen option contained *all* the correct concepts and no incorrect ones. The existence of magnetic monopoles (magnetic charge) would change Gauss's Law for Magnetism (`∇ ⋅ B = 0` becomes `∇ ⋅ B = ρ_m`), altering the **divergence of the magnetic field**. Furthermore, the movement of these monopoles would create a magnetic current, which would add a new term to Faraday's Law of Induction (`∇ × E = -∂B/∂t` becomes `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m`), altering the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.

If monopoles existed, this law would change to `∇ ⋅ B = ρ_m` (where `ρ_m` is the magnetic charge density), analogous to Gauss's law for electricity. This affects the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction**: In our universe, this law is `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t`, stating that a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. If magnetic monopoles could move, they would constitute a magnetic current (`J_m`). This magnetic current would also create a circulating electric field, adding a term to the equation: `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m`. This affects the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the ones related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The TDD process successfully identified the correct answer by first implementing flawed logic and then refining it.\n\n*   **Round 1:** The initial code incorrectly assumed that any option mentioning the change to the divergence of the magnetic field was sufficient. This led to failed tests because it didn't account for the fact that *two* equations would change, making options A and C incorrect (A for including a wrong concept, C for being incomplete).\n*   **Round 2:** The logic was corrected to check for the *exact* set of required changes. The existence of magnetic monopoles would alter Gauss's Law for Magnetism (affecting the **divergence of the magnetic field**) and Faraday's Law of Induction (affecting the **circulation of the electric field** due to magnetic currents). The revised code correctly identified that only option D contains both of these necessary changes, and all tests passed.\n\nThe final answer is based on these two physical principles. The presence of magnetic monopoles (magnetic charges) would change Gauss's law for magnetism (`∇ ⋅ B = 0` would become `∇ ⋅ B = ρ_m`). The movement of these monopoles would constitute a magnetic current, which would add a new source term to Faraday's law of induction (`∇ × E = -∂B/∂t` would become `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m`). Therefore, the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<D>>>"
