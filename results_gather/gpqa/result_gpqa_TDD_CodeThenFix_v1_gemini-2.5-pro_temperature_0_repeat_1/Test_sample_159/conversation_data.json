    "Here is the first round of the TDD process. I will define the helper logic based on the physics of diffraction from a circular aperture (the limit of an N-sided polygon as N -> infinity) and then write tests to check this logic against the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Round 1: Helper Logic and Tests\n\ndef calculate_angular_distance_coefficient():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficient for the angular distance between the first two minima\n    for Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture.\n\n    The problem states that an N-sided polygon with constant apothem 'a' approaches\n    a circle of radius 'a' as N -> infinity.\n\n    The angular positions (theta) of the minima for a circular aperture are given by:\n    a * sin(theta) = (z_m / (2*pi)) * lambda\n    where 'a' is the radius, 'lambda' is the wavelength, and z_m are the zeros\n    of the first-order Bessel function J1(z).\n\n    For small angles, sin(theta) ≈ theta, so:\n    theta_m = (z_m / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n\n    The first two zeros of J1(z) are:\n    z1 ≈ 3.8317\n    z2 ≈ 7.0156\n\n    The angular distance between the first two minima is theta_2 - theta_1.\n    The coefficient is (z2 / (2*pi)) - (z1 / (2*pi)).\n    \"\"\"\n    Z1 = 3.8317  # First zero of J1(z)\n    Z2 = 7.0156  # Second zero of J1(z)\n\n    # Coefficient for the first minimum's angle\n    coeff_theta_1 = Z1 / (2 * math.pi)\n    # Coefficient for the second minimum's angle\n    coeff_theta_2 = Z2 / (2 * math.pi)\n\n    # The coefficient for the angular distance between them\n    distance_coeff = coeff_theta_2 - coeff_theta_1\n    return distance_coeff\n\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs ASSERT-based tests against the provided options.\n    \"\"\"\n    calculated_coeff = calculate_angular_distance_coefficient()\n    test_results = []\n    \n    # Options from the question\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 0.506,\n        \"B\": 0.500,\n        \"C\": 1.220,\n        \"D\": 0.610,\n    }\n    \n    print(f\"Calculated Coefficient: {calculated_coeff:.4f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Running Tests:\")\n    \n    for option, value in options.items():\n        try:\n            # We use a small tolerance for floating point comparison\n            assert abs(calculated_coeff - value) < 0.001\n            result = \"PASSED\"\n        except AssertionError:\n            result = \"FAILED\"\n        test_results.append(f\"Test for Option {option} ({value}): {result}\")\n        \n    for report in test_results:\n        print(report)\n\n# Execute the test run\nrun_tests()\n```\n\nThe problem describes Fraunhofer diffraction through an N-sided polygon where N is infinitely large. With a constant apothem `a`, this setup converges to a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima in the resulting Airy diffraction pattern are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, `J1(z)`. The formula for the angular position of the m-th minimum is `θ_m = (z_m / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`, where `z_m` is the m-th zero of `J1(z)`.\n\nThe first two zeros are `z₁ ≈ 3.8317` and `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = [(z₂ / (2 * π)) - (z₁ / (2 * π))] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = [(7.0156 / (2 * π)) - (3.8317 / (2 * π))] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ [1.1166 - 0.6098] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis calculated coefficient `0.5068` is closest to option A, which is `0.506`. The test code implements this logic and verifies it against all provided options. The test for option A passes, confirming it as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The tests from the first round have been executed. The output shows that the implemented logic correctly calculates a coefficient of `0.5067`. This value passes the assertion for option A (`0.506`) and fails for all other options, as expected. Since the logic correctly identifies the right answer, no revision is necessary. The goal of the TDD process is to arrive at correct logic, which has been achieved.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between the first two diffraction minima for light passing through an aperture that is an N-sided polygon with N approaching infinity.\n\n1.  **Physical Model**: As the number of sides `N` of a regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` goes to infinity, the polygon approaches a circle of radius `a`. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n2.  **Diffraction Theory**: The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The angular positions `θ` of the dark fringes (minima) are given by the formula:\n    `a * sin(θ) = (z_m / (2 * π)) * λ`\n    where:\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `z_m` are the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(z)`.\n3.  **Small Angle Approximation**: The problem states we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula becomes:\n    `θ_m = (z_m / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n4.  **Calculating the Angular Distance**: We need the distance between the first two minima, which correspond to the first two zeros of `J₁(z)`.\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n    The angular positions are:\n    *   `θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n    *   `θ₂ = (7.0156 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n    The angular distance `Δθ` is the difference between them:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a) = 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated coefficient is approximately `0.507`. This matches option A. The code in the first round correctly implemented this calculation and the test for option A passed.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Therefore, this problem is equivalent to calculating the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\n2.  **Diffraction from a Circular Aperture**: The far-field diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The angular positions (`θ`) of the dark fringes (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(z)`. The condition for a minimum is:\n    `a * sin(θ) = (z_m / (2 * π)) * λ`\n    where `a` is the aperture radius, `λ` is the wavelength, and `z_m` is the m-th zero of `J₁(z)`.\n\n3.  **Small Angle Approximation**: Using the given approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`, the formula simplifies to:\n    `θ_m = (z_m / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n4.  **Calculation**: To find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of the Bessel function, `z₁` and `z₂`.\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    The angular positions of the first two minima are:\n    *   `θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n    *   `θ₂ = (7.0156 / (2 * π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n    The angular distance `Δθ` is the difference between these two angles:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated coefficient `0.5068` is closest to the value in option A. The TDD process confirmed this by implementing the calculation and successfully passing the test for option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
