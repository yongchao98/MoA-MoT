The energy eigenvalues and their degeneracies for this system are well-defined.\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalue:** The energy `E_n` of the `n`-th level is given by the formula `E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω`, where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, ...). The ground state corresponds to `n=0`, the first excited state to `n=1`, the second to `n=2`, and the third excited state to `n=3`.\n    For the third excited state (`n=3`):\n    `E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω`\n\n2.  **Degeneracy:** The degeneracy `g_n` (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level `n`) is given by the formula `g_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2`.\n    For the third excited state (`n=3`):\n    `g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 10`\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is `(9/2)ħω`, and it has a degeneracy of 10. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The provided Python code correctly models the physics of a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The tests passed on the first attempt, confirming the helper logic for calculating the energy and degeneracy is correct.\n\n### Summary of the Solution\n\n1.  **Energy Calculation:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula `E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω`, where `n` is the principal quantum number. The ground state corresponds to `n=0`, the first excited state to `n=1`, and so on. The question asks for the third excited state, which means we must use `n=3`.\n    *   `E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω`\n\n2.  **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy `g_n` (the number of linearly independent states with the same energy `E_n`) is given by the formula `g_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2`. For the third excited state (`n=3`):\n    *   `g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4 * 5) / 2 = 10`\n\nThe calculated energy is `(9/2)ħω` and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
