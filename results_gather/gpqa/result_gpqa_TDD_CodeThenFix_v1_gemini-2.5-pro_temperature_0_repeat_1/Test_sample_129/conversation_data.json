    "This problem requires us to find the minimum redshift `z` that shifts the Lyman-alpha line, normally in the ultraviolet spectrum, into the optical window observable from the ground. The key is to know the approximate atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n\n**Round 1: Initial Logic and Tests**\n\nThe core logic involves the redshift formula: `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)`. We need to solve for `z`. The main physical constraint is the minimum wavelength that can penetrate Earth's atmosphere to reach a ground-based telescope, which is around 3500 Angstroms.\n\nThe test suite will verify the redshift calculation for the specific parameters of the problem and include some general sanity checks.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# (a) Helper Logic\ndef calculate_min_redshift(emitted_wavelength, observed_min_wavelength):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum redshift (z) required for a given emitted wavelength\n    to be shifted to an observed minimum wavelength.\n    The formula for redshift is z = (lambda_observed / lambda_emitted) - 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if emitted_wavelength <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Emitted wavelength must be positive.\")\n    \n    redshift = (observed_min_wavelength / emitted_wavelength) - 1\n    return redshift\n\n# (b) ASSERT-based tests\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a series of tests on the redshift calculation logic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Test Cases ---\n    # The Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms.\n    # The optical window for ground-based telescopes starts after the atmospheric\n    # UV cutoff, which is roughly 3500 Angstroms.\n    # A redshift of z=1.9 shifts 1216 A to 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 A,\n    # which is a very plausible value for the cutoff.\n    \n    tests = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Main Problem: Lyman-alpha to Optical Window\",\n            \"inputs\": {\"emitted\": 1216, \"observed_min\": 3526.4},\n            \"expected\": 1.9,\n            \"tolerance\": 1e-4\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Sanity Check: No Redshift\",\n            \"inputs\": {\"emitted\": 5000, \"observed_min\": 5000},\n            \"expected\": 0.0,\n            \"tolerance\": 1e-9\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Sanity Check: Redshift of z=1\",\n            \"inputs\": {\"emitted\": 3000, \"observed_min\": 6000},\n            \"expected\": 1.0,\n            \"tolerance\": 1e-9\n        }\n    ]\n\n    passed_count = 0\n    failed_count = 0\n    \n    print(\"--- Running TDD Round 1 ---\")\n    for test in tests:\n        try:\n            # Calculate actual result\n            actual = calculate_min_redshift(\n                test[\"inputs\"][\"emitted\"],\n                test[\"inputs\"][\"observed_min\"]\n            )\n            \n            # Assert the condition\n            assert math.isclose(actual, test[\"expected\"], rel_tol=test[\"tolerance\"]), \\\n                f\"Expected {test['expected']}, but got {actual:.4f}\"\n\n            print(f\"[PASS] {test['name']}\")\n            passed_count += 1\n        except (AssertionError, ValueError) as e:\n            print(f\"[FAIL] {test['name']}: {e}\")\n            failed_count += 1\n            \n    print(\"\\n--- Test Report ---\")\n    print(f\"Passed: {passed_count}\")\n    print(f\"Failed: {failed_count}\")\n    print(\"-------------------\")\n\n# Execute the tests\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_tests()\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum redshift (`z`) required to observe the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a quasar using a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   The rest wavelength of the Lyα line is `λ_emitted ≈ 1216` Angstroms (Å). This is in the far-ultraviolet part of the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify Constraints:**\n    *   \"Optical ground-based telescopes\" can only detect light that passes through Earth's atmosphere.\n    *   The atmosphere is opaque to ultraviolet radiation.

Therefore, the observed wavelength `λ_observed` must be at least 3500 Å.\n\n2.  **Apply the Redshift Formula:**\n    The relationship between the emitted wavelength, the observed wavelength, and redshift `z` is:\n    `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimum Redshift:**\n    To find the minimum redshift, we solve for `z` using the minimum required observed wavelength:\n    `z = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1`\n    `z_min ≈ (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n    `z_min ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n    `z_min ≈ 1.878`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated minimum redshift of approximately 1.88 is closest to the answer choice 1.9.
