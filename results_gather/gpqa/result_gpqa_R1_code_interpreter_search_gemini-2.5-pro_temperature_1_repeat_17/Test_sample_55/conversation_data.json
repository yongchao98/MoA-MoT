    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   Initial State: $|i\\rangle = |n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 3s state).\n    *   Final State: $|f\\rangle = |n, l, m\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ (the 1s state).\n    *   Process: The decay occurs via *two consecutive electric dipole transitions*. This implies a cascade process through an intermediate state:\n        $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{transition 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{transition 2}} |1, 0, 0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules for Electric Dipole Transitions:**\n    For a transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer (but for emission, energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n3.  **Identify the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First Transition:** $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |\\text{intermediate}\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Applying the energy rule: $n' < 3$.\n        *   The quantum number $l$ must always be less than $n$ ($l \\le n-1$). So for the intermediate state, we need $l'=1 \\le n'-1$, which means $n' \\ge 2$.\n        *   Combining $n'<3$ and $n' \\ge 2$, the only possibility for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** $|\\text{intermediate}\\rangle = |2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this is allowed for all possible intermediate states.\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$ (Allowed).\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This is true for all possible $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Conclusion: All three pathways, via $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, or $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$, are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Probability for each Route:**\n    *   The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This corresponds to the branching ratio of that route. The total process involves the atom starting in $|3,0,0\\rangle$ and having three possible channels to decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via a two-step process.\n    *   The probability of a given route is determined by the relative rate of the first transition, i.e., the branching ratio for decaying to a specific intermediate state. This is because the second step, from any of the $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ states, has only one possible outcome: the $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ state. Thus, the branching ratio for the second step is 1.\n    *   The rate of a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   We need to compare the rates for the first transition:\n        *   Rate 1: $\\Gamma_1 \\propto |\\langle 2, 1, 1 | \\vec{r} | 3, 0, 0 \\rangle|^2$\n        *   Rate 2: $\\Gamma_0 \\propto |\\langle 2, 1, 0 | \\vec{r} | 3, 0, 0 \\rangle|^2$\n        *   Rate 3: $\\Gamma_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2, 1, -1 | \\vec{r} | 3, 0, 0 \\rangle|^2$\n\n5.  **Use Symmetry (Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\n    *   The initial state $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   The dipole interaction operator, when considering spontaneous emission (summing over all photon polarizations and directions), is also isotropic (treats all directions equally).\n    *   Therefore, the transitions from a spherically symmetric state to the different magnetic substates of a given $l'$ level (here, $l'=1$) must be equally probable.\n    *   This implies that the rates to the three intermediate states $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$ are identical.\n    *   $\\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma_{-1}$.\n    *   The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $2p$ manifold is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_{-1} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Branching Ratio:**\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) of the atom taking the route through the intermediate state $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$ is:\n        $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   Similarly, the probabilities for the routes via $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ and $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$ are also each $1/3$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The question asks to identify the correct pair of a transition route and its probability.\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is possible, but the probability is $1/3$, not $1/4$. So, A is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is possible, and the calculated probability is indeed $1/3$. So, B is correct.\n    *   C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. Assuming the initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, the route is possible, but the probability is $1/3$, not $2/3$. So, C is incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is possible, but the probability is $1/3$, not $1/4$. So, D is incorrect.\n\nThe only correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
