    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) of the third excited state of a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\n**1. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The potential becomes $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Hamiltonian separates into three independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nFor the 3D isotropic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet the principal quantum number be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n\n**2. Identifying the Energy Levels**\n\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to the smallest possible value of $n$, which is $n=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next value of $n$, which is $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. We need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that sum to $n=3$.\n\nThe possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ for $n=3$ are:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) for the third excited state ($n=3$) is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy $g_3 = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nA general formula for the degeneracy of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThis confirms our result. The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3$ is 10.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy.\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\nC) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy.\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
