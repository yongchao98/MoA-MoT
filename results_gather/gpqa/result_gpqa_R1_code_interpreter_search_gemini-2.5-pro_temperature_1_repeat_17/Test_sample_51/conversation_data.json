    "This problem requires us to calculate the factor by which the ratio of the population of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star's effective temperature changes due to starspots. We are given the temperatures for the unspotted and spotted scenarios and the wavelength of the transition between the two energy levels.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio `R = n2 / n1` (where `n2` and `n1` are the number of atoms in the upper energy level 2 and lower energy level 1, respectively) is given by:\n    `R = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g2` and `g1` are the statistical weights of the levels (which we can assume are constant for this problem).\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (`E2 - E1`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n3.  **Relate Energy Difference to Wavelength:** The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the wavelength `λ` of the photon emitted or absorbed during the transition between the two levels by the formula:\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    where:\n    *   `h` is the Planck constant.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Set up the ratio for the two scenarios:** We need to find the factor by which the ratio `R` changes. Let's define the two scenarios:\n    *   **Unspotted Star:** Temperature `T_unspotted = 6000 K`. The population ratio is `R_unspotted`.\n        `R_unspotted = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted))`\n    *   **Spotted Star:** Effective temperature `T_spotted = 5500 K`. The population ratio is `R_spotted`. The problem states the ratio decreases, which is consistent with the lower temperature.\n        `R_spotted = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This means we need to calculate the ratio `F = R_unspotted / R_spotted`.\n\n    `F = [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) ] / [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)) ]`\n\n    The `(g2 / g1)` term cancels out:\n\n    `F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n\n    `F = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)) ]`\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spotted - 1 / T_unspotted) ]`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Now, we plug in the values. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is not needed for this specific calculation, as the resulting effective temperatures are provided.\n\n    *   `h` = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` = 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` = 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `T_unspotted` = 6000 K\n    *   `T_spotted` = 5500 K\n\n    We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J*s\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nwavelength_A = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10  # Convert wavelength to meters\n\nT_unspotted = 6000  # Temperature of the unspotted star in K\nT_spotted = 5500    # Effective temperature of the spotted star in K\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) for the transition\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength_m\n\n# Calculate the term Delta_E / k\ndelta_E_over_k = delta_E / k\n\n# Calculate the factor F = R_unspotted / R_spotted\n# F = exp[ (Delta_E / k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\nfactor = np.exp(delta_E_over_k * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted))\n\nprint(f\"The factor by which the ratio changes is: {factor}\")\n```\n\nThe code will execute the formula `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spotted - 1 / T_unspotted) ]` with the given values. The result of this calculation is approximately 4.5. This aligns with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes as the star's effective temperature varies due to starspots. We are given the temperatures for the unspotted and spotted star and the wavelength of the transition.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Law:** The population of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio `R` of the number of atoms in an upper energy state (`n2`) to a lower energy state (`n1`) is given by:\n\n    `R = n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\n    where:\n    *   `g2` and `g1` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (`E2 - E1`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Unspotted Star:** The temperature `T_unspotted` is 6000 K. The population ratio is `R_unspotted`.\n        `R_unspotted = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted))`\n    *   **Spotted Star:** The effective temperature `T_spotted` is 5500 K. The population ratio is `R_spotted`.\n        `R_spotted = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes *when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots*. This means we need to compute the ratio `F = R_unspotted / R_spotted`.\n\n    `F = [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) ] / [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weight term `(g2 / g1)` is constant for the transition and cancels out:\n\n    `F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`, we get:\n\n    `F = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)) ]`\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spotted - 1 / T_unspotted) ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition wavelength `λ` by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n\n    where:\n    *   `h` is the Planck constant.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Compute:** We can now substitute the expression for `ΔE` into the formula for `F` and use the provided numerical values. The calculation was performed using the Python script.\n\n    *   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `T_unspotted` = 6000 K\n    *   `T_spotted` = 5500 K\n\nThe code executed the following calculation:\n`F = exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1 / 5500 - 1 / 6000) ]`\n\nThe output from the code execution was `4.506409276298925`.\n\nThis value is approximately **4.5**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
