    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. While the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction (using PBr3/Br2) is more common, these reagents can achieve the same outcome. Acetic anhydride can form a mixed anhydride with acetic acid, which enolizes more readily, and pyridine acts as a base to facilitate this process. Bromine then acts as the electrophile to brominate the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) under acidic catalysis to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion, a good leaving group, from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential dialkylation reaction leading to cyclization, similar to the malonic ester synthesis.\n    1.  **First Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (SN2):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the remaining acidic α-proton on the newly formed intermediate is also removed.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular SN2):** The carbanion now attacks the other end of the carbon chain within the same molecule, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. The chain consists of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane derivative, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CN\n      |\n   C1--CO-O-CH2(b)-CH3(a)\n  /  \\\nC2H2 C6H2\n|    |\nC3H2 C5H2\n  \\  /\n   C4H2\n```\nThe molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group (assuming a planar conformation for the ester). This has several consequences for the equivalence of the protons:\n*   The CH2 group at C2 is equivalent to the CH2 group at C6.\n*   The CH2 group at C3 is equivalent to the CH2 group at C5.\n*   The molecule as a whole is achiral.\n\nLet's count the number of chemically distinct sets of protons:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are equivalent because the molecule is achiral. **(1 signal)**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:** We must consider the diastereotopicity of the axial and equatorial protons in the chair conformation.\n    *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C2 are diastereotopic. Due to the plane of symmetry, the axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in two distinct signals for these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** Similar to the C2/C6 position, the axial and equatorial protons here are diastereotopic. Symmetry makes the two axial protons (at C3 and C5) equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons equivalent to each other. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are not interconverted by this symmetry element. The axial proton at C4 has a 1,3-diaxial relationship with the substituents at C1, which is different from the environment of the equatorial proton. Therefore, the axial and equatorial protons at C4 are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n\nThe total number of distinct hydrogen signals is 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n<<<D>>>"
