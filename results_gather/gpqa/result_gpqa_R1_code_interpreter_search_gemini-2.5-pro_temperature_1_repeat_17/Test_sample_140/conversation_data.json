    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction proceeding via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where the hydrogen at position 2 has been replaced by its isotope, deuterium (D). Bromine (Br) is at position 1.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active base is the amide ion, NH2⁻). Liquid ammonia acts as the solvent and a proton source in the final step.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition**\n\nThis reaction proceeds through a two-step elimination-addition mechanism involving a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base, NH2⁻, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe base can abstract a particle from either position, leading to two different elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Abstraction of H from C6):**\n    *   The NH2⁻ base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect).\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6.\n    *   The carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   The result is a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Abstraction of D from C2):**\n    *   Although less likely, it is still possible for the NH2⁻ base to abstract the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C2.\n    *   The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    *   The result is a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed in this step, this intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne (major) and benzyne (minor).\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction is the amide ion (NH2⁻). It will attack one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3), to give the final product.\n\n*   **Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne:**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The D is at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. The NH2 group is at C1, and the D is at C2. Protonation of the C6 carbanion gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. The NH2 group is at C6, and the D is at C2. Protonation of the C1 carbanion gives a product which, when numbered systematically (with the -NH2 group at position 1), is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne:**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n    *   Attack of NH2⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  **Aniline** (from the minor benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from the major 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from the major 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, we must count all products that can be formed, regardless of their yield. Therefore, there are 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
