    "*   **Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide**\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   `trans-cinnamaldehyde` (C6H5-CH=CH-CHO): This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. It has a benzene ring (6 carbons), a C=C double bond (2 carbons), and an aldehyde group (1 carbon), for a total of 9 carbon atoms.\n        *   `methylmagnesium bromide` (CH3MgBr): This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Reaction:** Grignard reagents typically perform a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl carbon of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. The methyl group from CH3MgBr attacks the aldehyde carbon. After an acidic workup, the aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol with an added methyl group (-CH(OH)CH3).\n    *   **Product 1:** The resulting molecule is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol (C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3).\n    *   **Carbon Count for Product 1:** We start with 9 carbons in cinnamaldehyde and add 1 carbon from the methyl group. The total number of carbon atoms in Product 1 is 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n    *   **Reactant:** `Product 1` (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol), which is a secondary alcohol.\n    *   **Reagent:** `Pyridinium chlorochromate` (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent.\n    *   **Reaction:** PCC oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not affect the C=C double bond or the benzene ring. The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) is converted to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n    *   **Product 2:** The resulting molecule is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (C6H5-CH=CH-C(=O)CH3).\n    *   **Carbon Count for Product 2:** This is an oxidation reaction, which involves the removal of hydrogen atoms, not carbon atoms. Therefore, the number of carbon atoms remains the same. Product 2 has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO**\n    *   **Reactant:** `Product 2` ((E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one), which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane` is the IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium ylide, ((CH3)2S(O)CH2), also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n    *   **Reaction:** The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones via a Michael (1,4-conjugate) addition. The methylene group (-CH2-) from the ylide adds across the C=C double bond of the ketone, forming a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   **Product 3:** The reaction converts the C=C double bond into a three-membered ring. The resulting molecule is 2-acetyl-1-phenylcyclopropane.\n    *   **Carbon Count for Product 3:** Product 2 had 10 carbon atoms. The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent adds one carbon atom (from the -CH2- group) to the molecule. Therefore, the total number of carbon atoms in Product 3 is 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nThe final product, 2-acetyl-1-phenylcyclopropane, contains a 6-carbon phenyl ring, a 3-carbon cyclopropane ring, and a 2-carbon acetyl group, for a total of 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
