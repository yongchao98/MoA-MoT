    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the \"Impulse Approximation\"**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex many-body interaction (e.g., a lepton scattering off a nucleus) into a much simpler one. The approximation treats the interaction as a sudden \"impulse\" delivered to a single nucleon, which then behaves as if it were a free particle during the interaction. Let's analyze what conditions are needed for this to be a valid picture.\n\n**2. Analysis of the individual assumptions:**\n\n*   **Assumption 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the foundational principle of the approximation. If the interaction current could simultaneously interact with two or more nucleons (these are called \"meson-exchange currents\" or \"two-body currents\"), then you could not treat the process as an interaction with a single, isolated nucleon. Therefore, this assumption is essential. It reduces the many-body problem to a one-body problem.\n\n*   **Assumption 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This concerns the state of the particles *before* and *after* the primary interaction. If the incoming probe (e.g., an electron) could scatter off other nucleons before hitting the target, or if the struck nucleon could re-scatter on its way out of the nucleus (so-called \"final-state interactions\"), the simple picture of a clean, one-on-one collision would be ruined. The final state would not be that of a free nucleon leaving the scene. Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" to the incoming and outgoing particles is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA). This assumption is therefore necessary for the approximation to hold in its idealized form.\n\n*   **Assumption 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This assumption deals with the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, describing it as a composite object of quarks. However, the impulse approximation is about the behavior of the *nucleon as a whole* within the *nucleus*. It simplifies the nucleon's interaction with its environment, not its own internal physics. In fact, impulse approximations are often used in high-energy scattering experiments where the kinematics are highly relativistic. The internal structure of the nucleon is typically accounted for by using \"form factors,\" which can be calculated from relativistic or non-relativistic quark models, but the choice of model is separate from the impulse approximation itself. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation.\n\n*   **Assumption 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the very heart of the \"impulse\" idea. An impulse is a large force delivered over a very short time. For this approximation to be valid, the interaction time must be much shorter than the characteristic time it takes for a nucleon to orbit within the nucleus. If the interaction is sufficiently fast (which corresponds to high momentum transfer), the nucleon is struck and ejected before it has time to feel the pull of the surrounding nucleons or the overall nuclear binding potential. It effectively acts \"free\" *during* the collision. This assumption is absolutely essential.\n\n**3. Synthesis**\n\nTo treat a nucleon in a nucleus as \"free\" during an interaction (the impulse approximation), you must assume:\n1.  The interaction targets only that single nucleon.\n2.  The binding forces are negligible during the short interaction time.\n3.  The rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere with the probe coming in or the nucleon going out.\n\nThese conditions correspond exactly to assumptions 1, 4, and 2. Assumption 3 is related to a different level of modeling (the internal structure of the nucleon) and is not a prerequisite for the impulse approximation itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
