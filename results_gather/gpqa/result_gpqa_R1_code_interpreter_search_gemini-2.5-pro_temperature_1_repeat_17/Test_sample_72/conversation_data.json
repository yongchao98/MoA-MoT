    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Mass of the first astronaut, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Speed of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Mass of the second astronaut, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Speed of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Both astronauts are moving in the same positive x-direction.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Calculate the relative speed ($v_{rel}$):**\nSince both astronauts are moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula to find their relative speed:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**3. Calculate the total energy (E) of the system:**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**Calculate the energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_1/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Now, calculate $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_2/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Now, calculate $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   Sum the individual energies:\n    $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n**4. Compare the results with the given options:**\n*   Calculated relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Calculated total energy: $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
