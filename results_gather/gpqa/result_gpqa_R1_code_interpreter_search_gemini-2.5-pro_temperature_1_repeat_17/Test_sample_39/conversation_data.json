    "*   **Analyze the context:** The conversation takes place between two chemists in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. This setting is crucial. Synthetic chemists spend a significant amount of their time making new molecules and then purifying them from reaction mixtures.\n\n*   **Deconstruct the phrase:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a common colloquialism used by chemists. It metaphorically describes a situation where two or more substances are difficult to resolve or separate from one another using a particular analytical or preparative technique.\n\n*   **Evaluate the primary separation technique:** The most common technique for both analyzing reaction progress and purifying products in a synthetic organic lab is **chromatography**. This includes Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for quick analysis and Column Chromatography for larger-scale purification.\n\n*   **Connect the phrase to the technique:**\n    *   **Chromatography** separates compounds based on their differential interaction with a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). This interaction is primarily governed by the **polarity** of the compounds.\n    *   On a TLC plate, compounds are spotted at the bottom and the solvent moves up the plate. Less polar compounds travel further up, while more polar compounds stick to the stationary phase and travel less. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel the same distance, and their \"spots\" will appear at the same height, literally looking like they are \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   Similarly, in column chromatography, compounds with similar polarities will move through the column at the same rate and will be collected in the same fractions, making them impossible to separate with that particular solvent system. The resulting peaks on a chromatogram would also be overlapping or \"on top of each other.\"\n\n*   **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **A) Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions exist, they aren't what a chemist typically means by this phrase. They would likely use more specific terms like \"aggregation\" or \"complexation.\"\n    *   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a specific physical property measured by a polarimeter. It's used for characterization, not typically for separation. Two compounds being hard to separate chromatographically is a much more common and frustrating problem than them having a similar optical rotation.\n    *   **D) Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of the visual result of a chromatographic separation (overlapping spots on a TLC plate or overlapping peaks on a chromatogram) than it is of a distillation process. Chromatography is used far more frequently for routine purification in a synthetic lab than distillation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The most direct and common interpretation of \"my compounds are on top of each other\" in a synthetic chemistry context refers to a failed chromatographic separation, which occurs when the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
