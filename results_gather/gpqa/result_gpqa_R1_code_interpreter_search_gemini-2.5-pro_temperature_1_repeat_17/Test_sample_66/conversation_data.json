    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital ($l_1=1, l_2=1$). The initial state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. This is an eigenstate of the total orbital angular momentum operator $L^2 = (\\vec{L}_1 + \\vec{L}_2)^2$ and its z-component $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum is $m = -1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Final State:** A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|\\Psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:** According to the principles of quantum mechanics (Born rule), the probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\Psi_{final}>$ given that it was initially in $|\\Psi_{initial}>$ is the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n    $P = |<\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The key to solving this problem is the relationship between the coupled and uncoupled bases. The total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved. The operator for the total z-component is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   For the initial state, $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$, it is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   For the final state, $|\\Psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$, we can determine its eigenvalue under $L_z$:\n        $L_z |\\Psi_{final}> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|1, -1; 1, -1> = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar)|1, -1; 1, -1> = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar)|1, -1; 1, -1> = -2\\hbar |\\Psi_{final}>$.\n        So, the final state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n\n5.  **Use Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** The initial state is an eigenstate of the Hermitian operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue, $-2\\hbar$. A fundamental theorem in linear algebra and quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    Therefore, the inner product of the initial and final states must be zero:\n    $<\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}> = <1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\n6.  **Final Probability:** The probability is the square of this inner product:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis can also be understood using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ where the magnetic quantum numbers must add up, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$.\nIn our case, the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is a superposition of states where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible combinations for $(m_1, m_2)$ are $(0, -1)$ and $(-1, 0)$.\nThe state we are measuring, $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$, has $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-2 \\neq -1$, this state cannot be a component of the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$. Its coefficient (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) in the expansion is zero, and thus the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\nTo confirm this, we can compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ which gives the amplitude of the state $|m_1, m_2>$ in the expansion of $|l, m>$. We are interested in the coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the transition.\n# This corresponds to the amplitude of the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the expansion of the initial state |l=2, m=-1>.\n# The arguments for CG are (j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m).\n# Here, j1=l1=1, j2=l2=1, j=l=2.\n# The initial state has m=-1. The final state has m1=-1 and m2=-1.\ncg_coefficient = CG(1, -1, 1, -1, 2, -1)\nprobability = cg_coefficient.doit()**2\n\n# The doit() method evaluates the symbolic representation.\nprint(probability)\n```\n0\n\nThe code confirms that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0, and therefore the probability is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of finding two electrons in a specific final state after a measurement, given their initial combined state.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$.\n*   The initial state of the combined system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   This state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis**\n\n*   A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n*   We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Therefore, the final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is represented in the uncoupled basis as $|\\Psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Probability**\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|\\Psi_{final}>$ after the measurement, given it started in $|\\Psi_{initial}>$, is the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n\n$P = |<\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n**4. Using Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-components must add up. The coupled state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ that satisfy the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n*   In our initial state, $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   In our final state, $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Let's check if the condition is met for the final state to be a component of the initial state:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n*   Since the sum of the individual z-components ($m_{total} = -2$) is not equal to the total z-component of the initial state ($m = -1$), the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ cannot be part of the expansion of $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\nThis means their inner product is zero. The amplitude for this transition, given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$, is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n<<<C>>>"
