    "This problem involves determining the energy states of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since the particles are identical and have spin-1/2, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFirst, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy of the n-th level is given by:\n`En = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\nwhere `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n\nThe problem defines a unit of energy `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n`En = n^2 * E`\n\nThe lowest few energy levels are:\n*   `E1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   `E2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are fermions (spin-1/2). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin projection `ms` (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_g)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available energy levels, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level.\n*   The next two particles fill the `n=2` level.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n`E_g = (2 * E1) + (2 * E2)`\n`E_g = 2 * (1E) + 2 * (4E)`\n`E_g = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n**4. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1)**\n\nThe first excited state is the lowest energy configuration above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1 = (2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E3)`\n`E_1 = 2 * (1E) + 1 * (4E) + 1 * (9E)`\n`E_1 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**5. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2)**\n\nThe second excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. We must consider all possible single-particle excitations from the ground state and find the second lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives the first excited state with energy 15E.\n*   **Excitation B:** Promote a particle from a lower level. Let's promote a particle from `n=1` to the lowest unoccupied level `n=3`.\n    *   The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two particles in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: `E_2 = (1 * E1) + (2 * E2) + (1 * E3)`\n    *   `E_2 = 1 * (1E) + 2 * (4E) + 1 * (9E)`\n    *   `E_2 = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n\nLet's check other possibilities to ensure this is the second excited state:\n*   **Excitation C:** Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: two in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy: `2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n*   **Excitation D:** Promote two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: `2*(1E) + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\nComparing the excited state energies: 15E < 18E < 20E < 22E.\nThe lowest energy excitation (first excited state) is 15E.\nThe next lowest energy excitation (second excited state) is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
