    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere, while the sphere itself is removed.\n\n**1. Determine the properties of the image charge**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as the original charge. The properties of this image charge are determined by the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`) must be zero.\n\nThe image charge has a magnitude:\n`q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\nAnd it is located at a distance `b` from the center:\n`b = R^2 / d`\n\n**2. Calculate the potential energy of the system**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe formula for the potential energy of a system of a charge and a conductor is given by:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\nThe distance between the original charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\nSo, the potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n`V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this potential back into the formula for the system's potential energy:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Alternative Method: Work Calculation**\n\nThe potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The force on `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k*q^2*R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe potential energy is `U = ∫_d^∞ F(x) dx`:\n`U = ∫_d^∞ [-k*q^2*R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`U = -k*q^2*R * (1/2) ∫ [1/u^2] du`\n`U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R * [-1/u]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R * [-1/(x^2 - R^2)]_d^∞`\n`U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R * [0 - (-1/(d^2 - R^2))]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nD) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
