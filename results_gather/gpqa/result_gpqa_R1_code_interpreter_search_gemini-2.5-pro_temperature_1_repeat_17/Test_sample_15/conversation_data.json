    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers), but the molecule as a whole must lack any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes planes of symmetry (S_1) and centers of inversion (S_2).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, all carbon atoms are either part of a double bond (sp2 hybridized) or have at least two identical substituents (e.g., -CH3, -CH2-).\n    *   There are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n    *   The molecule is planar about the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using absolute configuration descriptors (R, S) and geometric isomerism descriptor (E).\n    *   A name like (3aR, 7aS)... refers to a specific enantiomer. A single enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active. Its mirror image would be the (3aS, 7aR)... compound, which would be a non-superimposable molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   When a molecule has multiple stereocenters, we must check for internal symmetry. The (2R, 3S) configuration creates a molecule with a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry in certain conformations.\n    *   Let's draw a Fischer projection for the (2R,3S) isomer:\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n        CH3 -- C -- H   (2R)\n               |\n          H -- C -- CH3   (3S)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   A horizontal line drawn between C2 and C3 represents a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   This is a **meso compound**, which is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above.\n    *   Let's draw the Fischer projection for the (2R,3R) isomer:\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n        CH3 -- C -- H   (2R)\n               |\n        CH3 -- C -- H   (3R)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, (R), indicating the molecule is chiral.\n    *   Let's verify this. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=CH-`, and (4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. Because the path around the ring from C1 in each direction is different due to the position of the double bond, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is the isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒ_v). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral** and thus **optically inactive**. Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereogenic carbons, the overall molecule is achiral (meso-like).\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers.\n        *   The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it's not chiral.\n        *   All other carbons in the butanoyl chain are either sp2 hybridized (`C=O`) or part of a `CH2` group, so they are not chiral.\n        *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are `CH2` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl. This carbon is attached to -H, the carbonyl group, and two `-CH2-` groups within the ring. The path around the ring in both directions is identical (`-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-`). Thus, this carbon is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
