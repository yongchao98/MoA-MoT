    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and charge induction:**\n    *   We start with a spherical conductor that is electrically neutral (uncharged).\n    *   A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed inside the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero.\n    *   To achieve this, the charge `+q` inside the cavity induces charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface drawn entirely within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity. Since the electric field `E` is zero everywhere on this surface, the net electric flux through it is zero. According to Gauss's Law ($\\Phi_E = Q_{enclosed} / \\epsilon_o$), the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity, `q_inner`. Therefore, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which implies `q_inner = -q`. A charge of `-q` is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge conservation and the outer surface:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. We now have a charge of `-q` on its inner surface.\n    *   To conserve the total charge of the conductor (which must remain zero), a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. So, `q_outer = +q`.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the electric field in the region outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor. In this problem, there are no other external charges.\n    *   The arrangement of charges inside the cavity (the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall) does not produce any electric field outside the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is produced entirely by the `+q` charge that resides on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge distribution on the outer surface:**\n    *   The charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that makes the conductor an equipotential surface.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges to influence it, the charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over the surface. The non-symmetrical position of the cavity inside has no effect on the outer charge distribution due to the shielding effect of the conducting material.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   We need to find the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor (O).\n    *   According to the shell theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius `R`. The center of this sphere is O.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field `E` at point P (at distance `L > R` from O) is the same as that of a point charge `+q` placed at O.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at distance `L` from a charge `q` is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion on extraneous information:**\n    *   The problem provides several other parameters: the radius of the cavity `r`, the distance of the cavity's center from the conductor's center `s`, the distance of point P from the cavity's center `l`, and the angle `\\theta`.\n    *   Based on the principle of electrostatic shielding, all of this information about the internal geometry is irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. It is included to test the conceptual understanding of the physics.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
