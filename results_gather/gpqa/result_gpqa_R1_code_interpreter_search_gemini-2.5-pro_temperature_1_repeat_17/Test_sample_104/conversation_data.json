    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Scenario**\n\n*   We have a star that is rotating.\n*   One hemisphere of the star is \"clean\" (unspotted) and has a uniform temperature `T_eff`.\n*   The other hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The spots cover a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of this hemisphere's surface and have a lower temperature `T_spot`. The rest of that hemisphere (`1-f`) is at `T_eff`.\n*   As the star rotates, an observer sees either the clean hemisphere or the spotted hemisphere. This causes a periodic change in the star's total brightness (flux).\n\n**2. Quantify the Brightness Variation (Flux Modulation)**\n\nWe need to calculate the maximum and minimum flux received from the star. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy radiated per unit area (flux) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T^4`). The total brightness is this flux integrated over the star's visible disk.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the clean, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff^4`, where `A_disk` is the projected area of the star's disk (`π * R_star^2`).\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The visible disk is now a mix of hot photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   The fraction of the disk at `T_eff` is `(1 - f)`.\n    *   The fraction of the disk at `T_spot` is `f`.\n    `F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4] + [f * A_disk * T_spot^4]`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The problem asks for the amplitude of the signal, which in this context is the relative drop in brightness from the maximum. This is analogous to a transit depth.\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nLet's derive the formula for the amplitude:\n`Amplitude = (A_disk * T_eff^4 - {[(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4] + [f * A_disk * T_spot^4]}) / (A_disk * T_eff^4)`\n\nWe can cancel `A_disk` from all terms:\n`Amplitude = (T_eff^4 - (1 - f) * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n`Amplitude = (T_eff^4 - T_eff^4 + f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n`Amplitude = (f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n**3. Relate the Spot Signal to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nThe problem asks what size exoplanet would produce the same amplitude signal if it were transiting an *unspotted* star.\n\n*   **Exoplanet Transit Depth:** When a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The depth of this transit is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    `Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n*   **Equating the Signals:** We set the amplitude of the spot modulation equal to the transit depth.\n    `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n*   Effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\nWe need to solve for `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) ]`\n\nLet's use a short Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Spot temperature in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the flux variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - math.pow(T_spot / T_eff, 4))\n\n# The amplitude is equal to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(Amplitude)\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(Rpl_over_Rstar)\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n0.3217910901199321\n```\n\nThe calculated value for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.3218.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe value `~0.32` is the closest match.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A darker, spotted hemisphere rotating into view.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of the star.\n\nWe need to find the size of a planet (`R_pl`) that would cause the same brightness dip as the spotted hemisphere. The final answer should be the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (`R_pl / R_star`).\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Drop from the Starspots**\n\nThe brightness (or flux, `F`) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`T^4`), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the clean, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star is at the effective temperature, `T_eff`.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff^4`\n    (where `A_disk` is the area of the star's visible disk)\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. On this face, a fraction `f` (the filling factor) is covered by cooler spots (`T_spot`), and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` is at the normal temperature (`T_eff`).\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff^4 + f * A_disk * T_spot^4`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude of the variation is the relative drop in flux, similar to a transit depth.\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nLet's substitute the formulas for flux. The `A_disk` term will cancel out:\n`Amplitude = (T_eff^4 - [(1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4]) / T_eff^4`\n`Amplitude = (T_eff^4 - T_eff^4 + f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n`Amplitude = (f * T_eff^4 - f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4`\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n**3. Relate the Spot Amplitude to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its area to the star's area.\n\n*   **Transit Depth:** `Depth = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\nThe problem states that the signal amplitude from the spots is the same as the transit depth. Therefore:\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow, we can solve for `R_pl / R_star` by taking the square root and plugging in the given values:\n*   Filling factor, `f = 20% = 0.20`\n*   Effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4) ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value matches the result from the code execution. Comparing our result to the options:\n\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.3218` is closest to **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
