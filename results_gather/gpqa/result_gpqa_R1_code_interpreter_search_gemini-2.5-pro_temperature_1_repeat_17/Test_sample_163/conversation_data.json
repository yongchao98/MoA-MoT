    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). That is, we need to compute M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The total mass of a binary star system is related to its orbital properties. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass (M = m1 + m2) can be determined. A key formula relates the total mass to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mass Equation:** The formula for the total mass of a binary system is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a system with inclination `i` (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane), the total mass is given by:\n    M = (P / (2 * π * G * (sin i)³)) * (K1 + K2)³\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Use Key Information:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. An eclipse can only occur if we are viewing the system nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore (sin i)³ ≈ 1. This greatly simplifies the mass equation:\n    M ≈ (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2. Let's write the mass equation for each system:\n    *   For system_1: M1 = (P1 / (2 * π * G)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³\n    *   For system_2: M2 = (P2 / (2 * π * G)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³\n\n    When we take the ratio M1 / M2, the constant term (1 / (2 * π * G)) cancels out:\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³]\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2)]³\n\n6.  **Extract Values from the Problem:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period, P1 = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitudes, K1_1 = 10 km/s, K1_2 = 5 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes: K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period, P2 = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitudes, K2_1 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes: K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Now, substitute these values into the ratio formula. We can keep the units as they are (years for period, km/s for velocity) because we are calculating a dimensionless ratio.\n\n    M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n8.  **Convert to Decimal and Compare with Options:**\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.7\n    B) ~ 0.6\n    C) ~ 0.4\n    D) ~ 1.2\n\n    The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a simple Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0  # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0   # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_1 = 15.0  # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# The total mass M is proportional to P * (K1 + K2)^3.\n# We want to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocities for each system\nK_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\nK_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n> executing code...\n> 0.432\n>\n> <<<C>>>",
