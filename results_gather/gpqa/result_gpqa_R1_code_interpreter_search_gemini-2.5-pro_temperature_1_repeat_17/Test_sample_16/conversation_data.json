    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the dissociation equilibrium reaction:**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex ($[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$).\n    The reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the dissociation constant ($K_d$) to the given formation constant ($K_f$):**\n    The problem gives the formation constant, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$ (or $K_f$), which is for the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:**\n    Because $K_d$ is very small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M).

    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. The dissociation reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.
