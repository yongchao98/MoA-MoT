    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the surface defined by the given metric.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Metric and Area Element\n\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a 2-dimensional metric in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The metric is of the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dx\\,dy + g_{yy}dy^2$.\nBy comparing the given metric with the general form, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nSo, the metric tensor is:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ in these coordinates is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)}\\,dx\\,dy$.\nLet's compute the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the area element:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2}\\,dx\\,dy = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right|\\,dx\\,dy$\n\n### 2. Defining the Domain of Integration\n\nThe metric is physically meaningful only when the components of the metric tensor are positive definite. This requires the term in the denominator to be positive:\n$4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0$\n$x^2 + y^2 < 4$\n\nThis inequality defines the domain of our surface: it is an open disk $D$ of radius 2 centered at the origin in the $(x, y)$ plane. The phrase \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" refers to this entire domain endowed with the given metric.\nInside this disk, the denominator $4-x^2-y^2$ is always positive, so we can drop the absolute value bars from the area element:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\,dx\\,dy$\n\n### 3. Setting up the Area Integral\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the entire domain $D$:\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\,dx\\,dy$\n\nTo evaluate this integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\n\nIn polar coordinates, $x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$, and the area differential becomes $dx\\,dy = \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$. The domain of integration $D$ is described by:\n$0 \\le \\rho < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral, we get:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Integral\n\nWe can separate the integral into two parts:\n$A = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}\\,d\\rho\\right)$\n\nThe integral with respect to $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi$\n\nThe integral with respect to $\\rho$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ becomes infinite as $\\rho$ approaches 2. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n$I_\\rho = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}\\,d\\rho = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}\\,d\\rho$\n\nLet's use the substitution $u = 4 - \\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho\\,d\\rho$, so $\\rho\\,d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\nThe limits of integration change as follows:\nWhen $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\nWhen $\\rho = R$, $u = 4 - R^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -16 \\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{1}{u}\\,du = -16 [\\ln|u|]_{4}^{4-R^2}$\n$= -16 (\\ln|4-R^2| - \\ln|4|) = 16 (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4-R^2)) = 16 \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{4-R^2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we take the limit as $R \\to 2^-$:\n$I_\\rho = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} 16 \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{4-R^2}\\right)$\n\nAs $R$ approaches 2 from below, the denominator $4-R^2$ approaches $0$ from the positive side ($0^+$). Therefore, the fraction $\\frac{4}{4-R^2}$ approaches $+\\infty$. The natural logarithm of a number approaching $+\\infty$ also approaches $+\\infty$.\nSo, $I_\\rho = 16 \\cdot (+\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n\nThe integral with respect to $\\rho$ diverges to infinity.\n\nThe total area is:\n$A = 2\\pi \\cdot I_\\rho = 2\\pi \\cdot (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe area of the surface described by the given metric is infinite.\nLet's review the options:\nA) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$: An area must be a scalar value, not a function of coordinates. Incorrect.\nB) 0: The area element is strictly positive over the domain, so the total area cannot be zero. Incorrect.\nC) $+\\infty$: This matches our calculation. Correct.\nD) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$: An area must be a scalar value, not a function of coordinates. Incorrect.\n\nThe final answer is that the area is infinite.\n\n<<<C>>>"
