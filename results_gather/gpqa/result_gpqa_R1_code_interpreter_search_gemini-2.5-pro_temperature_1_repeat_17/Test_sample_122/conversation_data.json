    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be S.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta's reference frame be S'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame from the Galaxy's perspective) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest in its own frame (S').\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`. Using this value is standard for such physics problems unless specified otherwise, and it simplifies the `v/c` ratio.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   We don't know `Δt` directly. We must first calculate it from the proper time `Δt'` using the time dilation formula from special relativity.\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the ratio β = v/c.**\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor, γ.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, Δt.**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step D: Calculate the distance, d.**\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   To get a precise value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is `3061862.178478446`, which corresponds to approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nOur calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option D. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial reference frames. Let's call the Galaxy's frame `S` and the ejecta's frame `S'`.\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time measured in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured by a clock at rest in its own frame (`S'`), this is the \"proper time\".\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame (`S`).\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in one reference frame (`S`) will measure a moving clock (in frame `S'`) to be ticking slower than a clock at rest in their own frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The relationship between the time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt` in frame `S`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt'` in frame `S'`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the relative velocity `v`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, let's find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, we can calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity in that frame (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame (`Δt`).\n        `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `v` and `Δt`:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To get a precise numerical answer, we can compute the value.\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,849 km`\n    *   The code execution provided a more precise value: `3,061,862.18 km`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer)\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    Our calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
