    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the products and their quantities.**\n\n*   The mixture of salts A and B is heated, and only gases are formed. These gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. The mass of this tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The increase in the mass of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen atoms that have reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since the gas is molecular oxygen (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** After removing H₂O and O₂, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n*   **Identify gas C:** We can use the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of gas C = Total mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n    *   Mass of gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now, we can find the molar mass of gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂). So, gas C is N₂.\n\n**2. Determine the chemical formulas of salts A and B.**\n\n*   The products of the decomposition are N₂, O₂, and H₂O. This means the original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   Since they are salts and decompose completely into gases, they are likely ammonium salts of oxygen-containing anions. The most common and plausible candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n*   Let's test this hypothesis. Let salt A be NH₄NO₃ and salt B be NH₄NO₂.\n*   The decomposition reactions are:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (This is a high-temperature decomposition, which fits the products)\n*   The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's say there were `x` moles of salt A and `x` moles of salt B.\n*   Let's calculate the total moles of each product based on `x` moles of each salt:\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂(B): `x` mol of N₂ and `2x` mol of H₂O.\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃(A): `x` mol of N₂ (from 2N₂/2NH₄NO₃), `0.5x` mol of O₂ (from O₂/2NH₄NO₃), and `2x` mol of H₂O (from 4H₂O/2NH₄NO₃).\n*   Total moles of products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `x` (from B) + `x` (from A) = `2x`\n    *   Total O₂ = `0.5x` (from A)\n    *   Total H₂O = `2x` (from B) + `2x` (from A) = `4x`\n*   Now, we equate these with the experimental values we found:\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.1 mol  => `2x = 0.1` => `x = 0.05`\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol => `0.5x = 0.025` => `x = 0.05`\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.2 mol  => `4x = 0.2` => `x = 0.05`\n*   All three calculations give a consistent value of `x = 0.05` mol. This strongly supports our hypothesis.\n\n**3. Verify the total mass.**\n\n*   The mixture contains 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the initial mass given in the problem. Our identification of the salts is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17."
