    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. State the principles:**\nThe decay process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** π⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n*   The initial particle, the pion (π⁺), is stationary.\n\n**2. Known Values:**\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of the muon neutrino (m_ν) is approximately 0 MeV/c².\n*   Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is 0, and its initial kinetic energy is 0.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (νμ) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   p_initial = 0\n*   p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0\n*   Therefore, |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**4. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay.\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion: E_initial = m_π * c²\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n*   So, m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**5. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ*c²\n*   For the neutrino (νμ), since m_ν ≈ 0: E_ν = p_ν*c = p*c. Because its rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy: KE_ν = E_ν.\n\n**6. Solving for the Energies:**\nFrom the conservation of energy, we can write:\nm_π*c² = E_μ + E_ν\nSubstitute E_ν = p*c:\nm_π*c² = E_μ + p*c  =>  p*c = m_π*c² - E_μ\n\nNow use the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\nE_μ² = (p_μ*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\nSince p_μ = p, we have:\nE_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nSubstitute the expression for p*c into this equation:\nE_μ² = (m_π*c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ*c²)²\nE_μ² = (m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nCancel E_μ² from both sides:\n0 = (m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)E_μ + (m_μ*c²)²\n\nRearrange to solve for the total energy of the muon (E_μ):\n2(m_π*c²)E_μ = (m_π*c²)² + (m_μ*c²)²\nE_μ = [ (m_π*c²)² + (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2(m_π*c²) ]\n\nNow we can calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ):\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c²\nKE_μ = { [ (m_π*c²)² + (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2(m_π*c²) ] } - m_μ*c²\nCombining the terms gives a simpler formula:\nKE_μ = [ (m_π - m_μ)² * c² ] / [ 2 * m_π ]\n\n**7. Calculation:**\nLet's use the derived formula to calculate the kinetic energies.\n\n```python\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n# Neutrino mass is assumed to be 0\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (mu+)\n# Formula: KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)^2 / (2 * m_pi)\nke_mu = (m_pi - m_mu)**2 / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Calculate the Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\n# Q = Initial Mass Energy - Final Mass Energy\nq_value = m_pi - m_mu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu)\n# By conservation of energy, Q = KE_mu + KE_nu\nke_nu = q_value - ke_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n\nThe output of the code is:\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nRounding the results to two decimal places, we get:\n*   Kinetic Energy of μ⁺ = 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of νμ = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
