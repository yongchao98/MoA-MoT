    "To solve this problem, we need to use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space must be equal to 1.\n\n1.  **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|Ψ(x)|²`. This is calculated as `Ψ*(x)Ψ(x)`, where `Ψ*(x)` is the complex conjugate of the wave function `Ψ(x)`.\n\n    *   Given wave function: `Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i`\n    *   The complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part: `Ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i`\n\n    Now, let's calculate the product `Ψ*(x)Ψ(x)`:\n    `|Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]`\n    This is in the form `(A + B)(A - B) = A² - B²`.\n    `|Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²`\n    `|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)`\n    Since `i² = -1`:\n    `|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)`\n    `|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n2.  **Normalization Integral:** The total probability is the integral of the probability density over the entire space where the particle can be found. The problem states that particles were only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density from 1 to 3, and this integral must equal 1.\n\n    `∫[from 1 to 3] |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1`\n    `∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1`\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Integral:** We can split the integral into two parts:\n    `∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1`\n\n    *   **First part:**\n        `a² ∫[from 1 to 3] ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx = a² [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3`\n        `= a² * ( ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) )`\n        `= a² * ( ln(4) - ln(2) )`\n        Using the logarithm property `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`:\n        `= a² * ln(4 / 2) = a² * ln(2)`\n\n    *   **Second part:**\n        `∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [ 0.25x ] from 1 to 3`\n        `= 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1`\n        `= 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5`\n\n4.  **Solve for 'a':** Now, substitute the results back into the normalization equation:\n    `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n    `a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5`\n    `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    `a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, let's use a more precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# From the normalization condition, we derived the equation for 'a':\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n# Calculate the value of a\na_value = np.sqrt(0.5 / np.log(2))\n\nprint(a_value)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8493263563412753\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value for `a` is approximately 0.8493.

    "The problem requires us to find the value of the constant \"a\" by normalizing the given wave function over the specified interval.\n\n**1. Understand the Wave Function and Probability Density**\n\nThe wave function for each particle is given as:\nΨ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n\nThe probability density, which represents the likelihood of finding the particle at a position x, is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\nTo calculate this, we multiply the wave function by its complex conjugate, Ψ*(x).\n\nThe complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nΨ*(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5i\n\nNow, we calculate the probability density, |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x)Ψ(x):\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\n\nThis is in the form (A + B)(A - B), which simplifies to A² - B².\n|Ψ(x)|² = ( a / √(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\nSince i² = -1:\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nThe normalization condition in quantum mechanics states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1. The problem states that the particles are only found between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 must equal 1.\n\n∫[from 1 to 3] |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n**3. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n*   **Part 1:** a² ∫[from 1 to 3] ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx\n    The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(|1+x|).\n    a² [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3\n    = a² * ( ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) )\n    = a² * ( ln(4) - ln(2) )\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    = a² * ln(4/2)\n    = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Part 2:** ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx\n    = [ 0.25x ] from 1 to 3\n    = (0.25 * 3) - (0.25 * 1)\n    = 0.75 - 0.25\n    = 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, substitute the results back into the normalization equation:\n(a² * ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = √( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nTo find the numerical value of \"a\", we can use the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693.\na = √( 0.5 / 0.693 )\na ≈ √0.7215\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThe calculated value of `a` is approximately 0.849. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0.35\nB) 1.1\nC) 0.6\nD) 0.85\n\nThe value 0.849 is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
