    "This problem requires calculating the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the organic compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The calculation involves using the given bond energies and enthalpy of atomization of carbon.\n\nThe overall formula for the enthalpy of formation based on bond energies is:\nΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of constituent elements in their standard state] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\nLet's break this down into a systematic, step-by-step process.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of each type of atom and bond. The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH3                                         CH3\n      |                                           |\n      C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C\n      |              |                    |\n      CH3            CH3                  CH3\n```\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** There are 12 carbon atoms. (2 in (CH3)2, 1 in C=, 1 in =CH, 1 in -CH2-, 2 in -CH(CH3)-, 1 in -CH2-, 1 in -CH=, 2 in =C(CH3)2). Wait, that's not right. Let's count from the structure parts: `(CH3)2C` (3 C), `=CH` (1 C), `-CH2-` (1 C), `-CH(CH3)-` (2 C), `-CH2-` (1 C), `-CH=` (1 C), `=C(CH3)2` (3 C). Total = 3+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** (3x2) + 1 + 2 + (1+3) + 2 + 1 + (3x2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure: `(CH3)2C=CH` and `CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can find the number of C-C bonds using the total valency of carbon. Each of the 12 carbon atoms must have 4 bonds. The total bonds involving carbon is 12 * 4 = 48. This must equal the sum of bonds connected to carbon: (2 * No. of C=C) + (2 * No. of C-C) + (1 * No. of C-H).\n    48 = (2 * 2) + (2 * No. of C-C) + 22\n    48 = 4 + 2 * No. of C-C + 22\n    48 = 26 + 2 * No. of C-C\n    22 = 2 * No. of C-C\n    No. of C-C bonds = 11.\n    Wait, this is an incorrect method. Let's recount manually from the structure.\n    Let's name the carbons C1 to C12.\n    `(Me)2-C2=C3-C4-C5(Me)-C6-C7=C8-(Me)2`\n    Single bonds in the chain: C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7. (4 bonds)\n    Single bonds to methyl groups: C2 is bonded to 2 methyls, C5 to 1, C8 to 2. (2+1+2 = 5 bonds)\n    Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 bonds**.\n\nLet's re-verify the valency check. Sum of bond orders = (1 * C-H) + (1 * C-C) + (2 * C=C) = 22 + 9 + 2*2 = 35. Total valency = 12*C + 22*H = 12*4 + 22*1 = 70. Sum of bond orders should be half of total valency, 35 = 70/2. This is correct.\n\n**Summary of bond counts:**\n*   No. of C-H bonds = 22\n*   No. of C-C bonds = 9\n*   No. of C=C bonds = 2\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔHat(compound))\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies.\n\nΔHat(compound) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\nΔHat(compound) = (22 × 400 kJ/mol) + (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol)\nΔHat(compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600\n**ΔHat(compound) = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΣΔHat(elements))\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nΣΔHat(elements) = (12 × ΔHat(C)) + (22 × ΔHat(H))\n*   ΔHat(C) is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n*   ΔHat(H) is the energy to form 1 mole of H atoms from H2 gas. Since the bond energy of H-H is for the reaction H2 → 2H, the enthalpy of atomization for one mole of H is half the bond energy.\n    ΔHat(H) = 0.5 × BE(H-H) = 0.5 × 100 kJ/mol = 50 kJ/mol.\n\nΣΔHat(elements) = (12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol) + (22 mol × 50 kJ/mol)\nΣΔHat(elements) = 12000 + 1100\n**ΣΔHat(elements) = 13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form the gaseous atoms from elements and the energy released when those atoms form the compound.\n\nΔHf = ΣΔHat(elements) - ΔHat(compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n**ΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 5: Convert the Answer to the Required Units\n\nThe options provided are in kJ/mol or kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. This does not match option A or D directly. Let's check the options in kJ/g by converting our result.\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12.011 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.3 g/mol.\nUsing approximate masses (C=12, H=1): M = 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert ΔHf from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol\nΔHf (kJ/g) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\nLet's double-check the other options:\n*   A) 67.4 kJ/mol - Incorrect.\n*   B) 1900 kJ/g - This would imply a molar mass of 1 g/mol, which is incorrect.\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol - This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n```python\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\n# Bond counts: C-H=22, C-C=9, C=C=2\n# Given data (kJ/mol): H_at(C)=1000, BE(H-H)=100, BE(C-C)=200, BE(C=C)=300, BE(C-H)=400\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of compound\nH_at_compound = (22 * 400) + (9 * 200) + (2 * 300)\n# H_at_compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of elements\nH_at_elements = (12 * 1000) + (22 * 0.5 * 100)\n# H_at_elements = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol\n\n# Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol)\ndelta_H_f_mol = H_at_elements - H_at_compound\n# delta_H_f_mol = 13100 - 11200 = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22\nmolar_mass = 12 * 12.0 + 22 * 1.0\n# molar_mass = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n\n# Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g)\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass\n# delta_H_f_gram = 1900 / 166 = 11.4457... kJ/g\nprint(delta_H_f_gram)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The calculation of the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of a compound from bond energies and enthalpies of atomization follows these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula and count all the chemical bonds in one molecule of the compound.**\n    The given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    Let's draw the structure to count the atoms and bonds accurately.\n    ```\n       CH3           CH3           CH3\n       |             |             |\n    H3C-C(2)=C(3)H-C(4)H2-C(5)H-C(6)H2-C(7)H=C(8)-CH3\n    ```\n    Wait, the structure in the problem is `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.
