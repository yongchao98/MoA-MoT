    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls, called atropisomers). A chiral molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Analyzing Each Compound**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n        *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Chirality**: In biphenyl systems, if there are large, bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted. This phenomenon is called steric hindrance. In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are occupied by bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Conclusion**: The significant steric hindrance prevents the molecule from being planar. The resulting twisted, non-planar conformation is chiral because it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This type of chirality is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n        *   **Structure**: This molecule is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   **Chirality**: We need to check for a chiral center. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone**:\n        *   **Structure**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality**: This molecule is achiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry cannot be chiral.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality**: The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It also has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). Any molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Decision**\n    Based on the analysis, compound **1** (due to atropisomerism) and compound **2** (due to a chiral center) exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
