    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O). These salts dissociate in water to provide the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a buffer solution.\n\n    *   Volume of solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n\n    First, calculate the moles of each component:\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n\n    Next, calculate the initial molar concentrations ([ ]₀):\n    *   [H2PO4-]₀ = 0.007348 moles / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO4^2-]₀ = 0.005618 moles / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution.**\n    The primary equilibrium that determines the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, involving the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- pair.\n    H₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n\n    We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, but it's more direct to use the Ka2 expression to find [H+]:\n    Ka2 = ([H⁺] * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n    Rearranging for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n    Assuming the initial concentrations are close to the equilibrium concentrations (a valid assumption for a buffer):\n    [H⁺] ≈ (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-].**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n    HPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka3 = ([H⁺] * [PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n    We use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-]. Since Ka3 is extremely small, the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates is negligible, so its equilibrium concentration is virtually identical to its initial concentration.\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a script for the calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99\nvolume_L = 0.20000\n\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_po4 = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\n*   We are dissolving KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O in water.\n*   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely to give K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely to give 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate) and 2H₂O.\n*   The key species are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which form a buffer system. The equilibrium that governs the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻      (Ka₂)\n\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻      (Ka₃)\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of each salt and then their initial concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n\n*   **For KH₂PO₄ (source of H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Initial Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **For Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (source of HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Initial Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\n\nThe [H⁺] in the solution is controlled by the buffer equilibrium involving Ka₂.\nKa₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻] = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for [H⁺]. We can use the initial concentrations of the buffer components because they are in significant amounts, and the change due to dissociation is negligible.\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n\nNow we use the equilibrium for the third dissociation (Ka₃) to find [PO₄³⁻].\nKa₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻] = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nRearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nWe use the [HPO₄²⁻] and the [H⁺] we just calculated.\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis result matches the output from the Python code calculation.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
