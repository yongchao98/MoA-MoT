    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the initial state and the dilution process.**\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   First, we need to calculate the initial number of moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 mol/L\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution, which will be used for the titration, is:\n    *   Concentration (Cₐ) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Analyze the titration reaction.**\n*   Acetic acid (a weak acid) reacts with sodium hydroxide (a strong base) in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   25% titration means that 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   At this point, the solution contains both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKₐ + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid. The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles.\n*   First, calculate the pKₐ from the given Kₐ:\n    *   Kₐ = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKₐ = -log₁₀(Kₐ) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles of conjugate base to the moles of acid is:\n    *   [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log₁₀(1/3) = 4.73 - log₁₀(3) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253\n    *   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**4. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.001 mol.\n*   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   At this point, the solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates completely into Na⁺ and CH₃COO⁻. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water.\n*   First, calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]):\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles of acetate / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kₑ, for acetate. We can find it using the ion product of water (Kₑ = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C) and the Kₐ of acetic acid.\n    *   Kₑ = Kₑ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   Now we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis to find the hydroxide concentration, [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]. The concentration of [CH₃COO⁻] at equilibrium will be (0.02 - x).\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kₑ is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 M. So, (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option D.\n\nLet's verify with a single script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_vol_acid_cm3 = 20.00\ninitial_conc_acid_M = 0.05\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_NaOH_M = 0.1\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Step 1: Dilution\ninitial_vol_acid_L = initial_vol_acid_cm3 / 1000\nvol_water_L = vol_water_cm3 / 1000\ninitial_moles_acid = initial_conc_acid_M * initial_vol_acid_L\ntotal_vol_diluted_L = initial_vol_acid_L + vol_water_L\nconc_acid_diluted_M = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_diluted_L\n\n# Step 2: pH at 25% titration\n# Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Step 3: pH at equivalence point\n# Moles of NaOH needed = initial_moles_acid\nmoles_NaOH_eq = initial_moles_acid\n# Volume of NaOH needed\nvol_NaOH_eq_L = moles_NaOH_eq / conc_NaOH_M\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = total_vol_diluted_L + vol_NaOH_eq_L\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate)\nconc_conj_base_M = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb_conj_base = Kw / Ka_acid\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = x^2 / (C - x) ~= x^2 / C\n# x = [OH-]\nhydroxide_conc = math.sqrt(Kb_conj_base * conc_conj_base_M)\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(hydroxide_conc)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we calculate the number of moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) in the initial solution.\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M (mol/L)\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Next, the solution is diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. The number of moles of acetic acid does not change, but the total volume does.\n    *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetic acid solution that we will titrate is:\n    *   New Concentration (Cₐ) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) → CH₃COONa (aq) + H₂O (l)\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains unreacted.\n*   At this point, the solution contains a significant amount of both a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which constitutes a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pH of this buffer:\n    pH = pKₐ + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n*   First, calculate the pKₐ from the given Kₐ:\n    pKₐ = -log₁₀(Kₐ) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and thus concentrations) of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    [A⁻] / [HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log₁₀(1/3) = 4.73 - log₁₀(3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains 0.001 mol of the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   First, we must find the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point. We need to calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to neutralize 0.001 mol of acid.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   The total volume at the equivalence point is the sum of the diluted acid volume and the added NaOH volume:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   The concentration of the sodium acetate (which fully dissociates to Na⁺ and CH₃COO⁻) is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will react with water (hydrolysis) to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of OH⁻. We use the base dissociation constant, Kₑ, for acetate.\n    *   Kₑ = Kₑ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    *   Kₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then [CH₃COOH] = x and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 M (since x is very small).\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>"
