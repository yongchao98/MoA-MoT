    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   **Clue about Gas W:** The gas W released has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n        *   ²H₂ or D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). This is a strong candidate, especially given the next clue.\n        *   ⁴He (Helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). Unlikely to be a product of a violent chemical reaction.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p=n). Possible, but less likely in this context.\n        *   The clue that \"Substance X ... incorporat[es] a heavier isotope\" strongly suggests we are dealing with deuterium (D or ²H). Therefore, **Gas W is most likely D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Substance B:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Thus, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Precipitate G:** Since heating G produces D₂O, G must be a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen and is thermally unstable. A common example is a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O. For G to be a precipitate, the corresponding metal hydroxide must be insoluble in water. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, **G is likely Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide)**.\n\n    *   **Putting it all together to identify X and Y:**\n        *   We have a reaction where Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and Al(OD)₃ precipitate.\n        *   `X + Y → D₂(g) + Al(OD)₃(s)`\n        *   For the products to contain D, Al, and O, the reactants X and Y must supply these elements. The reaction releases D₂, so X is likely a deuteride (a compound containing D⁻ ions). Since the precipitate is Al(OD)₃, X must contain aluminum. A compound containing both aluminum and deuterium is aluminum deuteride or a complex deuteride.\n        *   The most common and highly reactive reagent fitting this description is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Its reaction with heavy water (D₂O) would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD`\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and an Al(OD)₃ precipitate (G). The other product, LiOD, is soluble. This scenario perfectly fits all the clues. Thus, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Verify with the Organic Chemistry Clue:**\n\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" LiAlD₄ (X) and its analog LiAlH₄ are both powerful reducing agents widely used in organic synthesis. This confirms our identification.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" An α-keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone (C=O) group and the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The product is a diol, R-CD(OD)-CD₂OD (after D₂O workup), which contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This clue further solidifies that **X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements within the molecule.\n    *   The atomic numbers are: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen. The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element: Aluminum (Al). Its most common isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element: Hydrogen, as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Now, we sum the masses as requested:\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (H) = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
