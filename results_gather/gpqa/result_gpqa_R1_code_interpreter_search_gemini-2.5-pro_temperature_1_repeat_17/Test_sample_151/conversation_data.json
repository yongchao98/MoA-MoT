    "*   **Step 1: Understand the biological context.**\n    *   The experiment uses *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast).\n    *   The yeast is treated with a peptide that induces \"shmoo\" formation. Shmoo formation is the characteristic response of yeast to mating pheromones.\n    *   The formation of a shmoo involves two key cellular events:\n        1.  **Activation of a specific transcriptional program:** Genes required for mating and cell fusion are strongly upregulated.\n        2.  **Cell cycle arrest:** The cell arrests its cell cycle in the G1 phase, prior to DNA replication (S phase). This ensures that two haploid cells can fuse to form a stable diploid cell.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the experimental technique.**\n    *   The technique is Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry.\n    *   ChIP is used to isolate specific regions of chromatin along with the proteins bound to them.\n    *   The experiment aims to recover the proteome of **active chromatin**. \"Active chromatin\" refers to regions of the genome that are being actively transcribed or are poised for transcription.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate each protein complex in the context of active chromatin during shmoo formation.**\n    *   **A) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes, composed of histone proteins, are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, whether it's active (euchromatin) or inactive (heterochromatin). Any successful chromatin immunoprecipitation will recover large amounts of histone proteins. Therefore, this complex will be highly abundant.\n    *   **B) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC assembles at the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. Since the shmoo response involves the strong activation of many mating-specific genes, the PIC will be heavily recruited to these active promoters. As the experiment is designed to recover active chromatin, the PIC is expected to be abundant.\n    *   **D) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA elements that bind transcription factors to boost the transcription of specific genes. The pheromone response in yeast is mediated by the transcription factor Ste12, which binds to specific enhancer-like sequences called Pheromone Response Elements (PREs). To drive the high levels of transcription needed for shmoo formation, these enhancer complexes will be assembled and active. Therefore, they will be a key part of the active chromatin and are expected to be abundant.\n    *   **C) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-RC assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase to \"license\" them for DNA replication in the subsequent S phase. While yeast cells forming a shmoo are arrested in G1 (the phase where pre-RCs assemble), a critical part of the pheromone response is to **prevent** entry into S phase and thus **block DNA replication**. The cell's machinery is actively focused on transcription for mating, not on preparing for cell division. Although pre-RCs are present on the chromatin at origins, the process they regulate (replication) is inactive. In an assay specifically targeting the proteome of *active* chromatin (implying transcriptionally active), the machinery for a deliberately *inactivated* process like replication would be the least represented. The cell's \"active\" state is geared towards transcription, not replication.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude.**\n    The complexes involved in active transcription (PIC and enhancer complexes) and the basic chromatin structure (nucleosomes) will be abundant in a sample of active chromatin from a shmooing yeast cell. The pre-replication complex, associated with the process of DNA replication which is actively inhibited during the pheromone response, will be the least abundant or least represented in the proteome associated with the cell's *active* processes.\n\n<<<C>>>"
