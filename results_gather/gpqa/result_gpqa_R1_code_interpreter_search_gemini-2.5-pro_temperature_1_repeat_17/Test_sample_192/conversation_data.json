    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Given:** The number of stars (`N`) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax (`plx`) as `N ~ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   **To find:** How the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) changes with distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Relationships:**\n    *   The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance is that they are inversely proportional. Parallax (`plx`) is defined as `plx = 1/r`, where `r` is the distance to the star.\n    *   The problem states `N ~ 1/plx^5`.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Information:**\n    *   The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" can be ambiguous. It could mean:\n        a) The number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`.\n        b) The cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater* than a certain value `plx`, which we can write as `N(>plx)`.\n    *   In astronomy, star counts are very commonly expressed as a cumulative function (e.g., the number of stars brighter than a certain magnitude, or the number of galaxies closer than a certain redshift). The cumulative count `N(>plx)` is a standard formulation. For instance, for a uniform spatial distribution of stars, the number of stars with parallax greater than `p` is proportional to `1/p^3`. The problem gives a different power, `1/p^5`, which simply implies a non-uniform distribution.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely interpretation is that the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` is what's given. So, `N(>plx) ~ 1/plx^5`.\n\n4.  **Translate from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to find the relationship in terms of distance `r`, not parallax `plx`.\n    *   We use the relation `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   A parallax *greater* than `plx` (`p' > plx`) corresponds to a distance *less* than `r` (`1/r' > 1/r` => `r' < r`).\n    *   So, the number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` is the same as the number of stars with distance less than `r`. Let's call this cumulative number `N(<r)`.\n    *   Now, substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given relation:\n        `N(<r) = N(>plx) ~ 1/plx^5 = 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5`.\n    *   So, the total number of stars within a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Quantity:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars... per unit range of distance, `r`\". This is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n    *   We have the cumulative number `N(<r) ~ r^5`.\n    *   We need to differentiate this with respect to `r`.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr [N(<r)]`\n    *   Let `N(<r) = C * r^5` for some constant `C`.\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5) = C * 5 * r^(5-1) = 5C * r^4`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    *   `dN/dr ~ r^4`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The result `~ r^4` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
