    "This problem requires us to find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle in a given two-dimensional potential. The key to solving this problem is to express the potential in a coordinate system where the Schrödinger equation becomes separable. The potential is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n$V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\nIt is often advantageous to switch to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ if the potential simplifies. The transformation relations are:\n$x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n$y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nUsing these relations, we can rewrite the terms in the potential:\nThe term $r^2$ is simply $x^2 + y^2$.\nThe term $r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$ can be rewritten as $(r \\cos(\\theta))^2 = x^2$.\n\nNow, substitute these back into the potential expression:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (x^2)$\n\nLet's simplify this expression by combining the terms with $x^2$:\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\nThis potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning it can be written as a sum of a function of $x$ and a function of $y$:\n$V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\nwhere $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$ and $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$.\n\nThis form of potential corresponds to a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n$H\\psi = E\\psi$\nwhere the Hamiltonian is $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}) + V_x(x) + V_y(y)$.\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of two independent one-dimensional Hamiltonians, $H = H_x + H_y$, and the total energy is the sum of the energies associated with each dimension, $E = E_x + E_y$. The wavefunction is a product of the wavefunctions for each dimension, $\\psi(x, y) = \\psi_x(x)\\psi_y(y)$.\n\nLet's analyze each one-dimensional problem separately.\n\n1.  **Motion in the x-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$. The standard form for a 1D harmonic oscillator potential is $\\frac{1}{2} k_{eff} x^2$.\n    Comparing the two, we have $\\frac{1}{2} k_{eff,x} = 2k$, which gives an effective spring constant $k_{eff,x} = 4k$.\n    The angular frequency of the oscillator in the x-direction is $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,x}}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$. Therefore, for the x-direction:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$\n    where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the x-oscillator.\n\n2.  **Motion in the y-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$. This is already in the standard form.\n    The effective spring constant is $k_{eff,y} = k$.\n    The angular frequency of the oscillator in the y-direction is $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,y}}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    where $n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the y-oscillator.\n\nThe total energy spectrum $E$ is the sum of the energies from the x and y motions:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression by factoring out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n$E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left[ 2n_x + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) \\hbar\\sqrt(k/m))$\nB) $E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) \\hbar\\sqrt(k/m))$\nC) $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)\\hbar\\sqrt(k/m)$\nD) $E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) \\hbar\\sqrt(k/m))$\n\nOur derived energy spectrum matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
