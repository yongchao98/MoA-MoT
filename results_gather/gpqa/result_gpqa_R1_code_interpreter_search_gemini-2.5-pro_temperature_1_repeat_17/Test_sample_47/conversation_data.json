    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to substitute one of the alpha-hydrogens with a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br2\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Favorskii rearrangement. An α-haloketone with an available α'-proton (a proton on the other side of the carbonyl) reacts with a strong base like NaOH to undergo a ring contraction.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, breaking the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6) to form a more stable carbanion on the cyclopentane ring.\n    5.  Protonation of this carbanion (during workup, which is implicit before the next step) yields a carboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after an assumed acidic workup).\n\n \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl atom. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(OtBu)3\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n \n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by examining the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type of H)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type of H)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are adjacent to C1. They are equivalent to each other due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. One proton is cis to the aldehyde group and the other is trans. The same applies to C5. By symmetry, the cis-protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent, and the trans-protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent. This gives two distinct signals for these four protons. (2 types of H)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent to each other by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, this gives another two distinct signals for these four protons. (2 types of H)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1 H: 1\n*   C2/C5 H's: 2\n*   C3/C4 H's: 2\n*   **Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>"
