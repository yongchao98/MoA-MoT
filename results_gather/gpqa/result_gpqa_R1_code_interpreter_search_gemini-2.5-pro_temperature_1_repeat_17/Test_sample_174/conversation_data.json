    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical System and Radiated Power**\n\nThe problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a specific shape (spheroid) and a symmetry axis (z-axis). An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) depends on the nature of the oscillation, the angle of observation (θ), and the frequency (or wavelength λ) of the oscillation. This radiated power per unit solid angle is the function `f(θ, λ)` mentioned in the problem.\n\nThe radiation can be described by a multipole expansion. The dominant term is usually the lowest-order non-zero term. The main candidates for a simple oscillating source are:\n*   Electric Dipole Radiation\n*   Magnetic Dipole Radiation\n*   Electric Quadrupole Radiation\n\n**2. Analyze the Electric Dipole Radiation Model**\n\nThis is the most common and fundamental type of radiation from a compact oscillating source. It's the leading term in the multipole expansion. We should consider this model first.\n\n*   **Angular Dependence:** For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the radiated power per unit solid angle is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where θ is the angle with the oscillation axis (the z-axis).\n\n*   **Maximum Power (A):** The function `sin²(θ)` is maximum when `θ = 90°`, where `sin²(90°) = 1`. So, the maximum power `A` is proportional to 1.\n    `A ∝ 1`\n\n*   **Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power at an angle of 30°.\n    `P(30°) ∝ sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\n*   **Fraction of Maximum Power:** The fraction of the maximum power at θ = 30° is:\n    `Fraction = P(30°) / A = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The power radiated by an electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴).\n    `P ∝ ω⁴`\n    Since `ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ`, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`.\n    `P ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\n*   **Conclusion for Dipole Model:** This model gives a fraction of **1/4** and a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Electric Quadrupole Radiation Model**\n\nThe problem statement specifically mentions a \"spheroid in shape\". A sphere is a special case of a spheroid. The fact that a non-spherical shape is specified could be a hint that the shape itself is important. The electric quadrupole moment is a measure of a charge distribution's deviation from spherical symmetry. An oscillation of the spheroid's shape (like a \"breathing\" or \"squashing\" mode) can have a zero net dipole moment but a time-varying quadrupole moment, making quadrupole radiation the dominant mechanism.\n\n*   **Angular Dependence:** For the simplest type of electric quadrupole oscillation along the z-axis (a linear quadrupole), which is consistent with the symmetry of a spheroid, the radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n\n*   **Maximum Power (A):** We need to find the angle at which `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` is maximum.\n    `g(θ) = (sinθcosθ)² = (1/2 * sin(2θ))² = 1/4 * sin²(2θ)`\n    This function is maximum when `sin²(2θ) = 1`, which occurs at `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\n    The maximum power `A` is proportional to the value of `g(45°)`.\n    `A ∝ g(45°) = sin²(45°)cos²(45°) = (1/√2)² * (1/√2)² = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4`\n\n*   **Power at θ = 30°:** We calculate the value of `g(θ)` at 30°.\n    `P(30°) ∝ g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`\n\n*   **Fraction of Maximum Power:** The fraction is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power.\n    `Fraction = P(30°) / A = (3/16) / (1/4) = (3/16) * 4 = 12/16 = 3/4`\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The power radiated by an electric quadrupole is proportional to the sixth power of the angular frequency (ω⁶).\n    `P ∝ ω⁶`\n    Since `ω ∝ 1/λ`, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁶`.\n    `P ∝ λ⁻⁶`\n\n*   **Conclusion for Quadrupole Model:** This model gives a fraction of **3/4** and a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁶**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nWe have two physically valid models leading to two different options:\n*   Option B: (1/4, λ⁻⁴) based on the electric dipole model.\n*   Option D: (3/4, λ⁻⁶) based on the electric quadrupole model.\n\nIn physics problems, details are often included for a reason. The specific mention of a \"spheroid\" shape, which is non-spherical, strongly suggests that the quadrupole moment (which quantifies this non-spherical nature) is relevant. An oscillation of the shape itself is a natural way to generate quadrupole radiation. Therefore, the quadrupole model is the most likely intended interpretation of the problem statement.\n\nThus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at θ = 30° is 3/4, and a possible form of the power's dependence on wavelength is λ⁻⁶.\n\n<<<D>>>"
