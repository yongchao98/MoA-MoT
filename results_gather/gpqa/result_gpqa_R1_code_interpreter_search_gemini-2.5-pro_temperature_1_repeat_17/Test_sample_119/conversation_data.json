    "*   **1. Understanding the setup:**\n    *   The problem assumes that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number density is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    *   `ρ = N/V = constant`\n\n*   **2. Relating the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars, `N(d)`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth).\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V(d) = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is `N(d) = ρ * V(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n*   **3. Finding the number of stars in a thin shell:**\n    *   We are interested in how the number of stars changes with a property, so we need to consider a small interval. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   This can be found by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`:\n        `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] = ρ * 4πd²`\n    *   So, the number of stars in the shell of thickness `dd` is:\n        `dN = (ρ * 4πd²) dd`\n    *   This equation tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n*   **4. Introducing Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance `d`. The standard definition is `plx = 1/d`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   From this relationship, we can express `d` in terms of `plx`: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n*   **5. Connecting the differentials of distance and parallax:**\n    *   We need to find how the interval `dd` relates to an interval in parallax, `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the expression `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   When considering the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    *   `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n*   **6. Finding the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN` from step 3.\n    *   `dN = (ρ * 4πd²) dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`:\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π * (1/plx)²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π * 1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n*   **7. Final result:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `ρ` (the star density) and `4π` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
