    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents: a halogen (-X) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n*   Let's identify the 2-carbon, carbonyl-containing group. The most common and simple structures are:\n    *   An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This has 2 carbons and a C=O.\n    *   A **(phenyl)acetaldehyde** group (-CH2CHO). This also has 2 carbons and a C=O.\n    *   A **(phenyl)acetic acid** group (-CH2COOH). This also fits.\n\n*   This leads to two primary candidate structures:\n    1.  **Halo-acetophenone:** A halogen and an acetyl group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    2.  **Halo-phenylacetaldehyde:** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n    3.  **Halo-phenylacetic acid:** A halogen and a -CH2COOH group on a benzene ring (X-C6H4-CH2COOH).\n\n*   All these candidates have 8 carbons, are di-substituted aromatic rings, and contain the required functional groups. All would have a molecular formula of C8H7XO, which means they have 7 hydrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the deduced structures. The total integration for a C8H7XO compound should be 7H.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum shows no signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm). This is inconsistent with an aromatic compound. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum suggests the structure is halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: This is the characteristic chemical shift for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets for the aromatic protons is characteristic of **para (1,4) substitution**.\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: This is a plausible shift for a **methylene group** (-CH2-) situated between a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Plausibility Check:** While the signals match the expected types of protons, the chemical shifts for the aromatic protons (`7.8` and `7.6` ppm) are unusually high (deshielded) for a ring substituted with a weakly electron-withdrawing group like -CH2CHO. This makes the option suspect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one proton at 6.9 ppm. This is inconsistent. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7H. This is correct.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum suggests the structure is halo-acetophenone.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Again, this pattern indicates **para (1,4) substitution**. The chemical shifts are appropriate for a ring substituted with a strongly electron-withdrawing group.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a characteristic chemical shift for the protons of a **methyl ketone** (-COCH3). The signal is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Plausibility Check:** The structure p-halo-acetophenone is perfectly consistent with this NMR data. The strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3) deshields the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield to the observed 7.6-7.8 ppm range. The methyl ketone protons are correctly represented by the singlet at 2.3 ppm.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\n\nComparing options B and D, both represent plausible structures that fit the initial description. However, the chemical shifts in option D are much more consistent with its corresponding structure (p-halo-acetophenone) than the shifts in option B are with its corresponding structure (p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde). The high chemical shift of the aromatic protons (7.8 ppm) strongly points to a powerful, directly-attached electron-withdrawing group like an acetyl group, not a group insulated by a CH2 unit.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data belongs to a halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>"
