    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation helps determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a definitive indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. Its position is characteristic of an **ester C=O stretch**, often seen around 1715-1735 cm⁻¹. It is generally too high for an amide (typically <1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet signal integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet signal integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Combined:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together form the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm strongly suggests that the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom, as in an ester linkage (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid or water.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n1.  We have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n2.  The substituents are a **primary amine (-NH₂)** and an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n3.  The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the protons ortho to it. The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields the protons ortho to it.\n4.  Placing the -NH₂ group at position 1 and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group at position 4 on the benzene ring fits the NMR data perfectly:\n    *   The protons ortho to the ester group (EWG) are deshielded and appear at **8.0 ppm**.\n    *   The protons ortho to the amine group (EDG) are shielded and appear at **7.0 ppm**.\n\nThe resulting structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide. The IR and NMR aromatic patterns would be different.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, primary amine, para-substituted ring, and an ethyl ester group with the correct chemical shifts.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl (C=O), and its CH₂ signal would be around 2.5-2.8 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band, and the NMR would show signals for a formyl proton (-CHO) and only one NH proton.\n\n<<<B>>>"
