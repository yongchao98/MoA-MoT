    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A, B, and C**\n\n*   **Compound A** has the molecular formula C3H6. This formula corresponds to an alkene, specifically **propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**, as it undergoes an addition reaction with bromine.\n*   The reaction of propene (A) with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is an electrophilic addition reaction. The double bond breaks, and a bromine atom adds to each carbon of the former double bond.\n    CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    Thus, **Compound B** is **1,2-dibromopropane**.\n*   **Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane)** reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This reagent causes dehydrohalogenation. Using two equivalents of alcoholic KOH will remove two molecules of HBr to form an alkyne.\n    CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alc.) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    Thus, **Compound C** is **propyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound D**\n\n*   **Compound C (propyne)** is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic reaction of cyclic polymerization. Three molecules of propyne will trimerize to form a symmetrically substituted benzene ring.\n    3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    Thus, **Compound D** is **mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound E**\n\n*   **Compound D (mesitylene)** reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This indicates a nitration reaction, using concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The methyl groups (-CH3) are ortho-para directing and activating. In mesitylene, all three available positions (2, 4, 6) are equivalent and highly activated. Nitration will occur at one of these positions.\n    Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    Thus, **Compound E** is **2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound F**\n\n*   **Compound E (2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene)** reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n    2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n    Thus, **Compound F** is **mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline)**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound G**\n\n*   **Compound F (mesidine)**, a primary aromatic amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), typically generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures (0-5 °C). This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the amino group to a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    Mesidine + NaNO2/HCl (0-5 °C) → 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride\n    Thus, **Compound G** is **2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound H**\n\n*   **Compound G (the diazonium salt)** reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt, especially in the presence of a base, causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a phenol.\n    2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride + NaOH/H2O (warm) → 2,4,6-trimethylphenol + N2 + NaCl\n    Thus, **Compound H** is **2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitol)**.\n\n**Step 7: Evaluate the Statements**\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride (FeCl3) test is used to detect phenols. Most phenols give a characteristic purple, green, or blue color. However, phenols with bulky groups at both ortho positions (the carbons next to the -OH group) are sterically hindered and do not form the colored complex with Fe3+. Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a **negative** ferric chloride test. A neutral FeCl3 solution is yellow-brown, so the solution will remain yellow-brown, but this is not considered \"giving a yellow color\" in the context of a positive test. The statement is incorrect because it implies a positive or characteristic reaction that does not occur.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    Compound F is mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline). Aniline and its derivatives are fundamental precursors in the synthesis of azo dyes. They are diazotized and then coupled with other aromatic compounds to produce a vast range of colors. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to its high symmetry, all three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing one signal for their 9 protons. All three aromatic protons are also chemically equivalent, producing a second signal for these 3 protons. Since there are no adjacent protons for coupling, both signals are singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **D) C is a flammable gas.**\n    Compound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at room temperature. Like other small alkynes and alkanes, it is flammable. This statement is correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements B, C, and D are correct descriptions of the compounds involved. Statement A is incorrect because 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (H) is too sterically hindered to give a positive ferric chloride test.\n\n<<<A>>>"
