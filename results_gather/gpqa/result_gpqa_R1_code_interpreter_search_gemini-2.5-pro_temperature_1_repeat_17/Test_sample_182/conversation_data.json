    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Structure:** First, let's determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant from its IUPAC name.\n    *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: This is the parent structure, a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), and by convention, it is at position C1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) + 1 in the formyl group (-CHO) + 2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** Let's count the hydrogens on each carbon: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H). Then add the hydrogens from the functional groups: -COOH(1H), -CHO(1H), -CH=CH2(3H).

Determine the Product**\n\nWe apply the reducing action of Red P / HI to each part of the reactant molecule:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is hydrogenated to a `cyclohexane` ring. The double bond inside the ring is removed.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) at C1 is fully reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) at C2 is fully reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is hydrogenated to an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon that contains one ring. The carbon count remains the same.\n*   **Product Carbon Count:** The reactant had 10 carbons, so the product also has 10 carbons.\n*   **Product Type:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a type of cycloalkane.\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring (a monocyclic alkane) is **CnH2n**. Since our product has 10 carbons (n=10), its molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. A ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD of the product is 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is:\n    IHD = x - (y/2) + 1\n    Let's use a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of carbon atoms in the product\nC = 10\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in the product\nH = 20\n# IHD formula for a hydrocarbon: C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = C - (H / 2) + 1\nprint(int(IHD))\n```\n<execute_code>\n1\n</execute_code>\nBoth methods confirm that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 1\nC) 3\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reduction reaction. This set of reagents is known to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and saturate carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

This contains a carbon-oxygen double bond.\n    *   A formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO). This contains a carbon-oxygen double bond.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2). This contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    Red P / HI is a strong reducing agent that will:\n    *   Reduce the carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the aldehyde (-CHO) groups completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Reduce the carbon-carbon double bond in the ring and the one in the vinyl group to single bonds.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `formyl` group at C2 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group at C5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule containing a single ring and no multiple bonds.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, is calculated based on the number of rings and multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   Each ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   Each double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   Each triple bond contributes 2 to the IHD.\n\n    The product is a saturated cycloalkane derivative. It has **one ring** and **zero** double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The reactant has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, 2 in vinyl). The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. The final product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) with 10 carbons. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Thus, the product's formula is C10H20.\n\n    Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
