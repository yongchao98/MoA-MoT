    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe problem describes a particle-antiparticle annihilation where a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and transform into four new particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). The fundamental principles that govern this interaction are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before must equal the total momentum after.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\n*   The system consists of a proton and an antiproton.\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a standard approximation in particle physics problems, meaning its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can assume the system is effectively at rest in the lab frame.\n*   **Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):** Since the particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n    $P_{initial} \\approx 0$\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** With negligible kinetic energy, the initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest energy is given by Einstein's famous equation, $E=mc^2$.\n    *   A proton and an antiproton have the same mass. The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is a known physical constant, approximately 938 MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = (m_p c^2) + (m_{\\bar{p}} c^2) = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   The system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives us the rest energy: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Final Momentum ($P_{final}$):** Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. The four particles must fly away from the collision point in such a way that their vector momenta cancel each other out.\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four resulting particles. The total energy of a single moving particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is its speed.\n    *   By symmetry (since the initial state was at rest and the final particles are identical in mass), the energy released in the annihilation will be distributed equally among the four particles. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n    *   Therefore, the total final energy is:\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for Velocity**\n\nNow, we set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can solve this equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the known values for the rest energies:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938}{600} \\approx 1.563$\n\nFinally, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. It is easiest to solve for $\\beta = v/c$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.769$\n\nSo, the velocity of each particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\n\n*   A) 0.91c\n*   B) 0.96c\n*   C) 0.77c\n*   D) 0.86c\n\nOur calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
