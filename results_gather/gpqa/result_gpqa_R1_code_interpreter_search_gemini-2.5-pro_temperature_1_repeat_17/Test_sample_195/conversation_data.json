    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the physical system and the principles involved.**\nThe problem describes a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The key principle to use here is the conservation of total energy. The total energy of a relativistic particle is the sum of its kinetic energy, potential energy, and rest mass energy.\n\n**2. Define the total energy of the system.**\nThe total relativistic energy (E) of a particle with rest mass $m$, moving at a speed $v$, in a potential $U(x)$ is given by:\n$E = T + U(x) + E_0$\nwhere:\n*   $T = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$ is the relativistic kinetic energy.\n*   $E_0 = mc^2$ is the rest mass energy.\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\nCombining these terms, the total energy is:\n$E = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + U(x) + mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\nThis total energy $E$ is a conserved quantity for the oscillator.\n\n**3. Determine the potential energy.**\nThe force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is the work done against this force to move the mass from the equilibrium position (x=0) to a position x.\n$U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = -\\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**4. Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\nWe will equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n*   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude (x = A).** At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is zero ($v=0$).\n    *   $v=0 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma(v=0)mc^2 + U(A) = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium position (x = 0).** At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is maximum ($v = v_{max}$).\n    *   $v = v_{max} \\implies \\gamma = \\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + U(0) = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\nSince energy is conserved, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n$E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n**5. Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\nFirst, solve the energy conservation equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNow, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n$\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, it's easier to first solve for $v^2/c^2$ in terms of $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}$\n$1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ into this equation for $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**6. Check the other options.**\n*   A) Dimensionally inconsistent.\n*   B) This is the non-relativistic (classical) result, which cannot be correct for a relativistic problem.\n*   C) This would lead to a speed greater than the speed of light, which is physically impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only physically and mathematically correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
