    "This problem requires us to determine the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH will be determined by the substance that is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react first with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    *   Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n    *   The H+ is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = Initial OH- - Moles of H+ reacted\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\nNow, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    *   Initial moles of OH- (from Reaction 1) = 0.10 mol\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   The weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = Moles of OH- - Moles of CH3COOH reacted\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess substance.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH- ions, which will determine the pH. First, we need to find the total volume of the solution.\n\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the final concentration of OH-.\n\n*   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution.**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167)\n    *   pOH ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   In aqueous solutions at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
