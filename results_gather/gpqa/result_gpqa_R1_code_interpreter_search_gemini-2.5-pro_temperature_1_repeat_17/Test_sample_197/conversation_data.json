    "This problem requires us to calculate the mole fraction of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 1. Identify the Species and Equilibria\n\nThe species containing cobalt in the solution are the free aquated ion `Co²⁺` and the various thiocyanato complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻`.\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β):\n1.  `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺` ; `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n2.  `Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n3.  `Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]⁻` ; `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)3]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n4.  `Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]²⁻` ; `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)4]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n### 2. Define the Total Cobalt Concentration\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)4]²⁻]`\n\n### 3. Express Concentrations in Terms of [Co²⁺]\n\nWe can rearrange the stability constant equations to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the respective stability constant:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂)\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its mole fraction (`α₂`) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction is the concentration of the specific complex divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from the previous steps:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n### 5. Substitute the Given Values and Calculate\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it `D`):\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n`D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`D = 2.3646`\n\nNext, calculate the value of the numerator (the term corresponding to `[Co(SCN)2]`):\n`Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n`Percentage = α₂ * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nWe can confirm the calculation with a simple python script.\n```python\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nL = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator which is the sum of terms for all species\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*L + beta2*(L**2) + beta3*(L**3) + beta4*(L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n```output\n16.91618032648228\n```\nThe result of the calculation is 16.916%, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The goal is to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is equivalent to calculating the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibrium expressions:**\nThe total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)4]²⁻]`\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentrations of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and the ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**2. Formulate the mole fraction expression:**\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `α₂`, is given by:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium expressions into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out the `[Co²⁺]` term:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)` into the mole fraction equation:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression. This is a key point: the fraction of each species depends only on the ligand concentration, not the total metal concentration.\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Substitute the given values and calculate:**\nGiven:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nCalculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex:\n`Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**4. Convert to percentage:**\n`Percentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the one from the code execution.\n\n<<<A>>>"
