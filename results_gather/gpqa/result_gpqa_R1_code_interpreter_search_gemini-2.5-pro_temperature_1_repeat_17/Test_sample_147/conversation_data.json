    "To solve this problem, we need to systematically identify the unknown element Y and the series of its fluoride compounds (A1 to A5).\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe cornerstone of the problem is the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96% (or 0.3196). A2 is a binary fluoride with the general formula YFₙ.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   n = number of fluorine atoms\n*   Ar(F) = atomic weight of fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol)\n*   Ar(Y) = atomic weight of element Y\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for Ar(Y):\n0.3196 = (19.00n) / (Ar(Y) + 19.00n)\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) + 0.3196 × 19.00n = 19.00n\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\nWe can now test integer values of n to find a corresponding element Y with a plausible atomic weight.\n*   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (close to Ca or K)\n*   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (close to Br)\n*   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 (close to Sb)\n*   n=4: Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 (close to Dy)\n*   n=5: Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 (close to Hg or Tl)\n*   n=6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 (close to Pu or Am)\n\nWe are looking for an element Y that can form five binary fluorides and whose compounds are strong oxidizing agents (capable of oxidizing xenon). This points towards elements in high oxidation states, such as the platinum group metals or actinides.\n\nLet's test these candidates. A particularly interesting candidate arises for n=4:\nIf n=4, Ar(Y) = 40.45 × 4 = 161.8 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic weight of **Dysprosium (Dy)**, which is 162.5 g/mol.\n\nLet's verify the mass fraction for DyF₄:\nɷF(DyF₄) = (4 × 19.00) / (162.5 + 4 × 19.00) = 76 / 238.5 ≈ 0.31865 or 31.87%.\nThis value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a difference of only 0.3%. This is a very strong match.\n\nSo, let's proceed with the hypothesis that **Y = Dy (Dysprosium)** and **A2 = DyF₄**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Compounds**\n\nNow we use the rest of the information to identify A1, A3, A4, and A5, assuming they are all fluorides of Dysprosium.\n*   **A1 decomposes into A2 (DyF₄) and fluorine.**\n    *   A1 → A2 + F₂  implies A1 must have a higher fluorine content than A2. This reaction would be DyFₓ → DyF₄ + F₂. A higher fluoride than DyF₄ is not known to exist.\n    *   Let's reconsider the decomposition. Maybe A1 is an unstable lower fluoride? For instance, DyF₂ might disproportionate: 2DyF₂ → Dy + DyF₄. But this does not produce fluorine gas.\n    *   What if the decomposition is A1 → A2 + Y? E.g., Dy₂F₅ → DyF₄ + Dy. This doesn't fit the description.\n    *   The most plausible chemical interpretation is that A2 is a *lower* fluoride formed from A1's decomposition.\n        *   Decomposition: **A1 → A2 + F₂**\n        *   This means A1 has a higher oxidation state than A2. If A2 = DyF₄, then A1 = DyFₓ where x>4. This is chemically unlikely.\n\nLet's reconsider the identification of Y. Let's look at the options. The molecular weights are in the range 110-240. This suggests that A4 is a reasonably heavy molecule.\n\nLet's try another candidate from our list. Y=Sb (Antimony), n=3.\n*   Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol. Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35. This is a great match.\n*   Let's assume **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n*   ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is also very close to 31.96%.\n\nLet's test the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis:\n*   **Five binary compounds of fluorine with Y:** Antimony forms SbF₃ and SbF₅. There are also reports of sub-fluorides or polymeric structures, but fitting five distinct compounds is difficult. However, in the context of a problem, we can assume such compounds exist for the sake of the puzzle.\n*   **A1 is bright-red and decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine.**\n    *   A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This means A1 is SbF₅.\n    *   Decomposition: SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. This happens at high temperatures (around 400 °C), not at 293 K. However, A1 is described as \"bright-red\". SbF₅ is a colorless liquid/solid. This is a major contradiction.\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon.** SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and can react with XeF₂ to form salts like [XeF][SbF₆], but it doesn't oxidize Xe metal itself under normal conditions.\n\nThe antimony hypothesis has significant inconsistencies with the physical and chemical properties described. The Dysprosium hypothesis, while having a problem with the decomposition reaction, fit the mass percentage well. This suggests there might be an unusual or less common reaction pathway involved, or a slight inaccuracy in the problem statement.\n\nLet's re-examine the reaction to form A5, as this is key to finding A4.\n*   **Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio)** in a hot solution.\nThis is a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with one of its compounds to form a product of intermediate oxidation state.\n*   Y(0) + Y(+n)Fₙ → 2Y(+(n/2))Fₙ/₂\n\nLet's assume the Dysprosium hypothesis is correct (Y=Dy, A2=DyF₄), despite the issue with A1's decomposition, as it was the best numerical fit.\n*   The stable oxidation states of Dysprosium are +2 and +3. DyF₂ and DyF₃ are known compounds. DyF₄ (A2) is a less stable, higher oxidation state fluoride.\n*   The comproportionation reaction would be: Dy(0) + A4 → A5.\n*   If we use the stable fluorides: Dy + DyF₃ would not be a 1:1 reaction to a stable product.\n*   However, a known high-temperature reaction is: **Dy + 2DyF₃ → 3DyF₂**. This is not 1:1.\n\nLet's consider the reverse, disproportionation: 3DyF₂ → Dy + 2DyF₃. The problem describes the opposite direction. There must be a 1:1 reaction.\nA possible reaction is **Dy + DyF₂ → 2DyF**. While DyF has been studied in the gas phase, it is not a stable bulk compound.\n\nThere seems to be a flaw in the premises if we strictly adhere to known chemistry. However, in such problems, we must find the intended answer. Let's reconsider the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` and the identities.\n\nLet's step back and look at the molecular weight of **DyF₃**.\nMW(DyF₃) = 162.5 + 3 × 19.00 = 162.5 + 57 = **219.5 g/mol**.\nThis value is very close to the upper end of range D, but not quite in it.\n\nLet's revisit the options and the molecular weights of our potential candidates for A4.\n*   A4 = DyF₄: MW = 238.5 g/mol. This fits perfectly into range **D) 220-240**.\n*   A4 = DyF₃: MW = 219.5 g/mol. This is just outside range D.\n*   A4 = DyF₂: MW = 200.5 g/mol. This is outside all ranges.\n\nIf we assume **A4 is DyF₄**, does the rest of the puzzle hold?\n*   Y = Dy\n*   A2 = DyF₄ (matches ɷF)\n*   A4 = DyF₄\n*   Reaction: Dy + DyF₄ → A5 (1:1 ratio). This would yield `Dy₂F₄` or `2DyF₂`. So, **A5 = DyF₂**.\n*   Hydrolysis of A5: `DyF₂` (A5) decomposes in water. `DyF₂ + 2H₂O → Dy(OH)₂ + 2HF`. This forms two substances. This is consistent.\n*   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes to A2 (DyF₄). This remains the main inconsistency, as no stable fluoride higher than DyF₄ is known. However, given that all other clues point towards Y=Dy and the subsequent fluorides, this might be a fictional property or refer to an unstable complex.\n*   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Dy and reacts with xenon. Fluorination of Dy gives DyF₃. If A3=DyF₃, its reaction with Xenon is not standard. Perhaps A3 refers to DyF₄ as well.\n\nGiven that A4=DyF₄ provides a molecular weight that fits perfectly into one of the ranges, and the rest of the clues can be made to fit the Dysprosium system (with one difficult point about A1), this is the most probable intended answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n1.  Element Y is identified as Dysprosium (Dy) based on the mass fraction of fluorine in A2.\n2.  A2 is identified as DyF₄.\n3.  A4 is also identified as DyF₄, which allows for a consistent 1:1 reaction with Dy to form A5 (DyF₂), which in turn has consistent hydrolysis properties.\n4.  The molecular weight of A4 (DyF₄) is calculated: MW = 162.5 + 4(19.0) = 238.5 g/mol.\n5.  This molecular weight falls squarely within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>"
