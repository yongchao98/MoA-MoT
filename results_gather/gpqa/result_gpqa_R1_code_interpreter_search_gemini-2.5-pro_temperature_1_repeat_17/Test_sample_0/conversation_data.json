    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime, there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime (Δt or τ) of a state is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n2.  **Energy Linewidth:** This uncertainty ΔE is often referred to as the natural linewidth of the energy level. For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, their energy separation must be greater than their individual linewidths. A common criterion is that the energy difference |E1 - E2| should be at least as large as the broader of the two linewidths, and preferably larger than the sum of the linewidths.\n\n3.  **Calculate Linewidths:** We can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. It's more convenient to use ħ in units of eV·s:\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For the first state (E1):**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state (E2):**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Apply Resolution Condition:** To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy broadening. The first state has a much larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) because it has a shorter lifetime. This broader linewidth will dominate the measurement. Therefore, the energy separation must be significantly larger than ΔE₁.\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

The levels would overlap too much to be resolved.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is far too small.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is also much smaller than the required separation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to allow the two energy levels to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n```python\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the uncertainty principle (ΔE ≈ ħ/τ)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.2e} eV\")\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference must be greater than the linewidths.\n# The larger linewidth determines the minimum required separation.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1\nprint(f\"To be resolvable, the energy difference must be greater than ~{required_separation:.2e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the required separation.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and choose the correct option.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial reasoning:**\n    *   The core concept is correctly identified as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relating energy and time: ΔE · Δt ≥ ħ/2.\n    *   The lifetime (τ) of a state is the relevant time uncertainty (Δt).\n    *   The energy uncertainty (ΔE) represents the \"linewidth\" or \"energy broadening\" of the quantum state.\n    *   The condition for resolving two energy levels is that their energy separation must be greater than their linewidths. The larger linewidth is the limiting factor.\n    *   The calculations for the linewidths are correct:\n        *   ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n        *   ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁).

The reasoning provided in the first step is complete and accurate. I am ready to provide the final answer. The problem asks for the minimum energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. Understand the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which in this case is the lifetime (τ) of the quantum state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThis uncertainty in energy, ΔE, is often called the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty (a broader linewidth).\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Linewidth for Each State**\n\nWe can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty for each state using ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish between two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This broader linewidth is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the two levels to be clearly resolved is:\n\nEnergy Difference |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\nEnergy Difference > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow we compare each option with the required minimum energy difference:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷). This would allow for clear resolution.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the required separation (10⁻⁸ < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷). The energy levels would overlap too much.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is significantly smaller than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also smaller than the required separation (10⁻⁹ < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it is the only option greater than the larger of the two energy linewidths.\n\n<<<A>>>"
