    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Part A)**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp³ hybridized carbon. The proton migrates from the alpha-carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, and a double bond shifts.\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a cyclic conjugated diketone. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are part of the ring's double bonds, meaning they are sp² hybridized. It lacks alpha-hydrogens on sp³ hybridized carbons, which is the standard requirement for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism under normal conditions.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized, and each carries two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, making them particularly acidic and mobile. The compound readily tautomerizes to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and thus exceptionally stable, so the equilibrium heavily favors the enol form. Since it can interconvert between keto and enol forms, it shows tautomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Part B)**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   Group 1: -H (Hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (Hydroxyl group)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (Methyl group)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (Methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. It will exist as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is a planar molecule (around the C=C double bond). It possesses a plane of symmetry and is achiral. It does not have any chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. (It does exhibit geometric isomerism, with its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate).\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
