    "This question requires understanding the relationship between a planet's mass, composition, and density. The key principle is **gravitational compression**.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the options:** We are given four scenarios for exoplanets and asked to determine which one would have the highest density.\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_Earth.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"Super-Earth\". For a planet with a given composition, as you add more mass, the force of gravity increases. This stronger gravitational pull compresses the planet's material, squeezing it into a smaller volume than it would otherwise occupy. This effect, known as gravitational compression, leads to a higher average density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition will be significantly denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a \"Sub-Earth\". Following the same logic as above, but in reverse, a less massive planet experiences weaker self-gravity. This results in less compression, and therefore, a lower average density compared to Earth.\n\n2.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density (a) = ρ_Earth ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > ρ_Earth (due to significant gravitational compression from 5x the mass)\n    *   Density (d) < ρ_Earth (due to lower gravitational compression from 0.5x the mass)\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the four options, the planet in option (c) is the most massive while sharing the same composition as Earth. The immense gravitational force of this 5-Earth-mass planet will compress its material far more than any of the other planets described, resulting in the highest density. The densities would be ordered as: Density(c) > Density(b) ≈ Density(a) > Density(d).\n\nTherefore, the planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive has the highest density.\n\n<<<C>>>"
