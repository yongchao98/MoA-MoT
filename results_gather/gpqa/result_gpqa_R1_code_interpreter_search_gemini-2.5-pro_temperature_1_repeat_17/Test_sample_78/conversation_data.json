    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product from the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. We are given its ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product:** The reaction is described as Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) being subjected to a reaction. Since the reaction conditions (heat, non-nucleophilic base) suggest a rearrangement or isomerization, the product will have the same molecular formula as the starting material: C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU): DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This indicates the presence of rings and/or double/triple bonds. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This signal is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl carbon (C=O). Its chemical shift suggests it's part of a conjugated system, likely a ketone.\n    *   **δ 126.9 - 144.1:** This region contains 8 carbon signals, typical for aromatic and alkene (C=C) carbons. The DoU calculation (1 for C=O, 4 for a benzene ring, 1 for a C=C bond) confirms this.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s):** These are signals for two aliphatic carbons, most likely methyl (CH₃) groups, as they are singlets in the off-resonance decoupled spectrum (or simply described as having one carbon). The shift at ~21 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring, and the shift at ~28 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d):** This A₂B₂ or AA'BB' pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** A singlet for 3 protons, consistent with a methyl group attached to the para-substituted benzene ring (a p-tolyl group).\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** Another singlet for 3 protons, consistent with a methyl group that has no adjacent protons. Given the ¹³C data, this is the methyl group of a methyl ketone (-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d):** Two doublets, each for one proton, in the alkene region. This is indicative of a trans-disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-). The downfield proton (δ 7.68) is likely β to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group, and the upfield proton (δ 6.75) is α to it.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Based on the analysis, the product contains:\n    1.  A p-tolyl group (a methyl group on a para-substituted benzene ring).\n    2.  An α,β-unsaturated ketone functional group.\n    3.  Specifically, it's a methyl ketone with a trans double bond.\n\n    Putting these pieces together, we arrive at the structure: **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n     \n\n    This structure is fully consistent with all the provided NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction is carried out by heating Compound X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base. Compound X is an epoxide (oxirane) according to the options. The transformation of a vinylic epoxide (an epoxide adjacent to a C=C double bond) into an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound is a well-known thermal or base-catalyzed rearrangement.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options for Compound X:**\n    We must find which of the given options for Compound X would rearrange to form (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. All options are vinylic epoxides. Let's first check their molecular formulas (C₁₁H₁₂O).\n\n    *   A) 2-styrylepoxide (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C₂H₃O): Formula C₉H₁₀O. **Incorrect.**\n    *   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C₂H₂(CH₃)O): Formula C₁₀H₁₂O. **Incorrect.**\n    *   C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C₂H₃O): Formula C₁₁H₁₂O. **Correct.**\n    *   D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-C₂H₃O): Formula C₁₁H₁₂O. **Correct.**\n\n    We are left with options C and D. Now we must determine which one yields the correct product.\n\n*   **Rearrangement of Option C:**\n    Compound C is **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**. Its structure is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂.\n    The rearrangement of this vinylic epoxide leads to the formation of a dienol intermediate, which then tautomerizes to the more stable ketone.\n    p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂  →  [p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂] (Dienol intermediate)\n    [p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(OH)=CH₂]  ⇌  p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ (Ketone product)\n    This reaction produces (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one, which is the exact product we deduced from the NMR data.\n\n*   **Rearrangement of Option D:**\n    Compound D is **2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**. Its structure is C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂.\n    The rearrangement would proceed similarly:\n    C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂  →  [C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-C(OH)=CH₂]  ⇌  C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-C(=O)-CH₃\n    The product would be **3-methyl-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one**. This product contains an unsubstituted phenyl group (not a p-tolyl group) and a trisubstituted double bond. Its ¹H-NMR spectrum would show a 5H multiplet for the phenyl protons and only one vinylic proton signal, which contradicts the provided spectral data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the rearrangement of Compound C, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, can form the product whose NMR spectra are given. Therefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
