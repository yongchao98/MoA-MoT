    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the 1H NMR spectrum data:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\nThe task is to identify the pair of compounds from the given options that would produce this specific NMR spectrum when mixed in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. The key is to look at the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C5 are unique and lie on the symmetry plane. This results in three distinct sets of methyl protons. They will produce **three singlets** with integrations of **6H** (for Me-1 and Me-3), **3H** (for Me-2), and **3H** (for Me-5). The integration ratio is 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair. This results in **two singlets** with integrations of **6H** (for Me-1,4) and **6H** (for Me-2,3). The integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric (like Durene).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups produce two signals: a **quartet** (from the -CH2- groups, 4H) and a **triplet** (from the -CH3 groups, 6H). The spectrum contains no alkyl singlets.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and compare them to the experimental data.\n\n**Experimental Data:**\n*   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Alkyl: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB and one singlet (4H) from 1,4-DEB. This gives two singlets in a 2:4 or 1:2 ratio. **(Mismatch)**\n*   **Alkyl:** Contains a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-DEB. The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets. **(Mismatch)**\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and one singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB. Assuming they have different chemical shifts, this gives **two singlets** in a 2:2 or **1:1 ratio**. **(Match)**\n*   **Alkyl:** One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two singlets (6H each) from 1,2,3,4-TMB. This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **(Match)**\n*   This option is a perfect match for the data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and one singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. **(Match)**\n*   **Alkyl:** One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in four distinct alkyl singlets. **(Mismatch)**\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and one singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. **(Match)**\n*   **Alkyl:** Two singlets (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. Even with a potential overlap of one of the 6H signals, this would result in at least four signals (e.g., 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), not three. **(Mismatch)**\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
