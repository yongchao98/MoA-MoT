    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign positions based on the name:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   The substituents are adjacent to each other in a 1,2,3 pattern.\n*   The relative positions are:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-directing. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para substitution over ortho.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing. This is a likely precursor to the -OEt group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing. This is often formed by reducing a -NO2 group and can be converted to -OH via a diazonium salt.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. It's also an excellent \"blocking group\" because it can be added and later removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option, starting from benzene.\n\n**Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n*   **Step i:** Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   **Step iii:** Aniline + t-BuCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on anilines because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. So, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n**Options B, C, and D** all start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n*   **Step i:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene. This is a good first step. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.\n\n**Let's analyze Option D:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n*   **Step iv:** This step uses NaNO2/HCl, which is for diazotization of an amino group. However, the product from step iii (a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene) does not have an amino group. This step is chemically incorrect in this position. So, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n**Let's analyze Option C:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n*   **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) gives p-tert-butylaniline.\n*   **Step iv:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group is a very strong ortho, para-director. It would direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to itself (and meta to the t-butyl group), yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. (Note: In practice, the amine is usually protected as an acetamide before nitration).\n*   **Step v:** Diazotization of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.\n*   **Step vi:** Reaction with H3O+/Heat converts the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n*   **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n*   This final product is a 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene, which is an isomer of the target 1,2,3-trisubstituted molecule. Furthermore, the last two steps (viii, ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which make no sense at the end of the synthesis. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n**Let's analyze Option B:**\nThis sequence uses a sulfonic acid blocking group, a common strategy for controlling substitution on an aromatic ring.\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, substitution occurs almost exclusively at the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. We have a t-butyl group (o,p-director) at C1 and a sulfonic acid group (m-director) at C4. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: C2 and C6. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step is unusual. Standard conversion of a diazonium salt to a phenol uses dilute acid and heat (step vii). Nitration of a highly deactivated ring with a diazonium salt is not feasible. There seems to be a typo in the option. Let's assume steps vi and vii are intended to convert the diazonium salt into a nitrophenol, possibly by hydrolysis to a phenol followed by nitration.\n*   Let's assume the sequence intends to first make the phenol and then manipulate the ring further.\n    *   After step v (diazotization), let's perform step vii (**H3O+, H2O/Heat**). This converts the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Now, let's perform step viii (**dilute H2SO4**, heat). This causes desulfonation (removes the -SO3H group). Product: **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Now, we need to nitrate this product using the reagent from step vi (**HNO3/H2SO4**). In 3-tert-butylphenol, the -OH group (strong o,p-director) and the -tBu group (o,p-director) are present. The -OH group at C1 directs incoming groups to positions 2, 4, and 6. Nitration will occur preferentially at position 2 or 6. Let's say nitration at position 2 occurs. Product: **2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Finally, step ix (**NaOH/EtBr**) is the Williamson ether synthesis. This converts the phenol to an ethoxy group. Final Product: **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   Let's compare this product to the target molecule:\n    *   **Product from sequence B:** 1-ethoxy, 2-nitro, 3-tert-butyl.\n    *   **Target molecule:** 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro.\n*   These are isomers; the relative positions of the t-butyl and nitro groups are swapped. Therefore, sequence B does not produce the correct target molecule.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nA rigorous analysis shows that none of the provided options correctly and logically leads to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene in high yield. The synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with this specific pattern is known to be very challenging and requires a more complex route than those presented. The options contain either chemically incorrect steps or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option in a multiple-choice scenario, one must consider the intended logic. Option B employs a sophisticated and appropriate strategy (using a blocking group) for controlling substitution, which is conceptually the right way to approach such a synthesis, even if the specifics in the option lead to an incorrect isomer due to the initial para-sulfonation. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (non-working reactions, nonsensical ordering). Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible, albeit flawed, synthetic design among the choices. Assuming a flaw in the question's design (either the target molecule or the reaction sequence), B is the most likely intended answer as it tests relevant advanced synthesis concepts.\n\nLet's assume there is a subtle aspect or an error in my final analysis of isomerism for sequence B, or a typo in the question that makes it work. Let's re-examine the nitration of 3-tert-butylphenol. Nitration could also occur at position 6, giving 6-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol. Etherification would give 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-5-tert-butylbenzene. This is also not the target. No matter how we analyze sequence B, it starts with a para-relationship between t-butyl and the sulfonic acid, which is converted to the ethoxy group, which makes an ortho-relationship as in the product impossible.\n\nGiven the severe flaws in all options, and acknowledging the difficulty of the synthesis, let's reconsider option B. Despite leading to an isomer, the strategic use of a blocking group is the most advanced and relevant chemical principle displayed. It's the most likely intended answer in a flawed question.\n\n<<<B>>>"
