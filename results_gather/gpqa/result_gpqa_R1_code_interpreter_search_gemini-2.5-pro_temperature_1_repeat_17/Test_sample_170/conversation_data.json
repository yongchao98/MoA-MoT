    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Reaction and Directing Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a monosubstituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent 'X' determines the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming bromine electrophile (Br+) will attach. This is known as the directing effect.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically electron-donating groups (activating groups), with the exception of halogens, which are deactivating. These reactions will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating groups). These reactions will produce very little of the para-isomer.\n\n### **2. Classifying the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituent in each of the six substances:\n\n1.  **ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: -CH3 (methyl) is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**: -COOC2H5 (ester) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: -Cl (chloro) is a deactivating, ortho, para-director.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: -NO2 (nitro) is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: -C2H5 (ethyl) is an activating, ortho, para-director.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: -COOH (carboxylic acid) is a deactivating, meta-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances that are meta-directors (2, 4, 6) will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer, while the ortho, para-directors (1, 3, 5) will have the highest yields.\n\n### **3. Ordering the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances 2, 4, and 6 are all meta-directors. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low for all of them. To rank them, we consider their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the ortho and para isomers.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be inversely proportional to this strength.\n*   The order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)**.\n\n### **4. Ordering the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are all ortho, para-directors. To determine the order of the *para-isomer* yield, we need to look at the para/ortho ratio. This ratio is primarily determined by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Substituents**: -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), -Cl (3).\n*   **Steric Size**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher para/ortho ratio and a higher percentage of para-isomer yield than toluene. So, **1 < 5**.\n    *   *Typical yields*: Toluene (1) gives ~67% para-isomer. Ethylbenzene (5) gives ~93% para-isomer.\n*   **Comparing with -Cl**: The chlorine atom is also sterically demanding. It is more effective at blocking the ortho position than a methyl group but slightly less effective than an ethyl group.\n    *   *Typical yields*: Chlorobenzene (3) gives ~88% para-isomer.\n*   Based on these typical experimental values, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three substances is:\n    **Toluene (1) (67%) < Chlorobenzene (3) (88%) < Ethylbenzene (5) (93%)**.\n    So, the correct order is **1 < 3 < 5**.\n\n### **5. Combining the Orders and Evaluating the Options**\n\nCombining the two groups, the complete order of increasing para-isomer yield should be:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\nNow, let's compare this derived order with the given options:\nA) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nNone of the options exactly match our derived order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5). There appears to be an error in the options, specifically in the relative ordering of chlorobenzene (3) and ethylbenzene (5).\n\nHowever, we must choose the best possible option. Let's analyze what makes Option A the most plausible choice despite the flaw:\n*   It correctly places all meta-directors (4, 6, 2) before all ortho, para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n*   It correctly orders the meta-directors based on their deactivating strength: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n*   It correctly identifies toluene (1) as having the lowest para yield among the o,p-directors.\n*   The only discrepancy is the final comparison between ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3). Option A suggests 5 < 3, while experimental data shows 3 < 5.\n\nGiven that all other options have more significant errors (e.g., incorrect ordering of meta-directors, or incorrect ordering of alkylbenzenes like 5 < 1), Option A is the \"closest\" and most likely intended answer, assuming a factual error was made by the question's author regarding the comparison of ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene.\n\nFinal Order according to Option A: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n<<<A>>>"
