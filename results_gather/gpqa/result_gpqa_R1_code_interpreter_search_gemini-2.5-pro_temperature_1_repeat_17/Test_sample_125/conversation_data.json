    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C2)-C(=O)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-CH(OCH₃)(C5)-CH₃(C6).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral, meaning it is not a stereocenter but can become one upon reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The existing chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since a new chiral center is formed at C3, and the stereochemistry at C5 is fixed as (S), two diastereomers will be formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct chemical compounds (diastereomers) are produced.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers for CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The molecule is symmetric. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are identical and represent a single meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. This is because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the enantiomers will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are produced: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers (which exist as a racemic mixture).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Compounds in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (±)-pentane-2,4-diol (a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers)\n    4.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   Compound 1 and Compound 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate into **two peaks**.\n    *   The two enantiomers in the racemic pentane-2,4-diol mixture have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not separate. They will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, it has different physical properties and will separate, giving its own **single peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) are structurally very different molecules (different carbon skeletons, functional groups, and molecular weights). They will have different retention times and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, because enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Compounds in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    *   Compound 1 and Compound 2 are diastereomers and will be separated. **Two peaks**.\n    *   Compound 3 and Compound 4 are enantiomers. A chiral column is designed to separate enantiomers. They will be resolved into **two peaks**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso form) is a distinct achiral compound. It is a diastereomer to compounds 3 and 4, so it will have a different retention time. It will appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   Again, it is assumed that there is no accidental co-elution between the five distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from the enantiomeric pair in Rxn II) + 1 peak (from the meso compound in Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
