    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are asked to find the normalized eigenvector for a spin-1/2 particle (a muon) corresponding to a spin measurement of $+\\hbar/2$ along a specific direction $\\vec{n}$.\n\n**2. Define the Spin Operators**\nThe problem provides the components of the spin operator $\\vec{P}$ (which is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted $\\vec{S}$). These are given in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\n**3. Define the Direction Vector $\\vec{n}$**\nThe direction $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector that lies in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is described by the polar angle $\\theta$ and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\nFor the vector to lie in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. We consider the general case where $\\theta$ is not fixed at 0 or $\\pi$, so we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi = 0$.\nThus, the direction vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**4. Construct the Operator Along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\nThe operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\nNow, substitute the matrix forms of the operators:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Set Up the Eigenvalue Equation**\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, where the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is given as $+\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe equation is:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**6. Solve for the Eigenvector**\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$b = a \\left( \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} \\right)$\nTo simplify this expression, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b$:\n$b = a \\left( \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**7. Normalize the Eigenvector**\nThe normalization condition is that the inner product of the state with itself is 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$|\\psi\\rangle = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe corresponding bra vector is $\\langle\\psi| = a^* \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 (1^2 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n$|a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$\nBy convention, we can choose the overall phase of the eigenvector such that $a$ is real and positive. Since $\\theta$ is a polar angle, it ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, so $\\theta/2$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi/2$, and $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is non-negative. We can choose $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n\nNow we find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is therefore:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**8. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated elements of the eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
