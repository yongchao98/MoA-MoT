    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the stationary laboratory frame where the observer is.\n    *   Let **S'** be the moving frame of the glass. This frame moves with a velocity **v** relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocity of Light in the Moving Frame (S'):**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). The speed `u'` is measured in the rest frame of the medium itself (frame S').\n    *   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n    *   The problem states to use `c = 1`.\n    *   So, `n = 1 / u'`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, as measured within the glass's own rest frame, is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   The problem asks for the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is a classic relativistic velocity addition problem.\n    *   The formula to transform a velocity `u'` from a moving frame S' (which moves at velocity `v` relative to S) to the stationary frame S is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    *   In our case:\n        *   `u` is the speed we want to find (speed of light in the moving glass relative to the lab).\n        *   `u' = 1/n` is the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass.\n        *   `v` is the speed of the glass relative to the lab.\n        *   `c = 1`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    *   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    *   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\nThis result is a famous consequence of special relativity, confirmed by the Fizeau experiment, and describes the phenomenon of \"Fresnel drag\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
