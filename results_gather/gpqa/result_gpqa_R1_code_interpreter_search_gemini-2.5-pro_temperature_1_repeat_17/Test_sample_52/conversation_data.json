    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information from the problem description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two groups attached, having a base formula of C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) have two oxygen atoms, consistent with this information.\n    *   **1H NMR data:** This is the most crucial part for determining the structure.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two aromatic proton signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry. Ortho and meta substitution would typically result in more complex patterns with more than two signals.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint. It means there are no methylene groups in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n            *   Let's denote the group as `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   The proton H(b) is coupled to one adjacent proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). Thus, its signal would be a **doublet of quartets**. This matches the description.\n            *   The proton H(a) is coupled only to the adjacent proton H(b). Thus, its signal would be a **doublet**. This also matches the description.\n            *   One of the two required -CH3 signals comes from this propenyl group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`).\n    *   We have a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This is one of the substituents. It also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   We have an ester group (`-COO-`).\n    *   We need one more methyl group (`-CH3`) to account for the second methyl signal. This methyl group must be part of the ester to satisfy the valence of all atoms.\n\n3.  **Construct the possible structures and determine the formula:**\n    There are two ways to incorporate the ester group, the propenyl group, and the second methyl group onto the para-substituted benzene ring:\n\n    *   **Case A: The benzene ring is part of the acid component of the ester.**\n        The structure is: `CH3-CH=CH` - `C6H4` - `COOCH3`. (Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate)\n        Let's sum the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from carboxyl) + 1 (from methyl ester) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 5 (from propenyl) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from ester).\n        *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    *   **Case B: The benzene ring is part of the alcohol component of the ester.**\n        The structure is: `CH3` - `COO` - `C6H4` - `CH=CH-CH3`. (4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate)\n        Let's sum the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 1 (from acetyl) + 1 (from carboxyl) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 3 (from acetyl) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from ester).\n        *   The resulting formula is also **C11H12O2**.\n\n    Both structures that perfectly match all the spectroscopic data have the same chemical formula: C11H12O2.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE formula is `C + 1 - H/2`.\n    *   For the deduced formula **C11H12O2**: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the DBE from the structure: 1 (for the benzene ring) + 3 (for the double bonds in the ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C) + 1 (for the ester C=O) = 6. The DBE matches.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This DBE is too low to accommodate a benzene ring (DBE=4), an ester C=O (DBE=1), and a vinyl C=C (DBE=1).\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This implies an extra degree of unsaturation compared to our structure (DBE=6), which is not suggested by the simple NMR data.\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. This DBE is consistent with the structural features. However, to get this formula from our core fragments (`p-C6H4`, `ester`, `propenyl`), we would need to add a CH2 unit (C11H12O2 + CH2 = C12H14O2). But the NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
