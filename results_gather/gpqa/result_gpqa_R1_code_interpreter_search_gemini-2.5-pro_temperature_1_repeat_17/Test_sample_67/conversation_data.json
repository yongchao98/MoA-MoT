    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **Particle:** A spin-1/2 particle. Its spin is described by the spin operator vector **S** = (S_x, S_y, S_z).\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment **μ** is related to the spin by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component is μ_z = γS_z.\n*   **Initial Magnetic Field:** The field is **B** = B**ẑ** (pointing in the positive z-direction).\n*   **Initial Hamiltonian:** The energy of the particle in the magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian H = -**μ** · **B**.\n    *   H = - (γ**S**) · (B**ẑ**) = -γB S_z.\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state.\n    *   The eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 (spin-up, `|↑⟩` or `|+z⟩`) and -ħ/2 (spin-down, `|↓⟩` or `|-z⟩`).\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues are E = -γB(±ħ/2).\n    *   To minimize energy, if γ > 0, we need the most negative energy, which corresponds to S_z = +ħ/2. If γ < 0, we need S_z = -ħ/2. In either case, the magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** points in the +z direction to align with **B**. The state corresponding to the spin being aligned with the +z axis is the spin-up state, `|+z⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the system at t=0 is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. The Change in the System (t > 0)\n\n*   **New Magnetic Field:** The z-field is turned off, and a new field **B'** = B**ŷ** (pointing in the positive y-direction) is turned on.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t > 0 is:\n    *   H' = -**μ** · **B'** = - (γ**S**) · (B**ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the System\n\nThe state of the particle at a later time t is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iH't/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(i(γBt/ħ)S_y) |+z⟩`\n\nThis expression describes a rotation of the initial spin state `|+z⟩` around the y-axis by an angle `θ(t) = γBt`. This physical picture is known as **Larmor Precession**.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z⟩(t)`.\n`⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n\nThe expectation value of the spin vector `⟨**S**⟩` precesses around the new magnetic field `**B'**` (the y-axis) with an angular frequency known as the **Larmor frequency**, `ω_L`.\n\n`ω_L = γB`\n\nLet's visualize this:\n*   At t=0, the spin expectation vector is pointing along the z-axis: `⟨**S**⟩(0) = (0, 0, ħ/2)`.\n*   For t>0, this vector starts to rotate in the x-z plane around the y-axis.\n*   The projection of this rotating vector onto the z-axis, `⟨S_z⟩(t)`, will oscillate.\n\nThe time-dependent value of `⟨S_z⟩` will be the initial z-component multiplied by the cosine of the angle of rotation:\n`⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨S_z⟩(0) * cos(ω_L * t)`\n`⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ * ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for `⟨μ_z⟩(t)` is a cosine function of time, `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation, ω, is the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine.\n\nFrom our result, `⟨μ_z⟩(t) ∝ cos(γBt)`, we can directly identify the angular frequency:\n\n**ω = γB**\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option D.\n\n***\n\n#### *Alternative Mathematical Derivation (using matrices)*\n\n1.  **Operators and State:**\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2)[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    *   `S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   `|+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`\n\n2.  **Time Evolution Operator:**\n    *   `U(t) = exp(i(γBt/ħ)S_y) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + isin(θ)σ_k`, let `α = γBt/2`.\n    *   `U(t) = cos(α)I + isin(α)σ_y = [[cos(α), sin(α)], [-sin(α), cos(α)]]`\n\n3.  **Evolved State:**\n    *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|+z⟩ = [[cos(α), sin(α)], [-sin(α), cos(α)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(α)], [-sin(α)]]`\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:**\n    *   `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`\n    *   `⟨ψ(t)| = [cos(α), -sin(α)]`\n    *   `S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(α)], [-sin(α)]] = (ħ/2)[[cos(α)], [sin(α)]]`\n    *   `⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(α), -sin(α)] * (ħ/2)[[cos(α)], [sin(α)]] = (ħ/2)(cos²(α) - sin²(α))`\n    *   `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2)cos(2α)`\n\n5.  **Final Result:**\n    *   Substitute `α = γBt/2` back into the equation.\n    *   `⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2)cos(2 * (γBt/2)) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   The oscillation is described by `cos(γBt)`, so the angular frequency is `ω = γB`. This confirms the previous reasoning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
