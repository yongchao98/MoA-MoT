    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2)] / [(R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2)]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P):** We don't know the orbital distances, but we can relate them to the orbital periods using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet with mass M_p much smaller than the star's mass M_star, the law is:\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This implies that a ∝ P^(2/3).\n    So, the ratio of the orbital distances is:\n    a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this relationship back into our temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(P2 / P1)^(2/3)]^(1/2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) = (P1 / P2)^(-1/3)\n\n6.  **Relate Orbital Period (P) to Radial Velocity (RV) Amplitude (K):** The problem provides information about the Doppler shift, which allows us to determine the ratio of the star's radial velocity amplitudes (K) caused by each planet. For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude is given by:\n    K ∝ M_p * P^(-1/3)\n    (where M_p is the planet's mass).\n\n7.  **Isolate the Period (P):** We can rearrange this relationship to express the period in terms of K and M_p:\n    P^(1/3) ∝ M_p / K\n    P ∝ (M_p / K)³\n    Now we can find the ratio of the periods:\n    P1 / P2 = (M_p1 / K1)³ / (M_p2 / K2)³ = (M_p1 / M_p2)³ * (K2 / K1)³\n\n8.  **Final Substitution:** Substitute this expression for P1/P2 into the temperature ratio equation from step 5:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(M_p1 / M_p2)³ * (K2 / K1)³]^(-1/3)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p1 / M_p2)^(-1) * (K2 / K1)^(-1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\n9.  **Calculate the Ratios of Mass and RV Amplitude:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ₀).\n        Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n10. **Final Calculation:** Now, plug these ratios into the final equation from step 8:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the decimal value, we can use a simple python script.\n```python\n# Ratio of planet masses (Planet2 / Planet1)\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (Planet1 / Planet2)\n# This is equivalent to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\nrv_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Final ratio of equilibrium temperatures (Temp1 / Temp2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * rv_ratio\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_ipython>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_eq is the equilibrium temperature of the planet.\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 (T_eq1) to Planet 2 (T_eq2).\nRatio = T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a):\nP² ∝ a³\nThis implies a ∝ P^(2/3). So, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\na2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n\nSubstituting this back into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(P2 / P1)^(2/3)]^(1/2) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the orbital periods (P2 / P1). We can do this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star)^(2/3)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination. Since both transit and RV methods detected the planets, we can assume the orbits are close to edge-on, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\nFor a given star, K is proportional to M_p / P^(1/3).\nK ∝ M_p * P^(-1/3)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for P:\nP^(1/3) ∝ M_p / K\nSo, P ∝ (M_p / K)³\n\nNow we can write the ratio of the periods:\nP2 / P1 = [(M_p2 / K2)³] / [(M_p1 / K1)³] = (M_p2 / M_p1)³ * (K1 / K2)³\n\nSubstitute this period ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(M_p2 / M_p1)³ * (K1 / K2)³]^(1/3)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where c and λ₀ are constants. Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts Δλ₁/Δλ₂.\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 M_earth / 7 M_earth) * (0.03 Å / 0.04 Å)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
