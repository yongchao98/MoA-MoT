    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The base peak is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. Its intensity is about 32% of the M+ peak (100:32 ratio, which is approximately 3:1). This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is very characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with. The integration of 1H confirms it represents a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both of which are doublets ('d'), and each integrates to two protons (2H). This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic fingerprint for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other side.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\n\n1.  From the IR and ¹H NMR, we know the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n2.  From the MS, we know it contains one chlorine atom.\n3.  Therefore, the compound must be a chlorobenzoic acid.\n4.  The ¹H NMR aromatic pattern (two doublets, each 2H) specifically points to a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *ortho*-substituted. It would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group required for the IR and ¹H NMR signals.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule fits all the data perfectly.\n    *   It is a **chlorobenzoic acid**.\n    *   Its molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is 156 g/mol.\n    *   It has the carboxylic acid group confirmed by IR and ¹H NMR.\n    *   It has a **para-substitution** pattern, which matches the ¹H NMR aromatic signals.\n\nThe final structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
