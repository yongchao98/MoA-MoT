    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus with rest mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its initial rest-mass energy is `E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `p_i = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. The problem states it's \"2 times more massive\", which means `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments move apart with kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after.\n    `E_i = E_f`\n    `M*c^2 = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)`\n    The total kinetic energy released (also known as the Q-value) is `Q = T1 + T2`.\n    `Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    So, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before fission equals the total momentum after.\n    `p_i = p_f`\n    `0 = p1 + p2` (as vectors)\n    This means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `|p1| = |p2|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2 = p`), we have:\n`T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n`T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3*T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThis can be rearranged to find momentum: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince total energy is `E = T + m*c^2` (where `T` is kinetic energy), we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nNow, substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n\nNow, solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV), knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
