    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (⁻CN) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n        3.  This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   `H3O⁺` (hydronium ion, representing an acidic solution): This is a strong acid and an excellent source of protons. Adding an acid (often in a subsequent workup step) will protonate the alkoxide to yield the final cyanohydrin product, `2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`. This is the standard procedure.\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite): This reagent also adds to ketones to form bisulfite addition products. It does not provide the necessary conditions for cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be an acid source, so `H3O⁺` is the correct choice.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction requires heat and water.\n        *   In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid.\n        *   In base-catalyzed hydrolysis, the nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base, which forms a carboxylate salt that must then be acidified to yield the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B:**\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid): This is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not effective for the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile. Strong acids are required for an efficient reaction.\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid): This is a strong acid. When dissolved in water (as indicated by `B (H₂O)`), it provides the H₃O⁺ ions necessary for efficient acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid catalyst, so `HCl` is the correct choice.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, `A = H₃O⁺`.\n    *   For the second reaction, `B = HCl`.\n    *   Matching these conclusions with the given options, we find that option C fits perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
