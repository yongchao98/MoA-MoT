    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Define the Energy of the System**\n\n*   The energy (Hamiltonian) of the system is given by the formula:\n    E = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)\n    where J is a constant.\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function**\n\n*   The partition function, Z, is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that describes the statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n*   It is defined as the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-β*Ei)`, where `Ei` is the energy of state `i` and `β = 1/(kT)`.\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible microstates, calculate the energy for each, and then find the corresponding Boltzmann factor.\n\nLet's list the states as (S1, S2, S3):\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n    *   **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n        E = -J * (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = -J * (1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    *   **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n        E = -J * ((-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)) = -J * (1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    *   There are **2** states with energy **E = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is different from the other two.**\n    *   **State (+1, +1, -1):**\n        E = -J * (1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = -J * (1 - 1 - 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   **State (+1, -1, +1):**\n        E = -J * (1*(-1) + 1*1 + (-1)*1) = -J * (-1 + 1 - 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   **State (-1, +1, +1):**\n        E = -J * ((-1)*1 + (-1)*1 + 1*1) = -J * (-1 - 1 + 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   **State (-1, -1, +1):**\n        E = -J * ((-1)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1) = -J * (1 - 1 - 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   **State (-1, +1, -1):**\n        E = -J * ((-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = -J * (-1 + 1 - 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   **State (+1, -1, -1):**\n        E = -J * (1*(-1) + 1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)) = -J * (-1 - 1 + 1) = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   There are **6** states with energy **E = J**.\n\n**5. Sum the Contributions to the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states. We can group the states by their energy and degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n\n*   **Contribution from states with E = -3J:**\n    *   Degeneracy (g1) = 2\n    *   Boltzmann factor = e^(-β*(-3J)) = e^(3Jβ)\n    *   Total contribution = 2 * e^(3Jβ)\n\n*   **Contribution from states with E = J:**\n    *   Degeneracy (g2) = 6\n    *   Boltzmann factor = e^(-β*J) = e^(-Jβ)\n    *   Total contribution = 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nNow, we sum these contributions to get the total partition function Z:\n\nZ = (Contribution from E=-3J) + (Contribution from E=J)\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated result, Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
