    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n        *   Alkanes (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). If n is large, this approaches 2/14 ≈ 14.3%. Let's check the given value: 14.28% is very close to 1/7.\n            (2n+2) / (14n+2) = 1/7 => 14n + 14 = 14n + 2 => 14 = 2, which is impossible.\n        *   Cycloalkanes (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match for 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent and is formed from the hydrogenation of all other compounds in mixtures X and Y. This implies a stable, common structure. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n    *   The problem also states Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a saturated compound (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X (unsaturated) undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y (saturated/unreactive to Br2 water).\n    *   Disproportionation is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it will be a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule will gain hydrogen (reduction) and another will lose hydrogen (oxidation).\n    *   Mixture Y contains Z as one of its components. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent. This implies the carbon skeleton for all compounds is a six-membered ring.\n    *   So, one component of Y is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call it C. C = C6H12.\n    *   The other component of Y, let's call it D, must also be formed in the disproportionation. It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of D must also yield Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   The most plausible \"oxidized\" product from a C6 ring that is stable and does not react with bromine water is benzene (C6H6). Aromatic compounds are unreactive towards Br2 water under standard test conditions. Severe hydrogenation of benzene does indeed produce cyclohexane.\n    *   So, we hypothesize that Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n        *   C = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. The reaction is:\n        A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D\n    *   Substituting our identified components of Y:\n        A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is an equimolar reaction producing an equimolar mixture, as stated.\n    *   Let's balance the atoms. All compounds have a C6 skeleton.\n        C6Hx + C6Hy -> C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Now we need to identify A and B from the properties of mixture X.\n        *   They are unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water). This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, so they must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n    *   Let's find C6-ring molecules that fit these descriptions and the hydrogen balance (x + y = 18).\n        *   A plausible candidate for A is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It has one double bond, is non-conjugated, and its formula is C6H10 (so x=10).\n        *   If x=10, then y must be 18 - 10 = 8. We need to find a non-conjugated C6-ring compound with the formula C6H8.\n        *   A plausible candidate for B is **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**. It has two double bonds separated by CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. Its formula is C6H8 (so y=8). Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is ruled out because it is conjugated.\n    *   So, let's propose:\n        *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)}\n\n4.  **Final Verification**\n    *   **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Both are liquids, contain double bonds (decolorize Br2 water), and are non-conjugated. This fits.\n    *   **Reaction**: Cyclohexene (C6H10) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6). This is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). The diene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the ene (C6H10) is reduced to the ane (C6H12).\n    *   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Both are liquids. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene is aromatic; neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**:\n        *   Hydrogenation of X: Cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene both hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is already Z. Benzene hydrogenates under severe conditions to cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met by this model.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Component A: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Component B: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
