As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Provided Data\n\nFirst, let's organize the resistance levels for each genotype. We assume the Wild-Type (WT) has 100% resistance.\n\n*   **WT (Control):** 100%\n*   **g1 (G1 knockout):** 75% (a 25% loss of resistance)\n*   **g2 (G2 knockout):** 0% (a 100% loss of resistance)\n*   **g3 (G3 knockout):** 50% (a 50% loss of resistance)\n*   **g1g2 (double knockout):** 0%\n*   **g1g3 (double knockout):** 10% (a 90% loss of resistance)\n*   **g2g3 (double knockout):** 0%\n\n### 2. Analyze the Role of Gene G2\n\n*   The single mutant `g2` shows a complete loss of resistance (0%). This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n*   Now, let's look at the double mutants involving `g2`. The `g1g2` mutant also has 0% resistance, which is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. Similarly, the `g2g3` mutant has 0% resistance, again the same as the `g2` single mutant.\n*   This is the definition of **epistasis**. When the phenotype of a double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, the corresponding gene is said to be epistatic to the other. In this case, the `g2` mutation masks the effects of the `g1` and `g3` mutations.\n*   In a genetic pathway, this usually means the epistatic gene (G2) acts upstream of the others. Given the information that one of the genes is a transcription factor, G2 is the most logical candidate. If G2 is a transcription factor required to turn on the resistance pathway (including G1 and G3), then knocking out G2 would shut the entire system down, making the status of G1 and G3 irrelevant.\n*   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 and is likely an upstream transcription factor.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Interaction Between G1 and G3\n\n*   The single mutants `g1` and `g3` have partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively), meaning each gene contributes to the overall resistance.\n*   If they acted in completely separate, independent pathways, we would expect their effects to be additive. The loss from `g1` is 25%, and the loss from `g3` is 50%. The expected resistance for the `g1g3` double mutant would be 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n*   However, the observed resistance for `g1g3` is only 10%. This is significantly lower than the expected additive effect. This phenomenon, where the double mutant has a much more severe phenotype than the combination of single mutant effects, is called a **synergistic interaction**.\n*   Synergism often points to **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 have overlapping or compensatory functions. They might act in parallel pathways that converge on the same outcome. When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate, so the drop in resistance is not catastrophic. But when both are knocked out, the system almost completely fails.\n*   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 act synergistically, which suggests they have redundant functions.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Epistasis between G1 and G3\n\n*   For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant (10% resistance) would have to be the same as the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). This is clearly not the case.\n*   For G3 to be epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) would have to be the same as the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). This is also not the case.\n*   **Conclusion 3:** There is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3. Their interaction is synergistic.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\nNow, let's review the options based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\": Incorrect. Pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple traits. We only have data for one trait. \"Gene redundancy\" is the correct term for their interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect.\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Incorrect. G2 is the transcription factor.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": This is a possible mechanism but cannot be concluded from this data.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct, based on our analysis.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": Correct, as this explains their synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This specific clause is incorrect, as shown in step 4.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the options, Option D contains two key correct conclusions derived directly from the data: G2 is the upstream transcription factor, and G1 and G3 have a redundant relationship. No other option captures these two essential points correctly. Although the final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, Option D is by far the best and most comprehensive description of the genetic interactions among the choices provided. It is likely that the last clause is an error in the question's options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
