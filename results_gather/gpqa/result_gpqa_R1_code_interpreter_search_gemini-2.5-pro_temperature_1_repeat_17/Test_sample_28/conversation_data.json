    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot catalyze the synthesis of the compound.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence. The process of protein synthesis, called translation, reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, called codons. Translation starts at the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Analysis:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n*   Codons are read as: `ATG`, `TTT`, `CTC`, `GCT`, `GGT`, `ACT`.\n*   Translated Amino Acids: Methionine (Start), Phenylalanine, Leucine, Alanine, Glycine, Threonine...\n*   This sequence produces a functional protein, which in turn synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Analysis of Mutant Genes:**\n\n1.  **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison: The codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   Effect: This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid in the protein (Leucine is replaced by Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might be less effective or even function normally.\n\n2.  **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison: The codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Effect: The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it terminates protein synthesis. This mutation introduces a stop codon very early in the gene (it would be the third amino acid). The result is a drastically shortened, non-functional protein fragment (containing only two amino acids). This is highly likely to completely eliminate the protein's function.\n\n3.  **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison: A single nucleotide (`T`) has been inserted after the second codon (`TTT`).\n    *   Effect: This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion shifts the entire reading frame for the rest of the gene. All codons after the insertion point will be read incorrectly, leading to a completely different and garbled amino acid sequence. This almost always results in a non-functional protein, often because a random stop codon is quickly encountered in the new reading frame. This is also highly likely to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n4.  **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’`\n    *   Comparison: Comparing to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n    *   Effect: This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one complete codon, resulting in the deletion of a single amino acid (Glycine) from the protein chain. While removing an amino acid is more severe than changing one, the rest of the protein is translated correctly. The protein might still retain partial or even full function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe are looking for the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the protein's function.\n*   Mutant 1 (missense) and Mutant 4 (in-frame deletion) might only alter the protein, not necessarily destroy its function.\n*   Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are both catastrophic mutations that will almost certainly lead to a non-functional protein.\n\nBoth nonsense and frameshift mutations are excellent candidates for knocking out a gene. However, the introduction of a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation), as seen in **Mutant 2**, is the most direct and unambiguous way to terminate protein synthesis, guaranteeing a truncated and non-functional product. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
