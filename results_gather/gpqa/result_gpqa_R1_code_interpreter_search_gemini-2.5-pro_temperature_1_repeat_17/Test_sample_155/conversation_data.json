    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is a symmetric molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     H\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   For a trans-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene, a *syn*-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism with *anti*-addition, where the nucleophile (H₂O) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of one of the enantiomeric epoxides, for example, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Protonation of the epoxide oxygen makes it a good leaving group.\n        *   Water can attack either C4 or C5. Since the epoxide is symmetrical, both attacks are equally likely.\n        *   Attack at C4 inverts its stereocenter from R to S. The configuration at C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 inverts its stereocenter from R to S. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Now we must determine if (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are different compounds. A compound with two stereocenters and the configuration (R,S) or (S,R) is a *meso* compound if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. In this case, octane-4,5-diol is symmetric around the C4-C5 bond, so (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is an achiral meso compound.\n    *   The same meso compound is formed from the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also a symmetric molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-addition epoxidation.\n    *   For a cis-alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *syn*-addition results in a single, achiral *meso* epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane (also called cis-4,5-epoxyoctane). This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is the *anti*-addition ring-opening of the epoxide.\n    *   Starting with the meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol is achiral but is a diastereomer to the other two compounds, so it will also elute as a separate, single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
