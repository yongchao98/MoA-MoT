    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Original Decay\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V\n*   **Final State:** The final state consists of the 2B system, the two E particles, and the two V particles. If we consider the 2B system as a single recoiling entity, there are at least three \"bodies\" in the final state (2B, 2E, 2V).\n*   **Energy Spectrum:** In any decay with three or more particles in the final state, the total energy released (the Q-value) is shared among them. This sharing is not fixed; the energy of any one particle (or group of particles like the two E's) can vary continuously from zero up to a maximum value, as long as energy and momentum are conserved overall.\n*   **Conclusion 1:** The energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous, as stated in the problem. This is a fundamental consequence of a multi-body final state.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Variant Decay\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + M\n*   **Final State:** In this variant, the two V particles are replaced by a single exotic particle M. The final state consists of the 2B system, the two E particles, and the particle M. This is also a three-body final state.\n*   **Energy Spectrum:** Just like the original decay, because there are three bodies in the final state, the available energy will be shared among them in a continuous distribution.\n*   **Conclusion 2:** The total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles will remain **continuous**. The specific shape of the distribution will be different from the original decay because the phase space of the final state particles has changed (replacing two V particles with one M particle), but its nature as a continuum is preserved. This allows us to eliminate options C and D, which claim the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### 3. Compare the Endpoint Energies\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible total energy the two E particles can have. This occurs when the other light particles in the final state carry away the minimum possible energy.\n\n*   **Energy Released (Q-value):** The total energy released in a nuclear decay is the difference between the total mass-energy of the initial state and the total mass-energy of the final state particles.\n\n    *   **Q-value for Original Decay (Q_original):**\n        The energy released is converted into the kinetic energy of the products.\n        Q_original = (Mass_initial - Mass_final) * c²\n        Q_original = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V)) * c²\n        Here, m_X is the mass of particle X.\n\n    *   **Q-value for Variant Decay (Q_variant):**\n        The problem states M is a *massless* particle (m_M = 0).\n        Q_variant = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + m_M)) * c²\n        Q_variant = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E)) * c²\n\n*   **Comparing Q-values:**\n    Let's find the difference:\n    Q_variant - Q_original = [ (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c² ] - [ (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c² ]\n    Q_variant - Q_original = 2 * m_V * c²\n\n*   **Mass of Particle V:** The problem refers to V as a \"particle\". In physics, particles are generally assumed to have mass unless stated otherwise (like photons or gluons, or in this case, the explicitly massless M). The particle V, emitted in a process analogous to beta decay, can be assumed to have a positive rest mass (m_V > 0), just like a real-world neutrino. The fact that M is explicitly called massless while V is not reinforces this assumption.\n\n*   **Conclusion 3:** Since m_V > 0, the term 2 * m_V * c² is positive. Therefore, Q_variant > Q_original. The total energy released in the variant decay is greater than in the original decay. The endpoint of the E particle spectrum is directly dependent on this total available energy. A larger Q-value means a higher maximum possible energy for the E particles. Thus, the endpoint of the E spectrum **increases**.\n\n### Summary of Conclusions\n\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous** because the variant decay still has a three-body final state.\n2.  The endpoint of the spectrum **increases** because replacing two massive V particles with one massless M particle increases the total energy released in the decay.\n\nCombining these two points leads to the correct option.\n\n<<<B>>>"
