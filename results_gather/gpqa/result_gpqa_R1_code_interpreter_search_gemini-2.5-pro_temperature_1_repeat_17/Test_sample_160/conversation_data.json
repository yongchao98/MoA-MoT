    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Defining Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is related to the number density of target particles (`n`) and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\n\nλ ∝ 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWe have two scenarios to compare:\n*   **λ1**: The MFP of gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   **λ2**: The MFP of high-energy electrons from the TEM beam colliding with the same gas molecules.\n\nThe number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same in both cases. The temperature is also the same, but this primarily affects the speed of the gas molecules, which we will account for. The key differences lie in the collision dynamics and the cross-sectional area of the interaction.\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions)**\n\nIn a gas, all molecules are in constant, random motion. When calculating the collision frequency for a single molecule, we must consider the relative velocity with respect to other moving molecules. For a gas in thermal equilibrium (with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds), this introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator of the MFP formula.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule is:\n\nλ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule. In a simple hard-sphere model, if a molecule has a diameter `d`, the cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d` (the minimum distance between centers for a collision), so **σ_gg = πd²**.\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions)**\n\nIn this case, we have a beam of very high-energy electrons (1000 kV) traveling through the gas.\n*   **Target Motion:** The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light (~0.94c for 1000kV electrons). The residual gas molecules, with thermal velocities of a few hundred m/s, are essentially stationary by comparison. Therefore, the √2 factor for relative motion is not needed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** The electron is considered a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule). A collision occurs if this point particle passes within the radius (`r`) of the target molecule.\n\nThe formula for the mean free path of an electron in a gas is:\n\nλ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n*   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule. In the same hard-sphere model, a point-like electron collides with a molecule of radius `r = d/2`. The cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `r`, so **σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4**.\n\n### **4. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nNow, we substitute the cross-sections from our hard-sphere model:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (πd² / (πd²/4))\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * 4\n\nλ2 / λ1 = 4√2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, based on this standard model, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**.\n\n### **5. Considering Simpler Models and Conclusion**\n\nEven if we use a highly simplified model where we ignore the difference in geometric cross-section and assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg, the ratio would still be:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nIn either a standard or a simplified physical model, the mean free path of the electron (λ2) is significantly larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1). The ratio is at least √2.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, as our calculated ratios of ~1.414 and ~5.66 are both greater than 1.22)\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, as our calculated ratio is greater than 1.22)\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n\nThe physics robustly indicates that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least √2. The value 1.22 in the options is a threshold that is clearly surpassed. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
