    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Specifically, a peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O bond within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass. The fragment [COOH]⁺ has a mass of (12 for C) + (16 for O) + (16 for O) + (1 for H) = 45 amu. This is a very common and stable fragment produced by carboxylic acids upon ionization in a mass spectrometer.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined spectral data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two** oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options **A) C6H10O** and **D) C6H12O**, as they only have one oxygen.\n    *   We are left with **B) C6H10O2** and **C) C6H12O2**. To distinguish between them, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   Our molecule has one C=C bond (1 pi bond) and one C=O bond (1 pi bond). Therefore, it must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 is inconsistent with the presence of both a C=C and a C=O bond. This formula would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which would not show the alkene signals (FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and vinyl-hydrogens in NMR).\n*   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one C=C bond and one C=O bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only option that accounts for all the experimental evidence: the presence of a carboxylic acid (two oxygens, broad O-H, C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹, MS fragment at m/z 45) and an alkene (C=C at 1650 cm⁻¹, vinyl-hydrogens), which together require a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
