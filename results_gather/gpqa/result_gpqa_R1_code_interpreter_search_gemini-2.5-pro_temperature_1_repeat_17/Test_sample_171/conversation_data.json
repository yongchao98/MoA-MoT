    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in a higher energy state (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_i):\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in states j and i.\n    *   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   E_j, E_i are the energies of the states.\n    *   ΔE = E_j - E_i is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the gas.\n\n3.  **Define the \"excitation ratio\" for each star:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... compared to... star_2\". In astrophysics, this \"excitation\" refers to the ratio of the population in an excited state to the population in a lower state (usually the ground state). Let's call this ratio 'R'.\n    *   For star 1 (temperature T_1): R_1 = (N_excited / N_ground)_1\n    *   For star 2 (temperature T_2): R_2 = (N_excited / N_ground)_2\n\n    The problem states that R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:**\n    Let C = (g_excited / g_ground) be the ratio of statistical weights, which is a constant for the specific energy levels being considered.\n    *   For star 1: R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For star 2: R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n5.  **Set up the equation based on the problem statement:**\n    Substitute the expressions for R_1 and R_2 into the relationship R_1 = 2 * R_2:\n    C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n6.  **Solve the equation algebraically:**\n    *   The constant 'C' cancels from both sides:\n        exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to remove the exponentials:\n        ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n        ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n    *   Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n        (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    *   Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n        (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Use the given numerical values:**\n    The problem states that the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    The Boltzmann constant, k, is k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    The problem is designed such that the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n    (ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K.\n    The units of the calculation are [J] / [J/K] = [K]. The units in the derived equation are consistent: [K] * [K / K²] = [dimensionless], matching the dimensionless nature of ln(2).\n\n8.  **Substitute the value of ΔE/k into the equation:**\n    Replacing (ΔE / k) with 1, we get:\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived equation matches option A exactly.\n\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    C) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
