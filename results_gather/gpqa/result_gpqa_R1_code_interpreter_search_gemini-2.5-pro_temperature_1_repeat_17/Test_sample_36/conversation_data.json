    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify the final product E and determine the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH), with BF₃ as a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the protection of an aldehyde as a cyclic dithioacetal. The aldehyde's carbonyl group reacts with the two thiol groups of EDT to form a 1,3-dithiane ring.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. The carbon from the aldehyde carbonyl becomes C2 of the dithiane ring, and it carries the ethyl group from the original propionaldehyde.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane) and n-butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton on C2 (the carbon between the two sulfur atoms) is acidic because the sulfur atoms stabilize the resulting negative charge. This is a key step in \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal) chemistry.\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane carbanion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reactants:** Product B (the carbanion) and bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The carbanion at C2 is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic ethyl group of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane. A second ethyl group is now attached to the C2 position.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane) and reagents for deprotection (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction hydrolyzes the dithioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group. The two C-S bonds are cleaved and a C=O double bond is formed.\n*   **Product D:** The carbon that was C2 of the dithiane ring becomes the carbonyl carbon. Since it was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction. It involves two parts: formation of the ylide and reaction with the ketone.\n    1.  **Ylide formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon attached to the phosphorus, creating the Wittig ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    2.  **Wittig Reaction:** The ketone D (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃). The oxygen atom of the ketone and the PPh₃ group of the ylide are eliminated (forming Ph₃P=O), and a new carbon-carbon double bond is formed between the carbonyl carbon and the ylide carbon.\n*   **Product E:** The product is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂. The IUPAC name for this highly symmetric alkene is **3,4-diethyl-3-hexene**.\n\n**Step 6: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E (3,4-diethyl-3-hexene)**\n*   **Structure:**\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ rotational axis perpendicular to the C=C bond and passing through its center. This symmetry makes many of the carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n*   **Identifying Unique Carbons:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons:** The two carbons of the C=C double bond are equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** There are four ethyl groups, each containing one -CH₂- carbon. All four ethyl groups are attached to the equivalent carbons of the double bond, making them all chemically equivalent. Therefore, all four -CH₂- carbons are equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four -CH₃ carbons at the end of the four equivalent ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** In total, there are three distinct types of carbon environments in the molecule E. Therefore, the 13C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene will show **3 signals**.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
