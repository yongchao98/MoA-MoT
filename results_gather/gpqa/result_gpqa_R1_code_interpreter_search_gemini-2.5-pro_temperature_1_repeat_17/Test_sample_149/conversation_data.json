    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n        A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, likely a CH2 group. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The nitrogen atom in the molecular formula supports this.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it is coupled to one proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n        The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula. The DBE is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) = 5, which is also correct.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n        This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        Starting material: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride. The structure has a `[N≡N]+Cl-` group in place of the `NH2` group.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n        Adding water to the diazonium salt (usually with warming) causes hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        Intermediate: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n        Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n        This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with two acidic α-hydrogens (on the CH2 group). This is a classic setup for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl (HO-C6H4-). The starting aldehyde is R-CH2-CHO.\n            The aldol addition product is `R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO`, which is named **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n\n        *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction will likely not stop at the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxy aldehyde will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated product. The -OH group from C3 and the acidic H from C2 (alpha to the carbonyl) are eliminated.\n            `R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO` --(Heat, -H2O)--> `R-CH2-CH=C(R)-CHO`\n            The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product structure and match it with the options.**\n\n    *   The structure of the final condensation product is `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`.\n    *   Let's name this structure according to IUPAC rules:\n        - The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons with a C=C and a C=O).\n        - The aldehyde is C1, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. It is a **but-2-enal**.\n        - There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C2.\n        - There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C4.\n        - The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This name and structure perfectly match **Option A**.\n\n    *   **Why not D?** Option D, `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal`, is the aldol *addition* product. The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the subsequent dehydration to form the more thermodynamically stable conjugated system (the aldol *condensation* product). Therefore, A is the final product, not D.\n\n<<<A>>>"
