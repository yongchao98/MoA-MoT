    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base used to form an enolate from the ketone.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**, where a nucleophilic enolate adds to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   First, we must identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O), which are C-2 and C-6.\n    *   **At C-2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **At C-6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since C-6 is the only α-carbon with a proton, the base (t-BuOK) will selectively deprotonate C-6 to form the enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C-1 and C-6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at the C-6 position. It will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   For ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), the carbon adjacent to the C=O group is the α-carbon, and the next carbon is the β-carbon. So, the structure is CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   The nucleophilic C-6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon (CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate moiety. A subsequent protonation step (usually from the solvent or during workup) neutralizes the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting side chain attached to C-6 is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The final product is the original cyclohexanone ring with the -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt group attached at C-6. The full structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Now, we need to match this structure with the IUPAC names provided in the options. The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   Let's analyze the name from option D: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n        *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is a complex cyclohexyl group attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   Let's number the cyclohexyl ring substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate is C-1'.\n        *   The name indicates: a methyl group at C-1'; an oxo (C=O) group at C-2'; an ethyl group and a methyl group at C-3'.\n    *   Let's see if our predicted structure matches this name.\n        *   Our predicted attachment point is C-6 of the original ketone. So, C-1' in the name corresponds to C-6. Our C-6 has a methyl group, which matches the `1-methyl` part of the name.\n        *   If we number the ring from C-1' (our C-6) towards the original carbonyl group, the original C-1 becomes C-2'. This matches the `2-oxo` part of the name.\n        *   Continuing this numbering, the original C-2 becomes C-3'. Our C-2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, which matches the `3-ethyl` and `3-methyl` part of the name.\n    *   Thus, the structure we predicted matches the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon of the nitroalkane.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   The nucleophile is effectively `CH₃CH₂-C⁻H-NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   For but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), the β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The product after protonation (from H₂O) is: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂CN`.\n\n4.  **Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C-1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C-1.\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent alkane is hexane. With the nitrile group, it becomes a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We identify and number the substituents:\n        *   A methyl group at C-3.\n        *   A nitro group at C-4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   C) Both A and B are incorrect.\n*   D) Both A and B are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
