    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** This indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2. This is a type of cyclic ester known as a Î´-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   The carbon at position 4, which is bonded to the ethyl group and two different carbon atoms in the ring (C3 and C5), is a chiral center.\n*   The two reactions produce the two different enantiomers: (R) and (S).\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O  //\n     /  \\\n  O(1)--C(2)\n /        \\\nC(6)H2    C(3)H2\n \\        /\n  C(5)H2--C(4)H(Et)\n```\nThe stereochemistry (R or S) is determined by the configuration at the C4 chiral center.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, specifically a mono-isobutyl ester. The IUPAC name is given as \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's parse this name to confirm the structure:\n*   **Pentanoic acid:** The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 of a 5-carbon chain.\n*   **3-ethyl:** An ethyl group is at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo:** This describes the substituent at C5. It means C5 is a carbonyl carbon (`-oxo`) bonded to an isobutoxy group (`-OCH2CH(CH3)2`). This is an isobutyl ester.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-CH2CH(CH3)2`\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl-containing functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a chiral center at C3, which corresponds to the chiral center at C4 in the lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThe key to this problem is the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters. However, it reduces carboxylic acids very slowly or not at all under normal conditions. Therefore, in a molecule with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the **ester group** to a primary alcohol.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards esters. Therefore, in a molecule with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material A (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` --(LiBH4)--> `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (This is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    3.  The H+ workup protonates the intermediate and catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl at C1 to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction steps do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material B (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with BH3.\n    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` --(BH3)--> `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu` (This is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    3.  The H+ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl (-OH) group (from the reduced acid) attacks the ester carbonyl to form the six-membered lactone ring, releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the reaction steps do not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting material becomes C4 of the lactone product.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R) enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S) enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<A>>>"
