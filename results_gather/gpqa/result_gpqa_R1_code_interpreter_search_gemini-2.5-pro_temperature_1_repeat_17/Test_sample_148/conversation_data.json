    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the <sup>1</sup>H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Observation:** The two peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the sum of their integrals is 1H. This means there are two distinct species in the sample, each containing that proton, and they are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Observation:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out. This is a critical piece of information, confirming that the splitting is not due to neighboring protons.\n    *   **Inference:** The alpha-proton exists in two different chemical environments. This suggests the presence of two different, but very similar, molecules or conformers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Inference:** This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be separated based on their physical properties (in this case, their interaction with the chromatography column).\n    *   **Observation:** The two LC peaks have equal intensities, reinforcing the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass corresponds to the expected molecule.\n    *   **Inference:** This is a crucial finding. It means the two species are isomers â€“ they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight, but a different arrangement of atoms in space. This definitively rules out impurities like precursors or byproducts from side reactions that would alter the mass (like 'double coupling').\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** Because they are chemically different, diastereoisomers are expected to have distinct NMR spectra. A proton in one diastereomer is in a different chemical environment than the corresponding proton in the other, so two separate peaks would be observed. This fits the data.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard chromatography (LC). This would result in two separate LC peaks. They have the same molecular formula, so they would have the identical mass spectrum. This also fits the data perfectly.\n        *   A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is the slow rotation around the amide bond (C-N bond), especially preceding a proline residue. This creates stable *cis* and *trans* conformers (also called rotamers), which are diastereomeric to each other. This phenomenon perfectly explains seeing two sets of signals in NMR and two separable peaks in LC, both with the same mass.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight than the final product.\n        *   The MS data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the expected product. This option is inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give a single, identical spectrum. You would not see two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Similarly, on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This implies a side reaction where, for example, an extra amino acid was added.\n        *   This would create a new molecule with a higher molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data shows the mass of the *expected* molecule, not a larger one. This option is inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only explanation that is consistent with all the experimental evidence (two NMR peaks, two LC peaks, identical mass for both) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The specific phenomenon is likely due to the presence of stable rotamers (cis/trans conformers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<A>>>"
