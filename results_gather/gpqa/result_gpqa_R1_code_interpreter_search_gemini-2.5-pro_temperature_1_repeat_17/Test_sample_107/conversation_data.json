    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is also known as the Zeeman effect for the orbital part. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment operator.\n*   $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $e$ is the elementary charge.\n*   $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression, we get:\n\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so we can write $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product becomes:\n\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = (L_x\\hat{i} + L_y\\hat{j} + L_z\\hat{k}) \\cdot (B\\hat{k}) = L_z B$\n\nThe expectation value of the energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, is then:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{e}{2m_e} L_z B \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e B}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle$\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the angular momentum, $\\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle$, is quantized and given by $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e B}{2m_e} m\\hbar = \\left(\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\right) m B$\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n\n$\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n\nSo, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\n### **2. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy**\n\nWe are given:\n*   A \"small value\" for $m$. Let's use $m=1$ for our order-of-magnitude calculation.\n*   $B = 1$ T.\n*   $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}$ J/T.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\nThe order of magnitude for the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately $10^{-23}$ J.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Transition Energy**\n\nThe transition energy, $\\Delta E$, corresponds to a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The energy of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n*   $h$ (Planck's constant) $\\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s.\n*   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 3.00 \\times 10^{8}$ m/s.\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nThe order of magnitude for the transition energy is approximately $10^{-19}$ J.\n\n### **4. Comparing the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 10^{-23}$ J\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 10^{-19}$ J\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the transition energy.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the calculation, we can confidently state that:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis is a general result in atomic physics: the energy shifts due to external magnetic fields (Zeeman effect) are typically very small compared to the energy differences between principal electronic levels.\n\nWe can verify this with a simple Python script.\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Constants\nmu_B = const.value('Bohr magneton') # J/T\nh = const.h # J·s\nc = const.c # m/s\n\n# Given values\nm = 1 # small orbital magnetic quantum number\nB = 1 # T\nwavelength = 0.4861e-6 # m\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H>\nH_coupling = m * mu_B * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy Delta_E\nDelta_E = (h * c) / wavelength\n\n# 3. Compare the two values\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H>: {H_coupling:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E: {Delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta_E: {H_coupling / Delta_E:.4e}\")\n\n# Determine the relationship\nif H_coupling / Delta_E < 0.01:\n    print(\"Conclusion: <H> << Delta E\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Relationship is different.\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H>: 9.2740e-24 J\nTransition energy Delta E: 4.0874e-19 J\nRatio <H> / Delta_E: 2.2690e-05\nConclusion: <H> << Delta E\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms our manual calculation and conclusion. The paramagnetic coupling energy is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**:\n    The energy of interaction of an atomic orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field (paramagnetic coupling or Zeeman effect) is given by:\n    $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states to use a \"small value,\" so we can take $m=1$ as a representative case.\n    *   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant with a value of approximately $9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$.\n    *   $B$ is the strength of the magnetic field, given as $1 \\text{ T}$.\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\cdot (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\cdot (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the transition energy ($\\Delta E$)**:\n    The energy of a photon corresponding to an atomic transition is related to its wavelength by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n    $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n    where:\n    *   $h$ is Planck's constant, approximately $6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light, approximately $3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$.\n    *   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, given as $0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$. (Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series transition from n=4 to n=2 in Hydrogen, known as the H-beta line).\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n3.  **Compare the two energies**:\n    Now we compare the orders of magnitude of the two calculated energies:\n    *   $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J} \\sim 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n    *   $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} \\sim 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n    The transition energy ($\\sim 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$) is about four to five orders of magnitude larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\sim 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$).\n\n    To be precise, the ratio is:\n    $\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\n    Since this ratio is extremely small, we can conclude that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much, much smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTherefore, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
