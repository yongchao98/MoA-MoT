    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and A, generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   **Observer:** The potentials are measured at a position `r` and time `t`.\n*   **Retardation:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field measured at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, `tr`, called the retarded time. The charge was at position `s(tr)` at that instant.\n*   **Retarded Time Condition:** The time delay is the light travel time from the source's position at `tr` to the observer's position `r`. This is given by the implicit equation:\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n### 2. Key Definitions from the Problem Statement\n\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   `s(t)`: the trajectory of the charge.\n*   `r`: the field observation point.\n*   `tr`: the retarded time (the time the field was generated).\n*   `s(tr)`: the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`: the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n### 3. Derivation of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a time-varying charge and current distribution (`ρ` and `J`) are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nwhere the quantities in the square brackets `[]` are evaluated at the retarded time `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ q δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ q v(tr) δ³(r' - s(tr)) / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nThe evaluation of these integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `tr` depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration (a standard result in electrodynamics) introduces a correction factor to account for the motion of the source during the emission of the signal. The result of the integration is:\n\n`∫ f(r') δ³(r' - s(tr)) d³r' = [ f(r') / (1 - (v ⋅ (r - r')) / (c |r - r'|)) ]_ret`\n\nwhere the `_ret` subscript means all quantities (`r'`, `v`) are evaluated at the position `s(tr)` and retarded time `tr`.\n\nApplying this result to our potential integrals:\n*   For `V`, the function `f(r')` is `q / |r - r'|`.\n*   For `A`, the function `f(r')` is `μ₀ q v(tr) / |r - r'|`.\n\nLet's evaluate the potentials using the notation from the problem: `d = r - s(tr)`, `d = |d|`, and `v = v(tr)`.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [ (q / |r - r'|) / (1 - (v ⋅ (r - r')) / (c |r - r'|)) ]_ret`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / d) / (1 - (v ⋅ d) / (c d))`\nSimplifying the denominator:\n`1 - (v ⋅ d) / (c d) = (cd - v ⋅ d) / (cd)`\nSo,\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / d) / ((cd - v ⋅ d) / (cd))`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (qcd) / (d (cd - v ⋅ d))`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - d ⋅ v))` (Note: `v ⋅ d` is the same as `d ⋅ v`)\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [ (q v(tr) / |r - r'|) / (1 - (v ⋅ (r - r')) / (c |r - r'|)) ]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v / d) / (1 - (v ⋅ d) / (cd))`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v / d) / ((cd - v ⋅ d) / (cd))`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v cd) / (d (cd - v ⋅ d))`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   **Derived V:** `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n*   **Derived A:** `A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNow checking the options:\n\n*   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v)),  A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))**\n    This matches our derived expressions exactly. Note that `dc` is the same as `cd`. The problem statement uses `μ_o` for permeability, which is the same as `μ₀`.\n\n*   **B) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**\n    Incorrect. This uses the static potential form for V and an incorrect relation for A.\n\n*   **C) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v)),  A(r,t) = (μ qc v) / (4π (dc + d ⋅ v))**\n    Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The `d ⋅ v` term should be subtracted, not added.\n\n*   **D) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**\n    Incorrect. This uses the static potential form for V. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials (where `v` is the retarded velocity and V is the Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential), the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
