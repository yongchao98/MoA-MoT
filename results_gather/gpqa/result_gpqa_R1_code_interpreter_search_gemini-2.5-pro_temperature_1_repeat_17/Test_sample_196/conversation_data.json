  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm-1 (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring is strongly indicated.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this region is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (Signals from 0.9 to 2.9 ppm):**\n            *   Let's assemble the alkyl chain attached to the benzene ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a -CH3 group adjacent to a -CH2 group (CH3-CH2-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a -CH3 group adjacent to a -CH group (CH3-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH2- group, which is adjacent to both the -CH3 (at 0.9 ppm) and the -CH (at 2.9 ppm).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the -CH- group. Its downfield shift indicates it is the benzylic proton (the one directly attached to the aromatic ring). It is adjacent to the -CH3 (at 1.4 ppm) and the -CH2- (at 1.7 ppm).\n            *   **Putting it together:** The alkyl substituent is a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option D, which is the starting material.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain are not affected by these reagents.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        The -COOH group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a -CH3 group.\n        `4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid`  ---(Red P, HI)--> `1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene`\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is reduced.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This matches the predicted product of the reduction.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, not the final product.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
