    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 2:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n*   **Signal 3:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 4:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n\nLet's interpret each signal to build the structure piece by piece.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for an acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This suggests a `CH₃-CH-` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is common for a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond (a vinylic methyl group).\n\n*   **Signal 3 & 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) and 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** These signals each represent a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5-7 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a C=C double bond (vinylic protons). The presence of two such signals indicates a disubstituted double bond of the type `-CH=CH-`.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This vinylic proton is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). The key piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This vinylic proton is a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The **doublet** part arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n        *   The **quartet** part arises from coupling to three adjacent protons, which must be the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n\n### **2. Assemble the Pieces**\n\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   We have an acetyl group: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-`\n*   We have a `-CH=CH-` group.\n*   We have a `CH₃-` group attached to the double bond.\n\nPutting these together gives the structure of **propenyl acetate**: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n### **3. Rule out Butenyl Acetate**\n\nLet's check the total number of protons.\n*   The NMR data shows a total integration of 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = **8 protons**.\n*   The molecular formula for propenyl acetate is C₅H₈O₂ (8 protons). This matches.\n*   The molecular formula for butenyl acetate is C₆H₁₀O₂ (10 protons). This does not match.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**.\n\n### **4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The deciding factor is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   **Rule of thumb for vinylic coupling:**\n    *   *trans*-coupling (protons on opposite sides of the C=C bond) has a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   *cis*-coupling (protons on the same side of the C=C bond) has a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed J-value is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the *trans* range. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data corresponds to a propenyl acetate with a trans double bond. The unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's verify the full assignment for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(c)   H(b)\n       \\    /\n        C = C\n       /    \\\nCH₃(d)-C      O-C(=O)-CH₃(a)\n```\n*   **H(a) at 2.1 ppm (s):** Acetyl methyl. Correct.\n*   **H(b) at 7.0 ppm (d):** Vinylic proton next to the deshielding oxygen atom. Coupled to H(c) with a large trans-coupling constant (J=16.0 Hz). Correct.\n*   **H(c) at 5.5 ppm (dq):** Vinylic proton coupled to H(b) (doublet) and the three H(d) protons (quartet). Correct.\n*   **H(d) at 1.6 ppm (d):** Methyl group on the double bond, coupled to the single proton H(c). Correct.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
