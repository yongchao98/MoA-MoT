You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "The user wants to identify the reason for the failed overexpression of a recombinant protein.\n\n1.  **Understand the experiment:** The goal is to express a mouse GADD45G protein with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The construct was made, transfected into CHO cells, but the protein expression failed.\n\n2.  **Analyze the provided sequence:** The sequence is a DNA coding sequence (CDS), starting with 5' and ending with 3'. It is the \"plus strand,\" which is the sense strand and has a sequence similar to the resulting mRNA (with T instead of U). Translation will start from the first ATG codon.\n    *   The sequence is: `5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'`\n\n3.  **Hypothesize potential problems based on the multiple-choice options:**\n    *   A) Lack of a linker: This is a protein design consideration. While sometimes useful, its absence doesn't typically cause a complete failure of expression unless it leads to extreme misfolding and degradation. It's less likely to be the primary, \"annoying\" reason compared to a sequence error.\n    *   B) Early termination of translation: This would be caused by a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) within the reading frame. This is a very common and definitive reason for expression failure.\n    *   C) Missense mutation in the tag: A missense mutation changes one amino acid to another. This would result in a full-length protein, albeit with one incorrect amino acid. It would not typically prevent overexpression, although it might affect antibody recognition if the mutation is in the epitope. The problem states an inability to overexpress the protein, suggesting no or very little protein is made.\n    *   D) No tRNA for UAA in mouse: This is biologically incorrect. UAA is a standard stop codon, and its recognition by release factors (not tRNA) is a universal mechanism in eukaryotes. Also, the experiment is being done in Chinese hamster ovary cells, not a mouse.\n\n4.  **Test the most likely hypothesis (B):** I will translate the DNA sequence into a protein sequence to see if a premature stop codon exists. The reading frame starts with the first `ATG`. I will read the sequence in triplets (codons).\n\n    *   Codon 1: `ATG` -> Methionine (M, Start)\n    *   Codon 2: `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   Codon 3: `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   Codon 4: `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   Codon 5: `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   Codon 6: `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   Codon 7: `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   Codon 8: `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   Codon 9: `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   Codon 10: `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n        *   (The sequence YPYDVPDYA is the HA tag. So far, so good, except for the initial Methionine and the next codon.)\n    *   Codon 11: `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   Codon 12: `TGA` -> **STOP**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The codon `TGA` is a stop codon. It appears at nucleotide position 34, immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and one additional amino acid. This will cause the ribosome to detach from the mRNA and terminate protein synthesis, resulting in a tiny, non-functional peptide (11 amino acids long) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This perfectly explains the inability to detect the overexpressed protein. Therefore, the ribosome terminated the translation early.\n\nThe python code I used for this reasoning has already been executed and the output confirms the manual translation. The code found a stop codon at base pair 34, leading to a truncated protein.\n\n<<<B>>>"
