    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound\n\n*   The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents.\n*   We need to identify the principal functional group to determine the parent name. The priority order for the given functional groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid (-COOH) > Aldehyde (-CHO, carbaldehyde) > Nitrile (-CN, cyano) > Ketone > Alcohol (-OH, hydroxyl) > Amine (-N(CH3)2, dimethylamino) > Ether (-OCH3, methoxy).\n*   The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from the Description\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given relative positions.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (by definition).\n*   **Para to COOH:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to COOH:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n*   **Remaining positions:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl prefix) and a cyano group (-CN) are on the remaining positions, C3 and C5. The description says they are meta to one another, which is consistent with the C3 and C5 positions.\n*   **Nitrile relationships (key to solving ambiguity):**\n    1.  The methoxy group at C4 is ortho to the nitrile (-CN). The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent.\n    2.  The alcohol (-OH) is also ortho to the nitrile (-CN). This is the crucial piece of information to fix the positions of the ortho and meta groups.\n        *   **Case 1:** Let's assume the -OH group is at C2. The positions ortho to C2 are C1 and C3. Since C1 has the -COOH group, the -CN group must be at **C3**.\n        *   **Case 2:** Let's assume the -OH group is at C6. The positions ortho to C6 are C1 and C5. So the -CN group must be at **C5**.\n\n    Let's follow Case 1, which places -OH at C2 and -CN at C3.\n    *   If -OH is at C2, then the other ortho group, -N(CH3)2, must be at **C6**.\n    *   If -CN is at C3, then the other meta group, -CHO, must be at **C5**.\n\n    Let's verify this structure:\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -OH\n    *   **C3:** -CN\n    *   **C4:** -OCH3\n    *   **C5:** -CHO\n    *   **C6:** -N(CH3)2\n\n    This structure satisfies all the conditions given in the problem. The numbering (1 -> 2 -> 3...) is clockwise.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\n*   The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locant set to the substituents.\n*   Let's check both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering from C1:\n    *   **Clockwise:** Substituents are at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise:** Substituents are also at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since the locant sets are identical, we use the alphabetical order of the substituent names to break the tie. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that appears first in the alphabet.\n*   The substituent prefixes are:\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n    *   In the clockwise numbering scheme (derived above), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the counter-clockwise scheme, the -N(CH3)2 group would be at C2, -CHO at C3, -OCH3 at C4, -CN at **C5**, and -OH at C6.\n*   Comparing the locants for \"cyano\": 3 (clockwise) vs. 5 (counter-clockwise). Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering is correct**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nNow we assemble the full IUPAC name using the correct (clockwise) numbering and alphabetical order of substituents.\n\n1.  **Numbering and Substituents:**\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   6-dimethylamino\n2.  **Alphabetize:**\n    *   3-**c**yano\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)  *(Note: The 'di' counts for alphabetization in this case)*\n    *   5-**f**ormyl\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy\n3.  **Combine with Parent Name:**\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n### 5. Match with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived name with the given options:\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Correct numbering, but substituents are not listed alphabetically.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetization.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
