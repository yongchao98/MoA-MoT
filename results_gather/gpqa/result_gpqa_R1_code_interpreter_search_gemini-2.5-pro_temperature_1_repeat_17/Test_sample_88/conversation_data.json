    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the types of compounds involved.**\n    *   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1.** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. The product (P1) has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a signal for 2H at 4.79 ppm, which is in the region for vinylic protons (C=C-H). The presence of both a ketone and a double bond in a C10H14O molecule (the formula deduced from the starting material) suggests that P1 is an unsaturated ketone. The IR value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a non-conjugated ketone (e.g., in a 6-membered ring), implying the C=C and C=O groups are not conjugated. Therefore, **Product 1 is a β,γ-unsaturated ketone.** The ¹H NMR shows a single signal for two protons at 4.79 ppm, which indicates that the two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry in the molecule. This implies a fragment like `-CH=CH-` where the molecule has a plane or axis of symmetry.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2.** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-i-Pr)₃). This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The C=C double bond is unaffected. Therefore, **Product 2 is a β,γ-unsaturated alcohol.** It has the same carbon skeleton as P1 and retains the C=C double bond.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3.** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves C=C double bonds and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups (ketones or aldehydes). Since the double bond in P2 was of the symmetric `-CH=CH-` type, ozonolysis will cleave it to form two aldehyde (`-CHO`) groups. Therefore, **Product 3 is a dialdehyde** (and also contains the alcohol group from P2).\n\n2.  **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen in Product 3 and its coupling pattern.**\n    *   Product 3 is a dialdehyde that also contains an alcohol group. The most deshielded protons in such a molecule (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) are the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically have a chemical shift (δ) in the range of 9-10 ppm.\n    *   The question asks for the coupling pattern of this most deshielded hydrogen atom. The coupling pattern of a proton is determined by the number of adjacent protons (protons on the neighboring carbon atom), following the n+1 rule.\n    *   The aldehyde group in P3, `-CHO`, was formed from a vinylic `-CH=` group in P2. The carbon adjacent to the aldehyde group in P3 was the allylic carbon in P2 (i.e., the carbon adjacent to the double bond).\n    *   Let's represent the fragment in P2 as `C(allylic)-CH(vinylic)=CH(vinylic)-C'(allylic)`. Due to the symmetry of P1 and P2, the two allylic carbons, C and C', must be equivalent.\n    *   The key question is: are these allylic carbons `CH` groups or `CH2` groups? This will determine the structure around the aldehyde in P3.\n        *   **Scenario A:** If the allylic carbon is a methine (`CH`) group, the fragment in P3 would be `...-CH-CHO`. The aldehyde proton would be coupled to the single proton on the adjacent carbon. By the n+1 rule (n=1), its signal would be a **doublet**. This might be further split by long-range coupling (e.g., to a doublet of triplets), but the primary splitting would be a doublet.\n        *   **Scenario B:** If the allylic carbon is a methylene (`CH2`) group, the fragment in P3 would be `...-CH2-CHO`. The aldehyde proton would be coupled to the two equivalent protons on the adjacent carbon. By the n+1 rule (n=2), its signal would be a **triplet**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis.**\n    *   The options are pentet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, and triplet.\n    *   A simple doublet is not an option.\n    *   This leaves us to decide between the more complex patterns and the simple triplet. Both a doublet of triplets (Scenario A with long-range coupling) and a triplet (Scenario B) are plausible coupling patterns for an aldehyde.\n    *   Although the exact structure of the intermediates is complex and difficult to determine from the given information (and contains inconsistencies), we can deduce the outcome. The formation of a structure where the allylic position is a `CH2` group is a valid possibility during the rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton. In such a case, the resulting aldehyde proton in the final product would be adjacent to this `CH2` group.\n    *   The coupling of the aldehyde proton to the two protons of the adjacent `CH2` group results in a signal that is a triplet (n=2, so 2+1=3 peaks). This is the most straightforward interpretation that matches one of the given options.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a triplet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
