    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the compound class but does not distinguish between the specific isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the n+1 rule. A complex splitting pattern like 'dtq' means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This proton must be coupled to:\n    *   1 adjacent proton (d, from 1+1=2)\n    *   2 adjacent protons (t, from 2+1=3)\n    *   3 adjacent protons (q, from 3+1=4)\n    Therefore, we are looking for a proton with neighbors of (1H, 2H, and 3H).\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This proton must be coupled to:\n    *   1 adjacent proton (d, from 1+1=2)\n    *   2 adjacent protons (t, from 2+1=3)\n    *   Another, different set of 2 adjacent protons (t, from 2+1=3)\n    Therefore, we are looking for a proton with neighbors of (1H, 2H, and 2H).\n\nThe correct structure must have **both** of these proton environments.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's systematically name and analyze the protons in each option.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH(b)(CH₃(g))-COOH(a)`\n*   **Proton Hc (at C3):** Neighbors are Hd (2H), Hb (1H), and Hf (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n*   **Does it have a dtt?** We need a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H). No proton in this molecule fits this description.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-CH(c)(C₂H₅(f,g))-CH(b)(C₂H₅(h,i))-COOH(a)`\n*   **Proton Hc (at C3):** Neighbors are Hb (1H), Hd (2H), and Hf (2H, from the ethyl group). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This matches the requirement for a **dtt**.\n*   **Does it have a dtq?** We need a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H). No proton in this molecule fits this description.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(e)-CH(d)(CH₃(f))-CH(c)(CH₃(g))-CH₂(b)-COOH(a)`\n*   **Proton Hc (at C3):** Neighbors are Hd (1H), Hb (2H), and Hg (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n*   **Does it have a dtt?** We need a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H). No proton in this molecule fits this description.\n*   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThe condensed formula is ambiguous, but it is the only remaining option. Let's assume it represents 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which has the same molecular formula (C₉H₁₈O₂).\nStructure: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(C₂H₅(c,d))-CH(e)(C₂H₅(f,g))-CH₂(h)-COOH(i)`\n*   **Proton Hb (at C4):** Its neighbors are Ha (3H), He (1H), and Hc (2H, from the ethyl group). The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 3H)**. This matches the requirement for a **dtq**.\n*   **Proton He (at C3):** Its neighbors are Hb (1H), Hh (2H), and Hf (2H, from the ethyl group). The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 2H)**. This matches the requirement for a **dtt**.\n\n**Conclusion:** This structure contains a proton (Hb) that would produce a dtq signal and a different proton (He) that would produce a dtt signal. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nThe only compound that has proton environments corresponding to both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which is represented by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
