    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram.\n\n### Method 1: Analyzing the Loop Factor\n\n1.  **Identify the Loop Factor:** In Quantum Field Theory (QFT) calculations, particularly those involving loop diagrams in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integration typically introduces a characteristic factor. This factor arises from the integration measure `d^4k / (2π)^4` over the loop momentum `k`. After performing the integration over the angular components in Euclidean space, this leads to a standard factor of `1 / (16π^2)` for each loop.\n\n2.  **Rewrite the Standard Factor:** The factor `1 / (16π^2)` can be expressed as `1 / (4π)^2`. So, for an `L`-loop diagram, we expect to see a factor of `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Expression:** The expression provided is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n    We can identify the term `1/(4pi)^6` as the loop factor.\n\n4.  **Equate and Solve for L:** By comparing the general form of the loop factor with the one in the expression, we can set up an equation for the number of loops, `L`:\n    `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^6`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n    By comparing the exponents in the denominator, we get:\n    `2L = 6`\n    Solving for `L`, we find:\n    `L = 3`\n\nThis method suggests that the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n### Method 2: Dimensional Analysis (Consistency Check)\n\nThis method provides an independent way to verify the result.\n\n1.  **Identify Couplings and Vertices (V):** The terms `alpha` and `g` are coupling constants. In a renormalizable four-dimensional QFT, these are typically dimensionless. The expression contains `alpha^3 * g^2`, which means there are a total of `3 + 2 = 5` vertices in the diagram. So, `V = 5`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Mass Dimension of the Amplitude:** The factor `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of two energy scales squared. This factor is dimensionless. For the entire expression to be a dimensionless \"size estimate\", the part of the expression coming from the loop integral calculation must have a mass dimension that is canceled by `(Q/M)^2`. Since `(Q/M)^2` has a mass dimension of `[Mass]^2`, the loop integral result must have a mass dimension of `[Mass]^(-2)`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Power-Counting Formula:** The mass dimension of a Feynman amplitude `A` in four-dimensional spacetime is given by the formula:\n    `Dimension(A) = 4 - E`\n    where `E` is the number of external legs.\n    Alternatively, we can use a formula that relates the dimension to the number of loops (`L`) and vertices (`V`), assuming dimensionless couplings:\n    `Dimension(A) = 2L - 2V + 2`\n    *(This formula is derived from the general power-counting theorem `Dimension(A) = 4L - 2I`, where `I` is the number of internal lines, combined with the topological relation `L = I - V + 1`)*.\n\n4.  **Solve for L:** We know the dimension must be -2, and we found that `V = 5`. We can plug these values into the formula:\n    `-2 = 2L - 2(5) + 2`\n    `-2 = 2L - 10 + 2`\n    `-2 = 2L - 8`\n    `6 = 2L`\n    `L = 3`\n\nBoth methods independently and consistently lead to the conclusion that the diagram must have had 3 loops. The other factors in the expression (`sqrt(2)`, `8`) are numerical constants arising from symmetries or specific algebraic manipulations and do not affect the loop count.\n\n<<<D>>>"
