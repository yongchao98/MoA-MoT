This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The clue that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly points to the most common cycloalkane solvent, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent across all provided analyses.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    *   For this second component to not decolorize bromine water but still be related to cyclohexane, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound, **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This conclusion is also unanimous among the candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer.**\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n        `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n4.  **Match the Answer to the Options.**\n    *   The calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 16\n        B) 12\n        C) 22\n        D) 18\n    *   The calculated answer, 18, corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided methods.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Clue:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** A mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Clue:** Z does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Clue:** Z is a widely used solvent, and hydrogenation of all other substances in the problem leads to Z.\n*   **Conclusion:** These clues strongly point to Z being the most common and stable C₆ cycloalkane solvent, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This also implies that all other compounds in the problem have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** Since the components do not decolorize bromine water, they must be saturated or aromatic. We know one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and must not react with bromine water. The only substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Clue:** Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** In catalytic reactions of cyclic hydrocarbons, disproportionation often involves a hydrogen transfer, producing the fully saturated compound (cyclohexane) and the fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound (benzene). This is consistent with our identification.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y. We can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A from X + Liquid B from X → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Principle:** The Law of Conservation of Atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms, this must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n**4. Matching with Options**\n\nThe calculated numerical answer is 18. The options provided are:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Consensus:** I will first review all 15 candidate answers to find the common logical thread and the final numerical result they arrive at.\n    *   **Step 1 (Identify Z):** All agents correctly identify substance Z as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). They use the hydrogen mass fraction (14.28% ≈ 1/7) to find the formula CₙH₂ₙ and combine this with the facts that it's saturated and a common solvent. This conclusion is unanimous and sound.\n    *   **Step 2 (Identify Y):** All agents correctly identify mixture Y as an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). This is based on the facts that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, its hydrogenation gives only cyclohexane, and it's formed by a disproportionation reaction (a hydrogen transfer). This conclusion is also unanimous and sound.\n    *   **Step 3 (Calculate the Answer):** All agents correctly apply the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction `Mixture X → Mixture Y`. They conclude that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   **Calculation:** Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   **Numerical Conclusion:** Every single agent correctly calculates the numerical answer to be **18**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Discrepancy:** The agents provide different final letter choices (A, B, C, D) despite all calculating the same number (18). This indicates that the errors are not in the chemical reasoning but in mapping the number 18 to the correct option letter. Some agents appear to be working with a scrambled or different list of options.\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Answer:** I will perform the final, correct mapping based on the options provided in the original question.\n    *   **Question's Options:** A) 16, B) 12, C) 18, D) 22\n    *   **Calculated Numerical Answer:** 18\n    *   **Correct Mapping:** The number 18 corresponds to option **C**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that formalizes this logic. The script will:\n    *   Define the number of hydrogen atoms in the components of mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n    *   Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms based on the principle of atom conservation.\n    *   Define the options as provided in the question.\n    *   Programmatically find and print the correct option letter corresponding to the calculated result.\n\nThis ensures a clear, verifiable, and correct path to the final answer, resolving the confusion seen in the candidate responses.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following the logical steps\n    agreed upon by all candidate answers and then correctly mapping the result\n    to the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the components of Mixture Y.\n    # Based on the unanimous analysis from all agents, Mixture Y is an equimolar\n    # mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n    # Cyclohexane (C6H12) is substance Z.\n    # Benzene (C6H6) is the other component.\n    h_atoms_in_cyclohexane = 12\n    h_atoms_in_benzene = 6\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the law of conservation of atoms.\n    # The reaction is: Mixture X -> Mixture Y.\n    # This is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n    # The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X\n    # must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    total_hydrogen_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_in_cyclohexane + h_atoms_in_benzene\n\n    # Step 3: State the options and find the correct choice.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 16,\n        \"B\": 12,\n        \"C\": 18,\n        \"D\": 22\n    }\n\n    final_choice = None\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        if value == total_hydrogen_atoms_in_X:\n            final_choice = choice\n            break\n\n    # Step 4: Print the detailed reasoning and the final answer.\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation of the answer:\")\n    print(\"1.

Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated and a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The fact that it is a widely used solvent strongly suggests it is the most common and stable example, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a critical clue. It means that all compounds in both mixtures must have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components must be saturated or aromatic. We know one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton, not react with bromine water, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   The formation via disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer) also supports this, as a more hydrogenated species (cyclohexane) and a less hydrogenated species (benzene) are the logical products.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer**\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** Let the two components of mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\n    `A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Analysis (Conservation of Atoms):** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:** We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently shows that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of atoms in the established chemical reaction. This conclusion is further supported by identifying the likely components of X as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), whose hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nMatching the result with the given options:\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This also implies that all other compounds in the problem have a six-carbon ring skeleton, as they all hydrogenate to Z.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, not decolorize bromine water, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y by disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer) also supports this, as a fully hydrogenated species (cyclohexane) and a fully dehydrogenated species (benzene) are the logical products.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the Law of Conservation of Atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification**\n*   To ensure this is chemically sound, we can identify the components of mixture X. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds (to decolorize bromine water) and must not have conjugated bonds. The pair that fits these criteria and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result derived from the conservation of atoms.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting this fraction to 1/7 (`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`) and solving for y gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem also states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent and chemically sound.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated, gives only Z. This means the second component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only substance that fits all these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic (unreactive with bromine water) and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction, considering the equimolar nature of the mixtures, can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   According to the Law of Conservation of Atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (cyclohexane + benzene).\n*   Calculation: Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must be 18.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 18\nB) 16\nC) 22\nD) 12\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to determine the chemical identity of substance Z.\n*   **Composition**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation**: For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)` using approximate atomic masses. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation**: The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates that it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identity**: Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and stable cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification fits all the given criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Composition**: We know that Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components. The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n*   **Reaction Clue**: Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In the context of cyclic hydrocarbons, this is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction, which typically produces the fully saturated cycloalkane and the fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: Based on the above, the other component of Y must be the aromatic equivalent of cyclohexane, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. A mixture of cyclohexane and benzene fits all the criteria: it's an equimolar mixture of two liquids, neither component decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenation of the mixture (which converts benzene to cyclohexane) yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer\nThe final step is to use the law of conservation of atoms to find the answer.\n*   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid 1 from X + Liquid 2 from X → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms**: The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane = 12\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of benzene = 6\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Step 4: Match with Options\nThe calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 22\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   We are told Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clues that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and that all other substances in the problem are related to it through hydrogenation strongly suggest that Z is the most common and stable C₆ cycloalkane, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is substance Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated, yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only substance that fits all these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to form cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted into mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. This type of reaction involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms.\n*   The overall reaction can be written as:\n    `Mixture X (Liquid 1 + Liquid 2) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry for the components is 1:1.\n    `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   The fundamental principle of the Law of Conservation of Atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

It is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen) and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7 implies the formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Since Z is saturated, it must be a cycloalkane. The fact that it is a common solvent and the central compound in the reaction scheme strongly points to **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent and logically sound.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nAll candidate answers are in agreement on the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:** The second component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and must not react with bromine water. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThis is the crucial step where the final answer is derived. All candidate answers use the same principle.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **The Reaction:** We can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid 1 from X + Liquid 2 from X → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Analysis (Conservation of Atoms):** The law of conservation of atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation**: The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates that it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identity**: Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and stable cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification fits all the given criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Composition**: We know that Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components. The problem also states that hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only Z. This implies that the second component of Y must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton and be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   **Deduction**: Since the second component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only common substance that fits these criteria is an aromatic compound with a C₆ skeleton, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and its hydrogenation produces cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer\nThe final step is to analyze the chemical reaction that converts mixture X into mixture Y.\n*   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer. Since both mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms**: The fundamental principle of chemical reactions is the conservation of atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation**: We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of each component of mixture Y):\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Final Answer**: By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Verification\nThis conclusion is supported by identifying plausible components for mixture X. The components must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds. The pair that fits all criteria is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result obtained from analyzing the reaction.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to determine the chemical identity of substance Z.\n*   **Composition:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(y * atomic mass of H) / (x * atomic mass of C + y * atomic mass of H)`. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this becomes `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identity:** Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and stable cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the given information.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Composition:** We know that Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components. The problem also states that hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only Z. This implies that the other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction Clue:** Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In the context of cyclic hydrocarbons, this is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction, which typically produces the fully saturated (hydrogen-rich) compound and the fully unsaturated (hydrogen-poor) aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** The other component of Y must be the aromatic equivalent of cyclohexane, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic (and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions) and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Answer\nThe final step is to use the law of conservation of atoms to find the answer.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y. The reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Component A of X + Component B of X → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n### Careful Points and Verification\n*   The deduction that Z is cyclohexane is robust, based on its formula, saturation, and use as a solvent.\n*   The identification of Y as cyclohexane and benzene is strongly supported by the disproportionation reaction mechanism and the chemical properties described.\n*   The core of the solution lies in the principle of atom conservation, which is a fundamental law. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) must equal the total in the products (mixture Y).\n*   We can verify this is a chemically sound scenario by identifying the components of X. They must be unsaturated C₆ rings without conjugated bonds, and their hydrogens must sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits perfectly (10 + 8 = 18).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation**: For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass)`, which can be approximated as `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation and Identity**: The problem states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. Given that Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical and common compound fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point**: A critical piece of information is that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z. This strongly implies that all compounds involved in the problem share the same six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y\nThe next step is to determine the components of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Components**: We know one component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton and, upon hydrogenation, yield cyclohexane. Since it does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only compound that fits these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The formation of Y via a disproportionation reaction supports this conclusion. In catalytic reactions of cyclic hydrocarbons, disproportionation often involves a hydrogen transfer, resulting in the formation of the fully saturated compound (cyclohexane) and the fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation\nThe final step is to use the law of conservation of atoms to find the answer.\n*   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be represented for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation**: We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Answer**: Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Verification\nThis result can be verified by identifying plausible components for mixture X. They must be unsaturated C₆ rings without conjugated bonds, and their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all conditions perfectly (10 + 8 = 18, both are non-conjugated unsaturated C₆ rings).\n\nThe calculated numerical answer is 18.

This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of Z be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The clue that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" strongly points to the most common cycloalkane solvent, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent across all provided analyses.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n    *   The other component must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton, as hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    *   For this second component to not decolorize bromine water but still be related to cyclohexane, it must be the corresponding aromatic compound, **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**. This conclusion is also unanimous among the candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer.**\n    *   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n        `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n4.  **Match the Answer to the Options.**\n    *   The calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 16\n        B) 12\n        C) 22\n        D) 18\n    *   The calculated answer, 18, corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided methods.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Clue:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   **Analysis:** A mass fraction of 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Clue:** Z does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   **Analysis:** This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Clue:** Z is a widely used solvent, and hydrogenation of all other substances in the problem leads to Z.\n*   **Conclusion:** These clues strongly point to Z being the most common and stable C₆ cycloalkane solvent, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This also implies that all other compounds in the problem have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One of its components is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** Since the components do not decolorize bromine water, they must be saturated or aromatic. We know one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton (since it hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and must not react with bromine water. The only substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Clue:** Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** In catalytic reactions of cyclic hydrocarbons, disproportionation often involves a hydrogen transfer, producing the fully saturated compound (cyclohexane) and the fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound (benzene). This is consistent with our identification.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y. We can write the reaction for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A from X + Liquid B from X → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Principle:** The Law of Conservation of Atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms, this must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n**4. Matching with Options**\n\nThe calculated numerical answer is 18. The options provided are:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Consensus:** I will first review all 15 candidate answers to find the common logical thread and the final numerical result they arrive at.\n    *   **Step 1 (Identify Z):** All agents correctly identify substance Z as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). They use the hydrogen mass fraction (14.28% ≈ 1/7) to find the formula CₙH₂ₙ and combine this with the facts that it's saturated and a common solvent. This conclusion is unanimous and sound.\n    *   **Step 2 (Identify Y):** All agents correctly identify mixture Y as an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). This is based on the facts that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, its hydrogenation gives only cyclohexane, and it's formed by a disproportionation reaction (a hydrogen transfer). This conclusion is also unanimous and sound.\n    *   **Step 3 (Calculate the Answer):** All agents correctly apply the law of conservation of atoms to the reaction `Mixture X → Mixture Y`. They conclude that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   **Calculation:** Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   **Numerical Conclusion:** Every single agent correctly calculates the numerical answer to be **18**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Discrepancy:** The agents provide different final letter choices (A, B, C, D) despite all calculating the same number (18). This indicates that the errors are not in the chemical reasoning but in mapping the number 18 to the correct option letter. Some agents appear to be working with a scrambled or different list of options.\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Answer:** I will perform the final, correct mapping based on the options provided in the original question.\n    *   **Question's Options:** A) 16, B) 12, C) 18, D) 22\n    *   **Calculated Numerical Answer:** 18\n    *   **Correct Mapping:** The number 18 corresponds to option **C**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that formalizes this logic. The script will:\n    *   Define the number of hydrogen atoms in the components of mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n    *   Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms based on the principle of atom conservation.\n    *   Define the options as provided in the question.\n    *   Programmatically find and print the correct option letter corresponding to the calculated result.\n\nThis ensures a clear, verifiable, and correct path to the final answer, resolving the confusion seen in the candidate responses.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following the logical steps\n    agreed upon by all candidate answers and then correctly mapping the result\n    to the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the components of Mixture Y.\n    # Based on the unanimous analysis from all agents, Mixture Y is an equimolar\n    # mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n    # Cyclohexane (C6H12) is substance Z.\n    # Benzene (C6H6) is the other component.\n    h_atoms_in_cyclohexane = 12\n    h_atoms_in_benzene = 6\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the law of conservation of atoms.\n    # The reaction is: Mixture X -> Mixture Y.\n    # This is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n    # The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X\n    # must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    total_hydrogen_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_in_cyclohexane + h_atoms_in_benzene\n\n    # Step 3: State the options and find the correct choice.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 16,\n        \"B\": 12,\n        \"C\": 18,\n        \"D\": 22\n    }\n\n    final_choice = None\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        if value == total_hydrogen_atoms_in_X:\n            final_choice = choice\n            break\n\n    # Step 4: Print the detailed reasoning and the final answer.\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation of the answer:\")\n    print(\"1.

Identify Substance Z**\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. It is saturated and a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** The mass fraction 14.28% is approximately 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The fact that it is a widely used solvent strongly suggests it is the most common and stable example, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identify the Carbon Skeleton**\n*   **Information:** Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a critical clue. It means that all compounds in both mixtures must have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. One component is Z (cyclohexane). Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction.\n*   **Analysis:** Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components must be saturated or aromatic. We know one component is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton, not react with bromine water, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   The formation via disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer) also supports this, as a more hydrogenated species (cyclohexane) and a less hydrogenated species (benzene) are the logical products.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer**\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to an equimolar mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** Let the two components of mixture X be A and B. The reaction is:\n    `A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Analysis (Conservation of Atoms):** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:** We can sum the hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently shows that the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of atoms in the established chemical reaction. This conclusion is further supported by identifying the likely components of X as cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), whose hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nMatching the result with the given options:\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This also implies that all other compounds in the problem have a six-carbon ring skeleton, as they all hydrogenate to Z.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton, not decolorize bromine water, and hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y by disproportionation (a hydrogen transfer) also supports this, as a fully hydrogenated species (cyclohexane) and a fully dehydrogenated species (benzene) are the logical products.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the Law of Conservation of Atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n**4. Verification**\n*   To ensure this is chemically sound, we can identify the components of mixture X. They must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds (to decolorize bromine water) and must not have conjugated bonds. The pair that fits these criteria and whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18 is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which confirms the result derived from the conservation of atoms.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Setting this fraction to 1/7 (`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`) and solving for y gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem also states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most common and logical candidate is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification is consistent and chemically sound.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated, gives only Z. This means the second component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only substance that fits all these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic (unreactive with bromine water) and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer**\n*   Mixture X is converted to mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction, considering the equimolar nature of the mixtures, can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   According to the Law of Conservation of Atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (cyclohexane + benzene).\n*   Calculation: Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆) = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n**4.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation**: For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)` using approximate atomic masses. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation**: The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates that it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identity**: Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and stable cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identification fits all the given criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Composition**: We know that Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components. The other component must also have a six-carbon skeleton, as the hydrogenation of the entire mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n*   **Reaction Clue**: Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In the context of cyclic hydrocarbons, this is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction, which typically produces the fully saturated cycloalkane and the fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion**: Based on the above, the other component of Y must be the aromatic equivalent of cyclohexane, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. A mixture of cyclohexane and benzene fits all the criteria: it's an equimolar mixture of two liquids, neither component decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenation of the mixture (which converts benzene to cyclohexane) yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer\nThe final step is to use the law of conservation of atoms to find the answer.\n*   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid 1 from X + Liquid 2 from X → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms**: The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane = 12\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of benzene = 6\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be 18.\n\n### Step 4: Match with Options\nThe calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.

Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   We are told Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The clues that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\" and that all other substances in the problem are related to it through hydrogenation strongly suggest that Z is the most common and stable C₆ cycloalkane, **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is substance Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The entire mixture Y, when hydrogenated, yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only substance that fits all these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and hydrogenates to form cyclohexane.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\n*   Mixture X is converted into mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. This type of reaction involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms.\n*   The overall reaction can be written as:\n    `Mixture X (Liquid 1 + Liquid 2) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry for the components is 1:1.\n    `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   The fundamental principle of the Law of Conservation of Atoms dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical equation.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This value must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in Mixture Y = (Hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (Hydrogen atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n**4. Verification of the Chemical System**\n\n*   The components of mixture X must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have a C₆ ring skeleton, and lack conjugated double bonds. Their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits these conditions perfectly (10 + 8 = 18), confirming that the chemical scenario is valid.\n\nMatching the calculated result of 18 to the given options:\nA) 22\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1).

This percentage is a very close approximation of the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(y * atomic mass of H) / (x * atomic mass of C + y * atomic mass of H)`. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this becomes `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates it is a saturated compound.

This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation**: For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass)`, which can be approximated as `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. This means the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation and Identity**: The problem states that Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. Given that Z is also a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical and common compound fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point**: A critical piece of information is that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y yields *only* Z. This strongly implies that all compounds involved in the problem share the same six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y\nThe next step is to determine the components of mixture Y.\n*   **Properties**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Components**: We know one component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). The other component must also have a C₆ skeleton and, upon hydrogenation, yield cyclohexane. Since it does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only compound that fits these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and thus unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The formation of Y via a disproportionation reaction supports this conclusion. In catalytic reactions of cyclic hydrocarbons, disproportionation often involves a hydrogen transfer, resulting in the formation of the fully saturated compound (cyclohexane) and the fully dehydrogenated aromatic compound (benzene).\n*   **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation\nThe final step is to use the law of conservation of atoms to find the answer.\n*   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y. Since both are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be represented for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid A (from X) + Liquid B (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation**: We can calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products:\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Answer**: Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also be **18**.\n\n### Verification\nThis result can be verified by identifying plausible components for mixture X. They must be unsaturated C₆ rings without conjugated bonds, and their hydrogen atoms must sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits all conditions perfectly (10 + 8 = 18, both are non-conjugated unsaturated C₆ rings).\n\nThe calculated numerical answer is 18. Matching this with the provided options:\nA) 18\nB) 22\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
