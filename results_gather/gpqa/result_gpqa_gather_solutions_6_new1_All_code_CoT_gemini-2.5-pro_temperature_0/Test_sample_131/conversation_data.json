  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is critical for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet. The most likely scenario is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals arise from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings of both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** This mixture would show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from the first compound, and two 1H singlets from the second). This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** This mixture would also show three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets). This does not match the data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers with the following spectral features:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound gives one aromatic singlet, and both signals represent the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups on a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets is a critical clue, indicating no adjacent protons to cause splitting. The 2:1:1 ratio represents the relative number of protons in the three distinct methyl environments across the entire mixture.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Due to spin-spin coupling, the -CH2- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons as a triplet. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. This results in **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This **perfectly matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **perfectly matches** the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically determine the correct pair of compounds by simulating the combination of their individual 1H NMR spectra and comparing the result to the experimental data.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define Spectral Properties:** I will first define the predicted 1H NMR spectral characteristics for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. This includes the number of aromatic and aliphatic signals, their integrations (number of protons), and their multiplicities (singlet, multiplet, etc.). I will pay close attention to the analysis of symmetry to avoid common errors.\n2.  **Define the Options:** I will create a data structure that correctly maps the options (A, B, C, D) to the pairs of compounds as listed in the question. This is crucial to prevent the labeling errors seen in some of the provided candidate answers.\n3.  **Iterate and Evaluate:** I will loop through each option. For each pair of compounds, I will combine their predicted spectra to simulate the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n4.  **Compare with Experimental Data:** The simulated spectrum for each option will be compared against the target experimental data:\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Must have exactly two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Must have exactly three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n5.  **Conclude:** The option that perfectly matches both criteria will be identified as the correct answer. The entire process, including the reasoning for each step, will be printed.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for a mixture of two aromatic compounds to identify them.\n    The function will:\n    1.

Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. Each molecule has (10*2+2-14)/2 = 4 degrees of unsaturation, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting. The 2:1:1 ratio represents the combined total of methyl protons from both compounds. Since each C10H14 isomer has 14 protons, and the aromatic region accounts for some, the aliphatic region accounts for the rest. For tetramethylbenzenes, there are 2 aromatic protons and 12 methyl protons. In a 1:1 mixture, there are 24 total methyl protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1). The actual integrations are (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H. We are looking for a combination of compounds that produces one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the experimental data.\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region. Therefore, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor is the aliphatic region.\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need the combined signals to be three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1 (which we determined corresponds to actual integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\nLet's test the remaining options by combining their aliphatic signals:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: **One singlet (12H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: **Two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** The mixture will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for the experimental data.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in a total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals arise from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings of both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, ruling out any groups that would show spin-spin splitting.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry, which dictates the number of chemically equivalent proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out option **B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: Some analyses incorrectly predict two 1H singlets, but the plane of symmetry makes them equivalent).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, which gives the required 1:1 ratio. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need the combined signals to be three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n        *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match for the aliphatic data.**\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have a total of four aliphatic singlets. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination correctly predicts two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. Each of the four candidate molecules fits this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet. The simplest and most likely scenario is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups on a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets indicates that these methyl groups are not adjacent to any ring protons. The total number of aliphatic protons for one C10H14 tetramethylbenzene isomer is 12 (4 methyl groups x 3H). In a 1:1 mixture, the total is 24 aliphatic protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    Therefore, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that together produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is based on its molecular symmetry, which determines the number of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups.

This also eliminates option D from consideration.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This plane of symmetry makes the two protons at positions 4 and 6 chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, giving the required 1:1 ratio. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:**\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene).\n        *   Total: **Four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Aliphatic signals: One **12H** singlet (from Durene) + two **6H** singlets (from Prehnitene).\n        *   Total: **Three** aliphatic singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match for the experimental data.**\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene).\n        *   Total: This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination correctly predicts two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The key features of the combined 1H NMR spectrum are:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that the mixture is 1:1 means that the signals from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum. The 2:1:1 ratio in the aliphatic region corresponds to the relative number of protons in the three distinct methyl environments in the entire mixture. Since each C10H14 isomer has 14 protons total (2 aromatic, 12 aliphatic), the 1:1 mixture has 24 aliphatic protons. The 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts total) corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each candidate compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Due to spin-spin splitting, the -CH2- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons as a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, and any option containing it is incorrect.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: Several candidate answers incorrectly state this compound gives two 1H singlets, which is a common error).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, giving the required 1:1 ratio. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need a combination of signals from two compounds that results in three total singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: **Four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: At least **four** aliphatic singlets (one 6H signal might overlap). This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   Combined: A total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the experimental data.**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture spectrum:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four candidate compounds fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial because it means the proton integrations from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the mixture is 1:1, this implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals must represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets indicates the methyl groups are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting. The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 24 (12 from each compound). The 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts total) corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each component based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH₂- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH₃ protons, and the -CH₃- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to 12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (Two 6H singlets) + (One 6H, one 3H, and one 3H singlet).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four distinct signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly shows **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined:** The mixture shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (One 12H singlet) + (One 6H, one 3H, and one 3H singlet).\n    *   Combined: This would result in four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following key information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that the mixture is 1:1 means that signals from each compound contribute equally to the total integration. The 1:1 ratio in the aromatic region implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n\nThe 2:1:1 ratio in the aliphatic region represents the combined total of methyl protons from both compounds. Since each C10H14 isomer has 14 protons, and the aromatic rings have 2 protons each, there are 12 aliphatic protons per molecule (from 4 methyl groups). In a 1:1 mixture, there are 24 total aliphatic protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the actual integrations are:\n*   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n*   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\nSo, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that together produce one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons are adjacent to -CH3- protons, which would cause splitting, resulting in a quartet. The -CH3- protons would be a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Based on a symmetry analysis, there is a plane passing through C2 and C5. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), the one at C2 (unique, 3H), and the one at C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find the pair whose combined signals match the experimental data (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. The mixture would correctly show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** The mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. The mixture would correctly show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by evaluating the provided candidate answers and the underlying chemistry.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following key information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n1.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n2.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all aliphatic signals are singlets is a crucial clue. The integration ratios are also definitive.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is between two methyl groups, while the proton at C6 is adjacent to a proton and a methyl group. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1, C3}, {C2}, and {C5}. This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* Several candidate answers incorrectly state that this compound gives one 2H aromatic singlet. The correct prediction is two 1H singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-) due to spin-spin splitting. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **immediately eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Elimination based on 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Option D contains 1,4-diethylbenzene and is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aromatic Signals:** The experimental data shows **two** aromatic singlets.\n    *   A mixture containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would be problematic. This compound *by itself* produces two 1H singlets. When mixed with another tetramethylbenzene isomer (which produces one 2H singlet), the total spectrum would show **three** aromatic signals (one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets).\n    *   This contradicts the experimental data. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must be incorrect. This eliminates options **A** and **B**.\n\n*   **Confirmation of the Remaining Option:**\n    *   Only **Option C** remains: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n    *   Let's verify if this mixture matches the data.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one singlet (12H)**. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two singlets (6H each)**. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the individual spectra and their combinations shows that only the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is consistent with all the provided 1H NMR data. This corresponds to option C. Many of the candidate answers arrive at the correct pair of compounds but select the wrong letter, or use flawed reasoning (especially for the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene). The correct reasoning leads directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Careful Points & Interpretation:**\n1.  **1:1 Mixture:** The signals from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n2.  **Aromatic Signals:** The presence of two singlets in a 1:1 ratio for a 1:1 mixture strongly implies that each of the two compounds contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals). If one compound gave two signals on its own, the total number of signals in the mixture would likely be three or more, which contradicts the data.\n3.  **Aliphatic Signals:** The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue. The 2:1:1 ratio represents the combined total of methyl protons from both compounds. Each C10H14 tetramethylbenzene isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (4 methyl groups). In a 1:1 mixture, there are 24 total aliphatic protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1=4). Therefore, the actual integrations of the three signals are:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    We are looking for a combination of two compounds that produces one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a **quartet** by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a **triplet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 is chemically different from the proton at C6. They are not related by symmetry. They produce **two distinct singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, we can evaluate the options. The experimental data requires two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means the mixture must be composed of two compounds that *each* contribute *one* 2H singlet.\n\n*   **Good Candidates for the Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (one 2H singlet) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (one 2H singlet).\n*   **Bad Candidate for the Mixture:** 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (produces two 1H singlets by itself).\n\nThis analysis immediately eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Options A, C, and D), because mixing it with another compound would result in three aromatic signals, contradicting the data. The only remaining possibility is Option B.\n\nLet's confirm that Option B matches all the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion: This option is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals arise from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings of both compounds. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each compound). The 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to actual integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, since (2+1+1=4 parts), and (2/4)*24H=12H, (1/4)*24H=6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are made equivalent by the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), the one at C2 (unique, 3H), and the one at C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (equivalent, 6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (equivalent, 6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The protons on the -CH2- group are split by the -CH3- protons, resulting in a quartet, and the -CH3- protons are split by the -CH2- protons, resulting in a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be immediately ruled out**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio). This matches.\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet, 12H) + Isodurene (3 singlets, 6H, 3H, 3H) -> **Four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match the \"three singlets\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio). This matches.\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (2 singlets, 6H, 6H) + Isodurene (3 singlets, 6H, 3H, 3H) -> **Four or five aliphatic singlets** (depending on overlap). This does not match the \"three singlets\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene contributes **one singlet (12H)**. Prehnitene contributes **two singlets (6H and 6H)**. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we will perform a systematic analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers. The key features of the combined spectrum are:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This is the sum of all methyl protons from both compounds. The total number of aliphatic protons is 14 per molecule, so 28 in the mixture. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 parts, meaning the actual integrations correspond to (2/4)*28H = 14H, (1/4)*28H = 7H, and (1/4)*28H = 7H. This seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate. Each compound is C10H14. The benzene ring accounts for C6H2, so the substituents are C4H12 (four methyl groups). The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts) of 24 protons means the signals integrate to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to spin-spin splitting. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This compound would produce **two separate 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a combination that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **Eliminating options with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** If 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene were in the mixture, it would contribute two 1H aromatic singlets. When mixed with any of the other isomers (which contribute one 2H singlet), the total spectrum would show *three* aromatic signals. This contradicts the data. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluating the remaining option:**\n\n    **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nThe question describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄. The key features of the combined spectrum are:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the alkyl protons (in this case, methyl groups) from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a critical clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any carbons bearing protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each candidate is based on its molecular symmetry, which determines the number of chemically distinct proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH₂- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH₃ protons, and the -CH₃ protons would be split into a triplet. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates **Option C**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that combines the individual spectra to match the experimental data. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H aromatic singlet, so any 1:1 mixture of two of them will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor is the number and ratio of the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (Two 6H singlets) + (Three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would result in four or five total aliphatic signals, which does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (One 12H singlet) + (Three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would result in four total aliphatic signals, which does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly shows **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one singlet (12H)**. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the experimental data.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described ¹H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we will perform a step-by-step analysis of the expected ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n*   **Sample:** A 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This is the combined signal from the methyl groups of both compounds. The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue, ruling out any compound with protons that would be split (like ethyl groups). The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. The 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts total) corresponds to actual proton counts of (2/4)*24 = 12H, (1/4)*24 = 6H, and (1/4)*24 = 6H. We are looking for a combination of signals that gives one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nThe prediction is based on molecular symmetry, which determines how many unique proton environments exist.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups. The -CH₂- protons are adjacent to -CH₃- protons, which would lead to splitting, producing a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three unique sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\nAll three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. The decision must be made by analyzing the combined aliphatic signals. We need a combination that results in three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (e.g., 6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H, assuming one overlap). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in a total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   Combined: The mixture shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   Ratio Check: 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the experimental data.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This is critical for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet. The most likely scenario is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals arise from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings of both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out **Option B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent.

They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.

This does not match the data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers with the following spectral features:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound gives one aromatic singlet, and both signals represent the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups on a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets is a critical clue, indicating no adjacent protons to cause splitting. The 2:1:1 ratio represents the relative number of protons in the three distinct methyl environments across the entire mixture.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Due to spin-spin coupling, the -CH2- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons as a triplet. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. This results in **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since both signals represent 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This **perfectly matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **perfectly matches** the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically determine the correct pair of compounds by simulating the combination of their individual 1H NMR spectra and comparing the result to the experimental data.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define Spectral Properties:** I will first define the predicted 1H NMR spectral characteristics for each of the four candidate compounds based on their molecular symmetry. This includes the number of aromatic and aliphatic signals, their integrations (number of protons), and their multiplicities (singlet, multiplet, etc.). I will pay close attention to the analysis of symmetry to avoid common errors.\n2.  **Define the Options:** I will create a data structure that correctly maps the options (A, B, C, D) to the pairs of compounds as listed in the question. This is crucial to prevent the labeling errors seen in some of the provided candidate answers.\n3.  **Iterate and Evaluate:** I will loop through each option. For each pair of compounds, I will combine their predicted spectra to simulate the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n4.  **Compare with Experimental Data:** The simulated spectrum for each option will be compared against the target experimental data:\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Must have exactly two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Must have exactly three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n5.  **Conclude:** The option that perfectly matches both criteria will be identified as the correct answer. The entire process, including the reasoning for each step, will be printed.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for a mixture of two aromatic compounds to identify them.\n    The function will:\n    1.

Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. Each molecule has (10*2+2-14)/2 = 4 degrees of unsaturation, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting. The 2:1:1 ratio represents the combined total of methyl protons from both compounds. Since each C10H14 isomer has 14 protons, and the aromatic region accounts for some, the aliphatic region accounts for the rest. For tetramethylbenzenes, there are 2 aromatic protons and 12 methyl protons. In a 1:1 mixture, there are 24 total methyl protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1). The actual integrations are (2/4)*24H = 12H, (1/4)*24H = 6H, and (1/4)*24H = 6H. We are looking for a combination of compounds that produces one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the experimental data.\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region. Therefore, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor is the aliphatic region.\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need the combined signals to be three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1 (which we determined corresponds to actual integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\nLet's test the remaining options by combining their aliphatic signals:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: **One singlet (12H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: **Two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** The mixture will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for the experimental data.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (12H).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in a total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: Two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a combined integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals arise from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings of both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a key clue, ruling out any groups that would show spin-spin splitting.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry, which dictates the number of chemically equivalent proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out option **B**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: Some analyses incorrectly predict two 1H singlets, but the plane of symmetry makes them equivalent).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, which gives the required 1:1 ratio. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need the combined signals to be three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n        *   The combined spectrum shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match for the aliphatic data.**\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The combined spectrum would have a total of four aliphatic singlets. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination correctly predicts two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided by the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. Each of the four candidate molecules fits this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet. The simplest and most likely scenario is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with a relative integration ratio of 2:1:1. The chemical shift is characteristic of methyl groups on a benzene ring. The fact that they are all singlets indicates that these methyl groups are not adjacent to any ring protons. The total number of aliphatic protons for one C10H14 tetramethylbenzene isomer is 12 (4 methyl groups x 3H). In a 1:1 mixture, the total is 24 aliphatic protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1). We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    Therefore, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that together produce three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each compound is based on its molecular symmetry, which determines the number of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups.

This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, giving the required 1:1 ratio. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:**\n\n    *   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Aliphatic signals: One 12H singlet (from Durene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene).\n        *   Total: **Four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n    *   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Aliphatic signals: One **12H** singlet (from Durene) + two **6H** singlets (from Prehnitene).\n        *   Total: **Three** aliphatic singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n        *   **This is a perfect match for the experimental data.**\n\n    *   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n        *   Aliphatic signals: Two 6H singlets (from Prehnitene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from Isodurene).\n        *   Total: This would result in at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n    *   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination correctly predicts two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The key features of the combined 1H NMR spectrum are:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that the mixture is 1:1 means that the signals from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum. The 2:1:1 ratio in the aliphatic region corresponds to the relative number of protons in the three distinct methyl environments in the entire mixture. Since each C10H14 isomer has 14 protons total (2 aromatic, 12 aliphatic), the 1:1 mixture has 24 aliphatic protons. The 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts total) corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each candidate compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). Due to spin-spin splitting, the -CH2- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons as a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, and any option containing it is incorrect.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**. (Note: Several candidate answers incorrectly state this compound gives two 1H singlets, which is a common error).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Aromatic Check:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) each produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will result in two 2H singlets, giving the required 1:1 ratio. The decision must be made based on the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Check:** We need a combination of signals from two compounds that results in three total singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: **Four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: At least **four** aliphatic singlets (one 6H signal might overlap). This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   Combined: A total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the experimental data.**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture spectrum:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four candidate compounds fit this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial because it means the proton integrations from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the mixture is 1:1, this implies that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals must represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets indicates the methyl groups are not adjacent to any protons that would cause splitting. The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 24 (12 from each compound). The 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts total) corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each component based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH₂- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH₃ protons, and the -CH₃- protons would be split into a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be **immediately eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to 12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (Two 6H singlets) + (One 6H, one 3H, and one 3H singlet).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four distinct signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly shows **two singlets** with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined:** The mixture shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (One 12H singlet) + (One 6H, one 3H, and one 3H singlet).\n    *   Combined: This would result in four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets.\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following key information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that the mixture is 1:1 means that signals from each compound contribute equally to the total integration. The 1:1 ratio in the aromatic region implies that the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n\nThe 2:1:1 ratio in the aliphatic region represents the combined total of methyl protons from both compounds. Since each C10H14 isomer has 14 protons, and the aromatic rings have 2 protons each, there are 12 aliphatic protons per molecule (from 4 methyl groups). In a 1:1 mixture, there are 24 total aliphatic protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the actual integrations are:\n*   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n*   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\nSo, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that together produce one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons are adjacent to -CH3- protons, which would cause splitting, resulting in a quartet. The -CH3- protons would be a triplet. The problem explicitly states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Based on a symmetry analysis, there is a plane passing through C2 and C5. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), the one at C2 (unique, 3H), and the one at C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find the pair whose combined signals match the experimental data (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Eliminated.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. The mixture would correctly show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one 6H signal overlaps). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Spectrum:** The mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. The mixture would correctly show two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by evaluating the provided candidate answers and the underlying chemistry.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following key information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n1.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n2.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe fact that all aliphatic signals are singlets is a crucial clue. The integration ratios are also definitive.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the options, we must first predict the spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is between two methyl groups, while the proton at C6 is adjacent to a proton and a methyl group. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1, C3}, {C2}, and {C5}. This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* Several candidate answers incorrectly state that this compound gives one 2H aromatic singlet. The correct prediction is two 1H singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-) due to spin-spin splitting. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **immediately eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Elimination based on 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Option D contains 1,4-diethylbenzene and is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Elimination based on Aromatic Signals:** The experimental data shows **two** aromatic singlets.\n    *   A mixture containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would be problematic. This compound *by itself* produces two 1H singlets. When mixed with another tetramethylbenzene isomer (which produces one 2H singlet), the total spectrum would show **three** aromatic signals (one 2H singlet and two 1H singlets).\n    *   This contradicts the experimental data. Therefore, any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must be incorrect. This eliminates options **A** and **B**.\n\n*   **Confirmation of the Remaining Option:**\n    *   Only **Option C** remains: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n    *   Let's verify if this mixture matches the data.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one singlet (12H)**. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two singlets (6H each)**. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the individual spectra and their combinations shows that only the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is consistent with all the provided 1H NMR data. This corresponds to option C. Many of the candidate answers arrive at the correct pair of compounds but select the wrong letter, or use flawed reasoning (especially for the spectrum of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene). The correct reasoning leads directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Careful Points & Interpretation:**\n1.  **1:1 Mixture:** The signals from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n2.  **Aromatic Signals:** The presence of two singlets in a 1:1 ratio for a 1:1 mixture strongly implies that each of the two compounds contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals). If one compound gave two signals on its own, the total number of signals in the mixture would likely be three or more, which contradicts the data.\n3.  **Aliphatic Signals:** The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue. The 2:1:1 ratio represents the combined total of methyl protons from both compounds. Each C10H14 tetramethylbenzene isomer has 12 aliphatic protons (4 methyl groups). In a 1:1 mixture, there are 24 total aliphatic protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 parts (2+1+1=4). Therefore, the actual integrations of the three signals are:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    We are looking for a combination of two compounds that produces one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict its spectrum.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH2- protons would be split into a **quartet** by the adjacent -CH3- protons, and the -CH3- protons would be split into a **triplet**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates **Option A**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 is chemically different from the proton at C6. They are not related by symmetry. They produce **two distinct singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, or 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, we can evaluate the options. The experimental data requires two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This means the mixture must be composed of two compounds that *each* contribute *one* 2H singlet.\n\n*   **Good Candidates for the Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (one 2H singlet) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (one 2H singlet).\n*   **Bad Candidate for the Mixture:** 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (produces two 1H singlets by itself).\n\nThis analysis immediately eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Options A, C, and D), because mixing it with another compound would result in three aromatic signals, contradicting the data. The only remaining possibility is Option B.\n\nLet's confirm that Option B matches all the data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes **one 12H singlet**. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes **two 6H singlets**. The combined spectrum shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion: This option is a perfect match.**\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must carefully interpret the information provided for the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a critical piece of information for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that the number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second singlet. The most direct interpretation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and these signals represent an equal number of protons (e.g., both are 2H signals).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals arise from the methyl groups attached to the benzene rings of both compounds. The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 24 (12 from each compound). The 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to actual integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, since (2+1+1=4 parts), and (2/4)*24H=12H, (1/4)*24H=6H.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo find the correct pair, we must first predict the spectrum that each individual compound would produce based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are made equivalent by the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent, 6H), the one at C2 (unique, 3H), and the one at C5 (unique, 3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 (equivalent, 6H) and the pair at C2/C3 (equivalent, 6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The protons on the -CH2- group are split by the -CH3- protons, resulting in a quartet, and the -CH3- protons are split by the -CH2- protons, resulting in a triplet. Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **this compound can be immediately ruled out**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that produces two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: Durene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio). This matches.\n    *   Aliphatic: Durene (1 singlet, 12H) + Isodurene (3 singlets, 6H, 3H, 3H) -> **Four aliphatic singlets**. This does not match the \"three singlets\" data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: Prehnitene (1 singlet, 2H) + Isodurene (1 singlet, 2H) -> Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio). This matches.\n    *   Aliphatic: Prehnitene (2 singlets, 6H, 6H) + Isodurene (3 singlets, 6H, 3H, 3H) -> **Four or five aliphatic singlets** (depending on overlap). This does not match the \"three singlets\" data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene contributes **one singlet (12H)**. Prehnitene contributes **two singlets (6H and 6H)**. The combined spectrum will show a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the data.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we will perform a systematic analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers. The key features of the combined spectrum are:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and each singlet represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This is the sum of all methyl protons from both compounds. The total number of aliphatic protons is 14 per molecule, so 28 in the mixture. A 2:1:1 ratio has 4 parts, meaning the actual integrations correspond to (2/4)*28H = 14H, (1/4)*28H = 7H, and (1/4)*28H = 7H. This seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate. Each compound is C10H14. The benzene ring accounts for C6H2, so the substituents are C4H12 (four methyl groups). The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts) of 24 protons means the signals integrate to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of chemically distinct proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region due to spin-spin splitting. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 (6H) and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3 (6H). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This compound would produce **two separate 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe are looking for a combination that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (12H, 6H, 6H).\n\n*   **Eliminating options with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** If 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene were in the mixture, it would contribute two 1H aromatic singlets. When mixed with any of the other isomers (which contribute one 2H singlet), the total spectrum would show *three* aromatic signals. This contradicts the data. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.\n\n*   **Evaluating the remaining option:**\n\n    **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H integration, which is a **1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, a systematic, step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nThe question describes a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄. The key features of the combined spectrum are:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals are the sum of all the alkyl protons (in this case, methyl groups) from both compounds. The fact that they are all singlets is a critical clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any carbons bearing protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nThe predicted spectrum for each candidate is based on its molecular symmetry, which determines the number of chemically distinct proton environments.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups. The -CH₂- protons would be split into a quartet by the adjacent -CH₃ protons, and the -CH₃ protons would be split into a triplet. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates **Option C**.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair at C1/C4 and the \"inner\" pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that combines the individual spectra to match the experimental data. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one 2H aromatic singlet, so any 1:1 mixture of two of them will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio. The deciding factor is the number and ratio of the aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (Two 6H singlets) + (Three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would result in four or five total aliphatic signals, which does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: (One 12H singlet) + (Three singlets: 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   This combination would result in four total aliphatic signals, which does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture correctly shows **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives **one singlet (12H)**. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the experimental data.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described ¹H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we will perform a step-by-step analysis of the expected ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n*   **Sample:** A 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal. The simplest explanation is that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and each signal represents the same number of protons (e.g., 2H each).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This is the combined signal from the methyl groups of both compounds. The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue, ruling out any compound with protons that would be split (like ethyl groups). The total number of aliphatic protons in the mixture is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. The 2:1:1 ratio (4 parts total) corresponds to actual proton counts of (2/4)*24 = 12H, (1/4)*24 = 6H, and (1/4)*24 = 6H. We are looking for a combination of signals that gives one 12H singlet and two 6H singlets.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nThe prediction is based on molecular symmetry, which determines how many unique proton environments exist.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups. The -CH₂- protons are adjacent to -CH₃- protons, which would lead to splitting, producing a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out option **A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent.

They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" pair (C2, C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three unique sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\nAll three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a single 2H aromatic singlet. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. The decision must be made by analyzing the combined aliphatic signals. We need a combination that results in three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in at least four signals (e.g., 6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H, assuming one overlap). This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined: This would result in a total of four aliphatic singlets. This does not match the \"three signals\" data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   Combined: The mixture shows a total of **three aliphatic singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   Ratio Check: 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the experimental data.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
