Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key intermediate is a highly reactive species called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. The starting material has two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways. This leads to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond. This means Pathway A is the major, faster pathway, but Pathway B is still possible.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When numbering the ring to give the amino group priority (at position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The addition of the -NH₂ group followed by protonation yields **aniline**.\n    *   Pathway B yields one distinct product.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Products**\nBy combining the products from all possible pathways, we find three unique organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n**5. Matching with the Options**\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) 2\nB) 4\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nOur analysis shows that there are 3 possible products, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type and Reagents**\nThe reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide) and sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base. These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called a **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base, abstracting an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identify all possible abstraction sites.** The starting material has two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Consider all possible reaction pathways.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products, so we must consider the consequences of abstraction from both sites.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H⁺ from C6. The subsequent loss of Br⁻ from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This creates the intermediate **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D⁺ from C2. The subsequent loss of Br⁻ from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this pathway, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This creates the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Kinetic Isotope Effect.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so Pathway A (H-abstraction) is faster. This affects the relative amounts (yields) of the products, but since Pathway B is still possible, its products must be included in the total count.\n\nConclusion of Step 2: Two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. Protonation of the resulting carbanion at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. Protonation of the resulting carbanion at C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline** (after renumbering the ring to give the -NH₂ group the C1 position).\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** This yields **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Unique Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products. These molecules are isotopologues and are chemically distinct.\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Count to the Given Options**\nThe options provided are:\nA) 2\nB) 3\nC) 4\nD) 1\n\nThe analysis shows there are 3 possible products, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically trace the chemical reaction described in the question to determine all possible outcomes. This is a classic problem in organic chemistry involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Elimination Step**: The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, reacts with the strong base NaNH₂. The base can remove a proton (H) from the C6 position or a deuteron (D) from the C2 position. These are the two positions *ortho* to the bromine. This will lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n2.  **Analyze the Addition Step**: The nucleophile, NH₂⁻, will then attack each of the benzyne intermediates. I will determine the products formed from the attack on each intermediate.\n3.  **Count the Products**: I will collect all the unique products from all possible reaction pathways. The total number of unique products will be the answer.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will use Python sets to represent the intermediates and final products, as sets automatically handle uniqueness.

The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   *Note*: This pathway is kinetically favored due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond).

Identify the Reaction Type and Reagents**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen, at position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base, and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), which acts as a base. It abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Possible Abstraction Sites:** In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Two Possible Pathways:** Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   *Note:* This pathway is kinetically favored due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond). This means this pathway produces the major products, but the minor pathway is still possible.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (:NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne's strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**4.

Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key intermediate in this mechanism is a highly reactive species called a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a base to abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Identify Ortho Positions:** In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Consider All Pathways:** The question asks for all *possible* organic products. Therefore, we must consider abstraction from both positions, even though the C-H bond breaks more easily than the C-D bond (due to the kinetic isotope effect). This leads to two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical.

The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbering the ring to give the amino group priority (at position 1), the deuterium is at position 3.

Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\nThe reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂) in a solvent like liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key to this mechanism is the formation of a highly reactive intermediate called a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins when the amide ion (NH₂⁻), a powerful base, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\nThe starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways. The difference in bond strength between C-H and C-D (the kinetic isotope effect) affects the *rate* of these pathways, but not their possibility.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbering the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *Pathway A yields two distinct products.*\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) followed by protonation leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n    *Pathway B yields one distinct product.*\n\n**4.

All candidate answers correctly identify this mechanism.\n\n*   **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. The starting material has two distinct ortho positions:\n    1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen (H).\n    2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium (D).\n\n    Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both abstraction pathways must be considered:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in **3-deuterobenzyne**. The deuterium at C2 remains.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and Br from C1 results in **non-deuterated benzyne**. The deuterium is lost in this step.\n\n    This leads to the formation of **two different benzyne intermediates**. This conclusion is a consensus among all sound analyses provided.\n\n*   **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile, also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical.

Analysis of the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic organic chemistry problem that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, with a benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. The starting material has two different ortho positions:\n    *   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    This leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in **3-deuterobenzyne**. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This pathway is kinetically favored due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds).\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and Br from C1 results in **non-deuterated benzyne**. The deuterium is removed from the molecule in this step. Although slower, this pathway is still possible.\n\n*   **Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate.

Nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from non-deuterated benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond yields the same single product:\n        3.  **Aniline**.\n\n### **2.

Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The key intermediate is a highly reactive species called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. The starting material has two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways. This leads to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Due to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond. This means Pathway A is the major, faster pathway, but Pathway B is still possible.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When numbering the ring to give the amino group priority (at position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The addition of the -NH₂ group followed by protonation yields **aniline**.\n    *   Pathway B yields one distinct product.\n\n**4.

The subsequent loss of Br⁻ from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This creates the intermediate **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D⁺ from C2. The subsequent loss of Br⁻ from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this pathway, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This creates the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Kinetic Isotope Effect.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so Pathway A (H-abstraction) is faster. This affects the relative amounts (yields) of the products, but since Pathway B is still possible, its products must be included in the total count.\n\nConclusion of Step 2: Two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. Protonation of the resulting carbanion at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. Protonation of the resulting carbanion at C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline** (after renumbering the ring to give the -NH₂ group the C1 position).\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** This yields **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Unique Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products. These molecules are isotopologues and are chemically distinct.\n1.

Identify the Reaction Type and Reagents**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an exceptionally strong base, and the amide ion (NH₂⁻) is also a potent nucleophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive, unstable intermediate called a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: The Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe reaction begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base. It abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying all possible abstraction sites.** The starting material has two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Considering all possible pathways.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products. Therefore, we must consider the consequences of abstraction from both sites, even if one pathway is faster than the other.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This creates the first intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This creates the second intermediate: **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Step 1:** Two distinct benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: The Addition Step (Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Recognizing unsymmetrical intermediates.** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. According to IUPAC naming conventions, the ring is numbered to give the principal functional group (-NH₂) the lowest possible number (C1). Therefore, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) followed by protonation leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n    *   Pathway B yields one distinct product.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion: Counting the Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways originating from the two benzyne intermediates, we find a total of three unique organic products:\n1.

This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen, at position C2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base, and liquid ammonia is the solvent.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (:NH₂⁻), which acts as a base. It abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Possible Abstraction Sites:** In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Two Possible Pathways:** Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   *Note:* This pathway is kinetically favored due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond). This means this pathway produces the major products, but the minor pathway is still possible.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (:NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne's strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at position C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n\n**4.

This is a classic organic chemistry problem that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, with a benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. The starting material has two different ortho positions:\n    *   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    This leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in **3-deuterobenzyne**. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This pathway is kinetically favored due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds).\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and Br from C1 results in **non-deuterated benzyne**. The deuterium is removed from the molecule in this step.

This leads to two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Kinetic Isotope Effect):** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so Pathway A (H-abstraction) is kinetically favored and occurs faster. However, Pathway B is still possible and must be included to find all potential products.\n\n**3. Step 2: The Addition Step (Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbering the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n\n**4.
