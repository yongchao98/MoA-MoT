Identify the relevant physical principles:**\nThis problem involves the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between a particle's energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle:** This principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum in the same direction (Δp_x) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. The most precise form is:\n    Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p). We need to find how the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) relates to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp).\n\n**2. Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\nThe relationship between small changes (or uncertainties) in energy and momentum can be found by taking the derivative of the energy E with respect to momentum p.\nΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp\n\nThe derivative dE/dp is the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's classical velocity, v. This is true for both the non-relativistic (E = p²/2m) and relativistic (E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²) cases.\nSo, the relationship is:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nSince the motion is along the x-direction, we have:\nΔE ≈ v_x * Δp_x\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x):**\nFrom the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty occurs when we take the equality:\nΔx * Δp_x = ħ / 2\n\nWe can solve for the minimum uncertainty in momentum, Δp_x:\nΔp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n**4.

This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. There are two relevant forms:\n    *   Position-Momentum Uncertainty: Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2\n    *   Energy-Time Uncertainty: ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n\n2.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   Speed of the electron, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   Uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx = 0.1 nm.\n    *   We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.\n\n3.  **Formulate a plan:** We can solve this problem in two equivalent ways.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Using Position-Momentum Uncertainty.**\n        a. Use the position-momentum uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).\n        b. Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n        c. Calculate the final value for ΔE.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Energy-Time Uncertainty.**\n        a. Relate the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in time (Δt) using the electron's velocity.\n        b. Use the energy-time uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The electron's speed (v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s) is about 2/3 the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s). At such high speeds, relativistic effects are significant. This means we must use the relativistic relationship between energy and momentum, not the classical one.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   Classical: E = p²/2m\n    *   Relativistic: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    The derivative dE/dp gives the particle's velocity, v. For the relativistic case, dE/dp = v, which leads to the simple relationship ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All values must be in standard SI units before calculation. The position uncertainty Δx = 0.1 nm must be converted to meters (1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m).\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   **Minimum Uncertainty:** The uncertainty principle gives a lower bound (≥). The question asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so we can use the equality for our estimation: Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ/2. For order-of-magnitude estimates, even Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ is often sufficient and won't change the final answer choice.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will use the first method (Position-Momentum).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n\nAccording to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Δx = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nΔp_min ≈ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp_min ≈ 0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**Step 2: Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the relationship between energy and momentum is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². To find how a small change in momentum (dp) affects energy (dE), we differentiate this equation with respect to p:\nd(E²)/dp = d((pc)² + (m₀c²)²)/dp\n2E (dE/dp) = 2pc²\ndE/dp = pc²/E\n\nIt is a known result from special relativity that pc²/E = v, the velocity of the particle. Therefore:\ndE/dp = v\n\nWe can approximate the uncertainties using this relationship:\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\nUsing the values we have:\n*   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δp_min ≈ 0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\nΔE_min ≈ (2 × 10⁸ m/s) × (0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe estimated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.

Relating Uncertainty in Momentum to Uncertainty in Energy:**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's energy (E) and its momentum (p) is described by the energy-momentum relation. The particle's group velocity ($v_g$), which is its actual speed, is given by the derivative of energy with respect to momentum:\n\n$v = \\frac{dE}{dp}$\n\nFor small uncertainties, we can approximate this relationship as:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta p_x} \\approx v$\n\nRearranging this gives us the formula for the uncertainty in energy:\n\n$\\Delta E \\approx v \\cdot \\Delta p_x$\n\n**3.

My proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  Start with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum, which states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we can use the equality Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx).\n2.  Determine the relationship between uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The general relationship, which holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases, is ΔE ≈ v * Δp, where v is the velocity of the particle.\n3.  By combining these two relationships, we get ΔE ≈ v * (ħ / (2 * Δx)).\n4.  I will now perform a search to get the precise value for the reduced Planck constant to use in the calculation.\n\n**Skeptic**\nThe search results confirm the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s. The plan to use the formula ΔE ≈ v * Δp, where Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx), is sound. The logic holds, and we have the necessary constants. There are no apparent failure modes or missing facts.
