    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the law of radioactive decay.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` remaining after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    where `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the reference frame where the time `t` is measured (the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. Its lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to its proper lifetime (`τ₀`, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. They are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    `t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** Substituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles `f = N/N₀` that reach the detector:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios:** We have two scenarios with different Lorentz factors and different fractions of surviving particles. Let's write the equation for each case. The values for `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` are constants.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor: `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction surviving: `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   The equation is: `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ₀))`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor: `γ₂` (this is what we need to find)\n        *   Fraction surviving: `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   The equation is: `2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\n6.  **Solving for γ₂:** Let's manipulate the equations by taking the natural logarithm of both sides.\n    *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`\n        `-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)`\n        `ln(3) * 20 = (R/c) / τ₀`\n\n    *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)`\n        `ln(3/2) * γ₂ = (R/c) / τ₀`\n\n    Since the term `(R/c) / τ₀` is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:\n    `ln(3) * 20 = ln(3/2) * γ₂`\n\n    Now, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculation:** We can compute the value of `γ₂` using this formula. A Python script is suitable for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor for the first scenario\ngamma1 = 20.0\n\n# Calculate the value of ln(3) and ln(3/2)\nln3 = math.log(3)\nln1_5 = math.log(1.5)\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor, gamma2\ngamma2 = gamma1 * ln3 / ln1_5\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n> EXECUTING CODE...\n> 54.18839218823672\n> EXECUTION SUCCEEDED\n\nThe calculation yields `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 68\nC) 40\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to 54. Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires us to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the exponential law of radioactive decay.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The fraction of particles, `f = N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` is given by the decay formula:\n    `f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    where `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is dilated. Its lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime `τ₀`). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel a distance `R` (the radius of the detector) to reach the walls. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time taken to reach the wall in the lab frame is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Formula:** By substituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector wall:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n    Let's define a constant `k = (R/c) / τ₀`. This constant depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, which are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios:**\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Fraction of surviving particles, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Equation: `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Fraction of surviving particles, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` (to be determined)\n        *   Equation: `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n6.  **Solving for `γ₂`:**\n\n    We can solve for `γ₂` by first finding the value of `k` from Scenario 1 and then using it in Scenario 2. It's more direct to set up a ratio.\n\n    Let's take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n    *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`  => `-ln(3) = -k / 20` => `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`  => `-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂` => `k = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we can equate the two expressions for `k`:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Finally, we isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    We can now calculate the numerical value of `γ₂`:\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18`\n\n    The calculated value is approximately 54.2.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing our result with the given multiple-choice options:\n    A) 54\n    B) 68\n    C) 40\n    D) 28\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor `γ₂ ≈ 54.2` is closest to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
