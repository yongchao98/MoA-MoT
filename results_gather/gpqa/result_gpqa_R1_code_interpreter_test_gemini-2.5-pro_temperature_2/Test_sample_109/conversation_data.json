    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Conditions for a Star to be Observable by Both Spectrographs\n\nFor a star to be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, it must meet two criteria:\n1.  **Location (Declination):** The star must be visible from both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):** The star must be bright enough for both instruments.\n\n#### 1.1. Declination (Location) Criterion\n\nA telescope can only observe objects that rise above its horizon. This is determined by the observatory's latitude and the star's declination (DEC).\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South (-24.6°). It can observe stars with declinations south of `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately 19.8° North (+19.8°). It can observe stars with declinations north of `-(90° - 19.8°) = -70.2°`.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the common range:\n**-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n#### 1.2. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude) Criterion\n\nThe problem states the limiting apparent V magnitudes for each instrument:\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal):** Can observe stars brighter than V = 17 mag (i.e., `V < 17`).\n*   **HIRES (Keck):** Can observe stars brighter than V = 16 mag (i.e., `V < 16`).\n\nTo be observable by **both**, a star must meet the stricter condition, which is the limit of the HIRES spectrograph:\n**Apparent V magnitude < 16 mag**\n\n### 2. Formulas for Calculation\n\nWe may need to calculate the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) from the absolute magnitude (`M_V`), distance (`d`), and extinction (`A_V`). The formula is:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10 pc) + A_V`\nwhich is the same as:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\n\nThe extinction in the V-band (`A_V`) is calculated from the color excess (`E(B-V)`) using the given relation:\n`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`\n\n### 3. Analysis of Each Star\n\nWe will now check each star against the two criteria: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°** and **V < 16**.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_stars():\n    # Observatory and Instrument Parameters\n    keck_lat = 19.8\n    paranal_lat = -24.6\n    hires_mag_limit = 16.0\n\n    # Visibility range based on declination\n    dec_min = -(90.0 - keck_lat)\n    dec_max = 90.0 - abs(paranal_lat)\n    \n    # --- Star 1 ---\n    s1_dec = -75\n    s1_m_v = 15.5 + 5 * math.log10(10) - 5\n    s1_vis = dec_min < s1_dec < dec_max\n    s1_bright = s1_m_v < hires_mag_limit\n    print(f\"Star1: DEC={s1_dec}.

Observable by both (Mag)? {s4_bright}\")\n    \n    # --- Star 5 ---\n    s5_dec = 60\n    s5_m_v = 16.5 + 5 * math.log10(5) - 5\n    s5_vis = dec_min < s5_dec < dec_max\n    s5_bright = s5_m_v < hires_mag_limit\n    s5_final = s5_vis and s5_bright\n    print(f\"Star5: DEC={s5_dec}, Mag={s5_m_v:.2f}.

    "Here's the reasoning and step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Establishing Observational Criteria**\n\nTo be observable by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck, a star must satisfy two conditions:\n\n*   **Positional Criterion (Declination):** The star must be visible in the sky from both observatories. This depends on the latitude of the observatories and the declination (DEC) of the star.\n*   **Brightness Criterion (Apparent Magnitude):** The star must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments.\n\n#### **1.1. Positional Criterion (Declination Range)**\n\nA star is observable from a given latitude if its declination is within a certain range. We disregard pointing limits close to the horizon for simplicity.\n\n*   **Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately +19.8° N. It can observe objects north of a declination limit given by `Latitude - 90°`.\n    *   `DEC_limit_Keck` = +19.8° - 90° = -70.2°.\n    *   So, Keck can observe stars with **DEC > -70.2°**.\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S. It can observe objects south of a declination limit given by `Latitude + 90°`.\n    *   `DEC_limit_Paranal` = -24.6° + 90° = +65.4°.\n    *   So, Paranal can observe stars with **DEC < +65.4°**.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the common range:\n**-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n\n#### **1.2. Brightness Criterion (Apparent V-band Magnitude)**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than 17. So, `m_V < 17`.\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than 16. So, `m_V < 16`.\n\nTo be detected by **both**, a star must meet the stricter requirement, which is the one for HIRES.\n**Combined Brightness Criterion: `m_V` < 16**\n\n### **2. Relevant Formulas**\n\nIf the apparent magnitude is not given directly, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula, which relates apparent magnitude (`m_V`), absolute magnitude (`M_V`), distance (`d`), and extinction (`A_V`):\n\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10 pc)`\nWith extinction, this becomes:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10 pc) + A_V`\n\nWhere:\n*   `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   `A_V` is the interstellar extinction in the V-band. It's related to the color excess `E(B-V)` by `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n### **3. Evaluating Each Star**\n\nLet's check each star against our combined criteria: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°** and **`m_V` < 16**.\n\nI will use a python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define criteria\ndec_min = -70.2\ndec_max = 65.4\nmag_limit = 16.0\n\ndef calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, d_pc, A_V=0):\n    \"\"\"Calculates apparent magnitude.\"\"\"\n    # The term 5 * log10(d_pc / 10) can be written as 5 * log10(d_pc) - 5\n    return M_V + 5 * math.log10(d_pc) - 5 + A_V\n\ndef check_star(name, dec, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a star is observable by both.\"\"\"\n    # Check declination\n    dec_visible = dec_min < dec < dec_max\n\n    # Determine apparent magnitude\n    if 'm_V' in kwargs:\n        m_V = kwargs['m_V']\n    else:\n        M_V = kwargs['M_V']\n        d_pc = kwargs['d_pc']\n        A_V = kwargs.get('A_V', 0)\n        m_V = calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, d_pc, A_V)\n\n    # Check magnitude\n    mag_observable = m_V < mag_limit\n\n    is_observable = dec_visible and mag_observable\n    \n    print(f\"{name}:\")\n    print(f\"  - DEC = {dec}°.

    "Based on the analysis, a star must meet two conditions to be observed by both the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory and the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory:\n\n1.  **Visibility from both locations:** The star's declination (DEC) must be within the range visible from both observatories.\n    *   Keck (Latitude ~ +19.8° N) can see stars with DEC > -70.2°.\n    *   Paranal (Latitude ~ -24.6° S) can see stars with DEC < +65.4°.\n    *   Therefore, the combined visible range is **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n2.  **Brightness for both instruments:** The star must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments.\n    *   HIRES requires an apparent magnitude (`m_V`) brighter than 16.0 (`m_V` < 16.0).\n    *   ESPRESSO requires an apparent magnitude (`m_V`) brighter than 17.0 (`m_V` < 17.0).\n    *   To satisfy both, the star must meet the stricter HIRES limit: **`m_V` < 16.0**.\n\nThe evaluation of each star based on these criteria is as follows, confirmed by the script's output:\n\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required declination range. Thus, it is **not observable** by Keck.\n*   **Star2:** `m_V` = 16.5. This is fainter than the required brightness limit (`m_V` < 16.0). Thus, it is **not observable** by HIRES.\n*   **Star3:** DEC = 48° and `m_V` = 15.5. Both the declination and magnitude are within the required limits. Thus, it is **observable** by both.\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48° (observable). Its calculated apparent magnitude is `m_V` = 16.74, which is fainter than the limit of 16.0. Thus, it is **not observable** by HIRES.\n*   **Star5:** DEC = 60° (observable). Its calculated apparent magnitude is `m_V` = 14.99, which is brighter than the limit of 16.0. Thus, it is **observable** by both.\n\nThe stars that meet both criteria are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
