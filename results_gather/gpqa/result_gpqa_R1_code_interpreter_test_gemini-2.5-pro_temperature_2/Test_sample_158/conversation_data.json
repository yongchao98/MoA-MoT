    "Here's my reasoning process to determine the comoving distance of the quasar:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:** The problem describes a quasar spectrum with a peak at 790 nm and a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic astronomical signature known as the **Lyman-alpha break**. The intergalactic medium, composed mostly of hydrogen, is opaque to photons with enough energy to ionize hydrogen or excite its Lyman series transitions. The most prominent of these is the Lyman-alpha transition (from the ground state n=1 to n=2), which has a rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) of 121.567 nm (often approximated as 121.6 nm). The observed wavelength of this break ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The redshift `z` is the measure of this cosmological stretching of light. It's defined by the formula:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_{em}}$\n\n    Using the given values:\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs}$ = 790 nm\n    *   $\\lambda_{em}$ = 121.6 nm\n\n    We can calculate the redshift `z`:\n    $z = \\frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \\approx 6.497 - 1 = 5.497$\n    So, the quasar is at a redshift of approximately z = 5.5.\n\n3.  **Determine the Comoving Distance Formula:** The question asks for the comoving distance in a flat Lambda-CDM universe. The comoving distance ($D_C$) to an object at redshift `z` is given by the integral:\n    $D_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_{0}^{z} \\frac{dz'}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_{m,0}(1+z')^3 + \\Omega_{\\Lambda,0}(1+z')^{3(1+w)} }}$\n    \n    For dark energy as a cosmological constant, w = -1, and the expression for E(z') simplifies. Since the universe is flat ($\\Omega_{k,0} = 0$), the formula becomes:\n    $D_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_{0}^{z} \\frac{dz'}{E(z')}$\n    where $E(z') = \\sqrt{\\Omega_{m,0}(1+z')^3 + \\Omega_{\\Lambda,0}}$\n\n4.  **Set up for Numerical Calculation:** The integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be calculated numerically. I will use the given cosmological parameters:\n    *   $H_0$ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹ (Hubble Constant)\n    *   $\\Omega_{m,0}$ = 0.3 (Matter density parameter)\n    *   $\\Omega_{\\Lambda,0}$ = 0.7 (Dark energy density parameter)\n    *   $c$ ≈ 299792 km/s (Speed of light)\n    *   z ≈ 5.5 (Calculated redshift)\n\n    I will write a Python script to perform this numerical integration and calculate the final comoving distance in Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the redshift (z) from the observed Lyman-alpha break.\nlambda_obs_nm = 790.0  # Observed wavelength of the break in nm\nlambda_em_nm = 121.567  # Rest-frame wavelength of Lyman-alpha in nm\nz = (lambda_obs_nm / lambda_em_nm) - 1\n\n# Step 2: Define the cosmological parameters for the Lambda-CDM model.\nH0_kms_Mpc = 70.0  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nOmega_m0 = 0.3     # Matter density parameter\nOmega_L0 = 0.7     # Dark energy density parameter\nc_kms = 299792.458 # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Step 3: Define the function to be integrated.

    "My reasoning to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Observational Data:** The problem describes a quasar with a spectral peak at 790 nm and a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This is a tell-tale sign of the **Lyman-alpha forest** and the associated **Gunn-Peterson trough**. The peak corresponds to the Lyman-alpha emission line from the quasar, which has a rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) of approximately 121.6 nm (more precisely, 121.567 nm). The drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is due to the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen clouds in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The cosmological redshift `z` is determined by how much the wavelength of light has been stretched. The formula is:\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_{em}} - 1$\n    Using the given observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$ = 790 nm) and the rest-frame Lyman-alpha wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$ = 121.567 nm), we can calculate the quasar's redshift:\n    $z = \\frac{790 \\text{ nm}}{121.567 \\text{ nm}} - 1 \\approx 6.498 - 1 = 5.498$\n    So, the quasar is at a redshift of approximately z = 5.5.\n\n3.  **Determine the Required Calculation:** The question asks for the comoving distance ($D_C$). For a flat Lambda-CDM universe, the comoving distance is calculated by integrating over redshift. The formula is:\n    $D_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_{0}^{z} \\frac{dz'}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_{m,0}(1+z')^3 + \\Omega_{\\Lambda,0}}}$\n    where:\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   $H_0$ is the Hubble constant = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹.\n    *   $\\Omega_{m,0}$ is the matter density parameter = 0.3.\n    *   $\\Omega_{\\Lambda,0}$ is the dark energy density parameter = 0.7.\n    *   z is the redshift of the quasar, which we calculated to be ~5.5.\n\n4.  **Perform Numerical Integration with Python:** This integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be solved numerically.

This spectral signature is characteristic of the **Lyman-alpha line** and the associated **Lyman-alpha forest** or **Gunn-Peterson trough**. In high-redshift objects like quasars, the Lyman-alpha emission line (with a rest-frame wavelength, $\\lambda_{em}$, of 121.567 nm) is a prominent feature. The light at wavelengths shorter than this is heavily absorbed by the neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth. Therefore, the observed peak at 790 nm is the redshifted Lyman-alpha line.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The cosmological redshift, `z`, measures the stretching of light's wavelength due to the expansion of the universe.

    "My reasoning for solving this problem is based on identifying the physical phenomenon described and then applying the appropriate cosmological calculations.\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:** The problem describes a quasar spectrum with a distinct peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, and a sharp decrease in flux at wavelengths shorter than this peak. This is a classic signature of a high-redshift quasar. The peak is the Lyman-alpha ($\\text{Ly} \\alpha$) emission line, which is emitted at a rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) of 121.567 nanometers.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for arriving at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Feature:** The question describes a quasar spectrum with a prominent emission peak at 790 nm, followed by a sharp drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. In observational cosmology, this is the unmistakable signature of the Lyman-alpha ($\\text{Ly}\\alpha$) emission line from a high-redshift object. The drop in flux is caused by the absorption of photons by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (the Gunn-Peterson trough). The rest-frame wavelength of the $\\text{Ly}\\alpha$ line ($\\lambda_{em}$) is a well-known atomic transition, approximately 121.567 nm.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The cosmological redshift `z` is a measure of the stretching of light due to the expansion of the universe. It's calculated by comparing the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) with the wavelength at which the light was emitted ($\\lambda_{em}$):\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_{em}} - 1$\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    *   $\\lambda_{obs} = 790 \\text{ nm}$\n    *   $\\lambda_{em} = 121.567 \\text{ nm}$\n\n    $z = \\frac{790}{121.567} - 1 \\approx 6.498 - 1 = 5.498$\n\n    So, the quasar is at a redshift of approximately z = 5.5.\n\n3.  **Determine the Comoving Distance Formula:** The question asks for the comoving distance ($D_C$) in a flat Lambda-CDM universe. The standard formula for this calculation is:\n    $D_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_{0}^{z} \\frac{dz'}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_{m,0}(1+z')^3 + \\Omega_{\\Lambda,0}}}$\n\n    Where the problem gives us all the necessary parameters:\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) ≈ 299792.458 km/s\n    *   $H_0$ (Hubble constant) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   $\\Omega_{m,0}$ (matter density) = 0.3\n    *   $\\Omega_{\\Lambda,0}$ (dark energy density) = 0.7\n    *   $z$ (redshift) ≈ 5.498\n\n4.  **Perform Numerical Integration:** The integral in the comoving distance formula does not have a simple analytical solution and must be calculated numerically.
