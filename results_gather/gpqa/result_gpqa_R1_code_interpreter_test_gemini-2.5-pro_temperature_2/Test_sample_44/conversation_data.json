    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the three lowest states (ground state, first excited state, and second excited state) for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles confined within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the quantized energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), `m` is the mass of the particle, and `Ä§` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nThus, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nSo we have:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### **2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`. The spin can be either up ($m_s = +1/2$) or down ($m_s = -1/2$).\n\nThis implies that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to find the total energy of the system for the ground state and the first two excited states by distributing the four particles among the available energy levels.\n\n#### **Ground State (E_gs)**\n\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`.\n*   We place the next two particles in the second-lowest energy level, `n=2`.\n\nThe configuration is:\n*   2 particles in level n=1 (Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$)\n*   2 particles in level n=2 (Energy = $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$)\n\nTotal ground state energy:\n$E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### **First Excited State (E_1st)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available energy level, in the way that results in the smallest possible energy increase. This is typically achieved by moving a particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles at `n=1`, 2 particles at `n=2`.\n*   Highest occupied level: `n=2`. Lowest unoccupied level: `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   2 particles in level n=1 (Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$)\n*   1 particle in level n=2 (Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times 4E = 4E$)\n*   1 particle in level n=3 (Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times 9E = 9E$)\n\nTotal first excited state energy:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### **Second Excited State (E_2nd)**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n1.  **Move one particle from n=2 to n=3:** This gives the first excited state with energy **15E**. (Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3)\n2.  **Move one particle from n=1 to n=3:** This is another way to create an excited state.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n3.  **Move two particles from n=2 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the total second excited state energy is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nTo confirm this result, we can find these lowest energies by systematically generating configurations and calculating their energies.\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef find_lowest_energies(num_particles, max_levels=6):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the lowest energy states for a system of spin-1/2 fermions\n    in a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n    Args:\n        num_particles (int): The number of particles.\n        max_levels (int): The number of energy levels to consider for placing particles.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the unique, lowest energy values found.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Each level n has energy n^2 * E.

    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base unit of energy as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### **2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which makes them fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin orientation ($m_s = +1/2$ or $m_s = -1/2$). This means that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### **3. Calculation of State Energies**\n\nWe find the total energy of the system by summing the energies of all four particles. To find the energies of the different states, we arrange the four particles in the available energy levels.\n\n#### **Ground State (Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo achieve the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   We place the first two particles into the `n=1` level.\n*   We place the remaining two particles into the `n=2` level.\n\nThe configuration is:\n*   2 particles in level n=1: Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times 1E = 2E$\n*   2 particles in level n=2: Energy = $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\n$E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### **First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we need to create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   Ground state configuration has particles in `n=1` and `n=2`.\n*   Highest occupied level is `n=2`.\n*   Lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We promote one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   2 particles in level n=1: Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$\n*   1 particle in level n=2: Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 4E$\n*   1 particle in level n=3: Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 9E$\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st \\ excited} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the configuration with the next lowest energy. We consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n\n*   **Option 1:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives the first excited state with energy **15E**.\n*   **Option 2:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. This is a higher energy jump than Option 1.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = \\bf{18E}$.\n*   **Option 3:** Promote two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n*   **Option 4:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited configurations (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, etc.), the lowest is 15E (first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
