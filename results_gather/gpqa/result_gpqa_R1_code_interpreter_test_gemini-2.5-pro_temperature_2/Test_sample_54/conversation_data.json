    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 hydrogens. This chemical shift and multiplicity are characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl carbon, such as an acetate group (CH3-COO-). All four possible options contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n    *   **Total Proton Count:** Let's sum the integrations of all the signals: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular formula from the proton count:**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The formula is CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3. The number of hydrogens is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the NMR data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The formula is CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. The number of hydrogens is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10. This does **not** match the NMR data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Based on the total number of protons, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Assign the remaining signals to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3):**\n    *   The remaining signals are: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). These correspond to the three parts of the propenyl group.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet integrating to 3 hydrogens. This is the methyl group at the end of the chain (-CH=CH-**CH3**). It's a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These two signals correspond to the two vinylic protons on the double bond (-**CH**=**CH**-). The proton attached to the oxygen (-O-**CH**=) is more deshielded and will appear at a higher chemical shift (7.0 ppm). The other proton is less deshielded (5.5 ppm).\n        *   The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq) because this proton is coupled to the other vinylic proton (creating the doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet).\n        *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d) because this proton is only coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n\n4.  **Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans) using the coupling constant (J):**\n    *   The coupling constant between the two vinylic protons is given in the signal at 7.0 ppm as **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is dependent on their relative geometry:\n        *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The data indicates a propenyl acetate structure with a trans configuration on the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
