    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Part 1: Elucidating the structure of the starting material**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n3.  **Analyzing the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3), suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the -CH2- group. The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms that it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region are typical of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of protons are chemically non-equivalent and couple to each other.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n    *   **Assembling the fragments:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group as substituents. The complete structure is 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + CH2CHO + NH2 = C8H(4+2+1+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given molecular formula. The structure also accounts for the 5 degrees of unsaturation (4 for the ring, 1 for the C=O of the aldehyde).\n\n**Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the reaction sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde reacts to form 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n    *   Product (Intermediate A): [Cl-][N2+]-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n2.  **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    *   Adding water and gently warming the diazonium salt solution replaces the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a type of Sandmeyer reaction.\n    *   Product (Intermediate B): HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO, which is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n3.  **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   This step involves treating an aldehyde that has α-hydrogens (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde has two α-hydrogens on the CH2 group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This condition is perfect for an aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- ⇌ [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- (enolate) + H2O`\n        b.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde.\n        `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- → HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(O-)-CH(CHO)-C6H4-OH`\n        c.  Protonation of the resulting alkoxide by water gives the aldol *addition* product.\n        Aldol Adduct: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-C6H4-OH`\n        The IUPAC name for this adduct is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (A).\n        d.  Since the reaction is heated, the aldol adduct undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The hydroxyl group is on the β-carbon relative to the carbonyl group, and there is a hydrogen on the α-carbon. Elimination of this α-hydrogen and β-hydroxyl group forms an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        Dehydration Product: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO`\n        The IUPAC name for this final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Part 3: Identifying the final product**\n\n*   The final product is the result of the aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration).\n*   **Option A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n*   **Option B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the dehydrated aldol condensation product. The C=C double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the phenyl rings, making it the most stable and therefore the expected final product under heating.\n*   **Option C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This molecule only contains one phenyl ring, which is inconsistent with the dimerization that occurs during a self-aldol condensation.\n*   **Option D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This molecule is missing the hydroxyl groups that are formed in step 2 of the reaction sequence.\n\nThe correct final product is the stable, dehydrated product from the aldol condensation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
