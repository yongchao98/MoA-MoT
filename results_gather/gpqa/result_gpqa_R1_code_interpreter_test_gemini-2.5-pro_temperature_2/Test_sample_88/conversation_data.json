    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane is a rigid tricyclic alkane (tricyclo[3.3.1.1³,⁷]decane).\n*   **Reaction:** Heated to 240°C with excess KOH (a strong base).\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This strongly indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely a ketone, possibly in a strained ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 14 protons total. This corresponds to a molecular formula of C10H14O. The degrees of unsaturation for C10H14O is (10*2+2-14)/2 = 4. The adamantane skeleton has 3 rings (3 degrees of unsaturation), and the C=O group adds one more, totaling 4. This is consistent.\n*   **Reaction Identity:** The reaction of a dihalide with a strong base at high temperature to form a ketone suggests a complex rearrangement. A plausible pathway, although complex, is a Favorskii-type rearrangement that causes a ring contraction/rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton to a protoadamantane skeleton. A known product from such reactions is **protoadamantan-4-one**. While the provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 (especially the 4.79 ppm signal) is unusual and does not perfectly match simple expectations for this structure, the reaction type and the subsequent chemistry strongly support the formation of a ketone with a C10 framework. For now, we'll accept that Product 1 is a C10H14O ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is \"heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide\".\n*   **Interpretation:** Aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃, is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. The fact that the mixture is heated suggests that after the reduction, a subsequent elimination (dehydration) of the newly formed alcohol occurs. This is a common outcome when using Lewis acidic reagents like Al(O-iPr)₃ at elevated temperatures.\n*   **The sequence:**\n    1.  Product 1 (Ketone, C10H14O) is reduced to an intermediate alcohol (P2', C10H16O).\n    2.  P2' (Alcohol, C10H16O) is dehydrated to Product 2 (Alkene, C10H14).\n*   **Significance:** This sequence explains the next reaction step. The formation of an alkene (Product 2) is crucial.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a standard ozonolysis with reductive workup. This reaction cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (C=O). This confirms that Product 2 is indeed an alkene.\n*   **Plausible pathway for the carbon skeleton:** While the protoadamantane pathway is possible, it leads to ambiguous products. A simpler and common transformation in adamantane chemistry involves ring opening. Let's consider a pathway where the adamantane skeleton is retained until the final step.\n    1.  **Product 1 = Adamantan-2-one**. This forms from 1,3-dibromoadamantane via rearrangement/oxidation.\n    2.  **Intermediate P2' = Adamantan-2-ol**. From MPV reduction of adamantan-2-one.\n    3.  **Product 2 = Adamantene (Adamant-1-ene)**. From dehydration of adamantan-2-ol. The formation of this double bond at a bridgehead position violates Bredt's rule and means the alkene is extremely unstable. However, in the context of a multi-step problem, its formation as a transient intermediate that is immediately trapped by ozonolysis is plausible.\n    4.  **Ozonolysis of Adamantene (P2):** The C1=C2 double bond is cleaved. This opens up the adamantane cage.\n        *   The C1 atom (a bridgehead) becomes an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n        *   The C2 atom (a methylene bridge carbon) becomes a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n        *   The resulting molecular skeleton is a **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane** ring system.\n    5.  **Product 3 = 7-oxo-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde.** Let's trace the atoms to confirm the substitution pattern. Breaking the C1-C2 bond in adamantane does indeed lead to this product.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane substituted with a ketone at C7 and an aldehyde group (-CHO) at C3.\n*   **Symmetry:** The preferred dual-chair conformation of this molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (Cₛ) that passes through C3 (and its substituent), C1, C5, and C7 (and its substituent).\n*   **Task:** Identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable protons like -OH, but also likely the aldehyde -CHO proton as is common practice in such problems) and determine its coupling pattern.\n*   **Candidates for the most deshielded proton:**\n    *   **H3:** The proton on C3 of the ring. This proton is on the carbon that bears the aldehyde substituent (`-CH-CHO`). Protons on carbons bearing electronegative groups are deshielded.\n    *   **H1/H5:** The two bridgehead protons. These are deshielded due to their bridgehead nature and being β to two different carbonyl systems.\n    *   **H6/H8:** Protons alpha to the C7 ketone.\n*   **Analysis of Coupling Patterns:**\n    *   The bridgehead protons (H1/H5) would couple to at least 6 neighboring protons, resulting in a very complex multiplet not listed in the options.\n    *   The α-ketone protons (H6/H8) are methylene groups and would likely appear as complex multiplets (e.g., two sets of doublet of doublets).\n    *   The proton at C3 (H3) has a clear set of neighbors and its splitting pattern is easier to predict. It is a very plausible candidate for the \"most deshielded proton\" that has a clean splitting pattern.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H3:**\n    1.  H3 is on carbon C3.\n    2.  C3 is bonded to C2 and C4. Each of these carbons has two non-equivalent protons (endo/exo or axial/equatorial). So, H3 has **four** neighboring protons in total.\n    3.  Due to the Cₛ symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the corresponding two protons on C4.\n    4.  Let's consider the chair-like conformation. The bulky -CHO group will likely be in an equatorial position, making H3 axial. H3 will couple to the two adjacent axial protons (one on C2, one on C4) with a large coupling constant, J_ax-ax. It will also couple to the two adjacent equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C4) with a small coupling constant, J_ax-eq.\n    5.  Splitting by two equivalent protons (the axial ones) results in a **triplet**.\n    6.  Each peak of this triplet is then further split by two other equivalent protons (the equatorial ones), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    7.  Therefore, the theoretical splitting pattern for H3 is a **triplet of triplets (tt)**. This corresponds to option C. The other options are less likely:\n        *   (A) doublet of triplets: requires coupling to 1 and 2 protons (3 neighbors total).\n        *   (B) pentet: requires coupling to 4 protons with an identical coupling constant, which is unlikely given the rigid structure.\n        *   (D) triplet: requires coupling to only 2 protons.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The reaction sequence most plausibly leads to 7-oxo-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde. The most deshielded C-H proton with a simple splitting pattern is H3, which is expected to be a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
