    "*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The Â¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single proton (an alpha-proton). Since these peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals sum to one, it suggests the presence of two very similar, but chemically distinct, species in roughly a 1:1 ratio. The problem explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling. Enantiomers are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment and would produce a single set of peaks. Diastereomers, however, are chemically different and would be expected to have distinct NMR spectra, often with slightly different chemical shifts for corresponding protons. Therefore, the NMR data points towards a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) step separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity). The fact that two peaks are observed indicates the presence of two different compounds that can be separated by the LC column. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows that both of these separated compounds have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product. This means the two compounds are isomers of each other (same chemical formula, same mass).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They would not separate on a standard LC column and would show only one peak. They are also indistinguishable by standard NMR. This contradicts the observations.\n    *   **B) Precursor:** A precursor would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the same, expected mass. This contradicts the observation.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling':** This refers to an impurity where an amino acid has been added twice. This impurity would have a different, higher mass than the expected product. This contradicts the MS data.\n    *   **D) Diastereomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and are thus separable by standard (achiral) LC. They also have different chemical environments, making them distinguishable by NMR. However, they have the same molecular formula and mass, which is consistent with the MS data. This scenario could arise from epimerization at a stereocenter during synthesis or, very commonly in peptides, from restricted rotation around an amide bond (e.g., cis/trans isomers of a proline residue), creating atropisomers which are a type of diastereomer. This explanation perfectly aligns with all the provided data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of two separable peaks of identical mass by LC-MS, combined with two distinct sets of signals for a single proton in the NMR, is the classic signature of a sample containing a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
