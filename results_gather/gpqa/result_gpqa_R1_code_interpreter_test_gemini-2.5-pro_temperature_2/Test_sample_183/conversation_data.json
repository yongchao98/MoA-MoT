    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are located at adjacent positions (1, 2, and 3). This is a sterically congested arrangement, which suggests that a straightforward series of electrophilic aromatic substitutions might not be feasible. We need to carefully consider the directing effects of the substituents and the order of their introduction.\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options Strategically**\n\nThe problem asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which implies the chosen route should have good regiocontrol and avoid steps that produce hard-to-separate mixtures or have inherently low yields.\n\n*   **Final Substitution:** Let's consider the last step.\n    *   If nitration were last (on 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene), both -OEt and -tBu are o,p-directors. They would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. So, nitration is not the last step.\n    *   If Friedel-Crafts alkylation (-tBu) were last, the ring would likely have a -NO2 group, which deactivates the ring, making Friedel-Crafts reactions ineffective.\n    *   It is most likely that the ethoxy group is introduced late in the synthesis from a phenol precursor (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., using NaOH/EtBr). This means our penultimate target is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**3. The Challenge: Synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**\n\nTo make this phenol, a common method is the diazotization of the corresponding aniline followed by hydrolysis. So, we would need **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. The challenge is now to make this specific aniline. A 1,2,3 substitution pattern is difficult to achieve directly.\n\nLet's examine the proposed sequences. Options A, B, and C start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene. Option D starts with nitration.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D:** i) Nitration -> Nitrobenzene. ii) Reduction -> Aniline. iii) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tBuCl/AlCl3). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This makes Option D an impractical route.\n\n*   **Analysis of Options A, B, C:** They all start with tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Simple nitration (as in step C(ii)) would yield mostly the para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) and very little of the ortho isomer, which is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis if an ortho product is needed.\n\n**4. The Blocking Group Strategy**\n\nTo overcome the o,p-directing nature of the -tBu group and force substitution at a different position, a blocking group strategy is often employed. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent blocking group because it's a meta-director and can be easily removed (desulfonation) by heating with dilute acid.\n\nLet's follow this superior strategy:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Sulfonation:** The para position is sterically favored -> **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n3.  **Nitration:** Now, the incoming electrophile (-NO2) is directed by both groups. The -tBu group (at C4) directs ortho (to C2). The -SO3H group (at C1) directs meta (to C2). The effects are synergistic, leading cleanly to **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to steps (i), (ii), and (iii) of Option B, establishing it as the most chemically sound start to the synthesis.\n\n**5. Following Option B to Completion**\n\nLet's trace the rest of Option B.\n*   **Intermediate after step (iii):** 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Let's use a consistent numbering: SO3H at C1, NO2 at C2, tBu at C4.\n*   **Step (iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group -> **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**. (SO3H at C1, NH2 at C2, tBu at C4).\n*   **Step (v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group -> **[4-(tert-butyl)-1-sulfobenzene]-2-diazonium salt**. (SO3H at C1, N2+ at C2, tBu at C4).\n*   **Step (vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is an unusual step. It's not a standard Sandmeyer or hydrolysis reaction. Given its context, it must be a nitration reaction on the diazonium salt intermediate. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n    *   -tBu (at C4) is an o,p-director, activating positions 3 and 5.\n    *   -SO3H (at C1) is a m-director, directing towards positions 3 and 5.\n    *   -N2+ (at C2) is a strong m-director.\n    The combined effects of -tBu and -SO3H strongly favor substitution at C3 or C5. Let's assume nitration occurs at C3, which is sterically accessible.\n    *   **New Intermediate:** **[3-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-1-sulfobenzene]-2-diazonium salt**. We have now installed all the necessary functionalities in a 1,2,3,4 arrangement.\n*   **Step (vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium group is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group -> **3-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **Step (viii) dilute H2SO4:** Desulfonation removes the -SO3H group from position 1.\n    *   **Phenol Product:** The result is a phenol with OH at C2, NO2 at C3, and tBu at C4. Renumbering based on the principal functional group (phenol), we get **3-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   **Step (ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether.\n    *   **Final Product from this path:** **1-ethoxy-3-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**6. Final Check: Comparing the Derived Product and the Target Name**\n\n*   Derived Product: OEt at C1, NO2 at C2, tBu at C3.\n*   Target Molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which means OEt at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n\nThe derived product from sequence B is `1-ethoxy-3-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`, which is a constitutional isomer of the target `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. There is likely a typo in the problem's target molecule name. Given that Option B outlines a series of logical, albeit complex, synthetic steps that lead to a very closely related isomer with the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern, it is overwhelmingly the most plausible correct answer among the choices. The other options either involve low-yield steps or lead to products with incorrect substitution patterns. Therefore, assuming a typo in the target's name, Option B represents the most correct synthetic strategy.\n\nLet's re-verify the structure. Perhaps my nitration site guess for step vi was incorrect. But any alternative leads to a product even further from the target. The core logic of the blocking group strategy and subsequent functional group interconversions in option B is the most advanced and chemically sound approach presented.\n\n```python\n# This is a conceptual representation.

    "The user wants me to determine the correct multi-step synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. I will analyze each proposed sequence based on established principles of organic chemistry, particularly electrophilic aromatic substitution and directing effects.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n- **Benzene Ring**: The core structure.\n- **Substituents**:\n    1.  An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, *ortho-, para-*director.\n    2.  A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2. This is a weakly activating, *ortho-, para-*director. It is very bulky.\n    3.  A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta-*director.\n- **Substitution Pattern**: The groups are at positions 1, 2, and 3. This is a vicinal (adjacent) trisubstituted pattern, which can be challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires careful planning, often involving blocking groups.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Synthetic Options\n\nLet's evaluate the starting steps of each option.\n\n-   **Option D:** i) Nitration -> Nitrobenzene; ii) Reduction -> Aniline; iii) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. This sequence is fatally flawed. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) required for the Friedel-Crafts reaction. This forms a complex that deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation from occurring. Therefore, Option D is not a viable route.\n\n-   **Options A, B, and C:** All start with i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene. This is a standard and effective first step. The next step in A and C is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho-, para-*director. Due to the large steric bulk of the t-Bu group, nitration occurs preferentially at the *para* position, giving 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene as the major product. The desired ortho-nitro product (required for a 1,2,3-pattern) is formed in very low yield. A route that relies on isolating this minor isomer cannot be considered \"high-yield\". This makes options A and C unlikely to be correct.\n\n-   **Option B:** This option starts with a blocking group strategy, which is a classic technique for achieving \"unfavorable\" substitution patterns in high yield.\n    -   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Good)\n    -   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. This reaction, like nitration, is subject to steric hindrance. The bulky sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) will be directed to the *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This strategically \"blocks\" the most reactive position. (Excellent strategy)\n    -   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now we have two directing groups:\n        -   The `-tBu` group at C4 is an *o,p*-director, so it directs to C3 and C5.\n        -   The `-SO3H` group at C1 is an *m*-director, so it directs to C3 and C5.\n        The directing effects are synergistic, forcing nitration to occur cleanly at position C3 (or the equivalent C5). This gives **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield. This initial sequence is synthetically sound and powerful.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the Analysis of Option B\n\nLet's trace the rest of this promising sequence. The numbering is based on the standard benzene ring C1-C6.\n-   **Intermediate after (iii)**: `1-SO3H, 3-NO2, 4-tBu` on the ring.\n-   **iv) Fe/HCl**: This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group to an amine. -> **3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (`1-SO3H, 3-NH2, 4-tBu`).\n-   **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the primary aromatic amine to form a diazonium salt. -> **3-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (`1-SO3H, 3-N2+, 4-tBu`).\n-   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of the diazonium salt intermediate. Let's analyze the directing effects for the incoming nitro group:\n    -   `t-Bu` (at C4) directs *ortho* to C5.\n    -   `SO3H` (at C1) directs *meta* to C5.\n    -   `N2+` (at C3) is strongly deactivating and directs *meta* to C5.\n    All three existing groups direct the new nitro group to position C5. This provides outstanding regiocontrol. The product is **5-nitro-3-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (`1-SO3H, 3-N2+, 4-tBu, 5-NO2`).\n-   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Heating an aqueous acidic solution of a diazonium salt replaces the `-N2+` group with a hydroxyl `-OH` group. -> **5-nitro-3-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n-   **viii) dilute H2SO4**: Heating with dilute sulfuric acid is the standard method for *desulfonation*, removing the `-SO3H` blocking group. This leaves us with **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** (IUPAC name based on phenol as the parent, with -OH at C1, -tBu at C2, and -NO2 at C3).\n-   **ix) NaOH/EtBr**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydroxide deprotonates the phenol to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace the bromide from ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. The -OH is converted to an -OEt (ethoxy) group.\n-   **Final Product**: The final product is **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**. The question calls it `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, which is the same molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions described in option B is chemically sound, utilizes a sophisticated and high-yield blocking group strategy, and logically builds the complex target molecule step-by-step with excellent control over the position of each substituent. The other options contain synthetically unviable steps or would lead to very low yields of the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
