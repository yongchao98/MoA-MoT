    "**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and readily interconvert. A very common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (the α-carbon) to the carbonyl oxygen. For this to occur, there must be at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized α-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and single bonds, and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl carbons are themselves part of carbon-carbon double bonds (they are sp² hybridized).\n    *   Since there are no sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with hydrogen atoms, standard keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   This compound has a six-membered ring with carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- (methylene) groups.\n    *   These methylene carbons are sp³-hybridized and are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each one has two alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   These alpha-hydrogens are acidic and can easily move, allowing the compound to tautomerize. In fact, it exists predominantly in its aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   Let's look at the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The molecule is relatively flat and has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Molecules that possess a center of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
