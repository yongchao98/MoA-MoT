    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n    *   **Reactant:** Butan-2-one is a ketone (CH₃COCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Reagent:** NaCN provides the nucleophile, cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin. It has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitrile (-CN) group on the same carbon that was originally the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This addition breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃.\n        3.  To form the final stable product, the negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated (gain an H⁺) to become a neutral hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        4.  Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (an acid). The general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution is H₃O⁺. Using a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ provides the necessary H₃O⁺.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent 'A' is H₃O⁺. NaHSO₃ is incorrect as it would form a bisulfite addition product, not a cyanohydrin.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is called hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   **Reactant:** The starting material is a nitrile (specifically, an α-hydroxy nitrile).\n    *   **Product:** The final product is a carboxylic acid (specifically, an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Mechanism/Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating under strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions in the presence of water.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   B = CH₃COOH (acetic acid): This is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze the hydrolysis of a nitrile efficiently.\n        *   B = HCl (hydrochloric acid): This is a strong acid. Heating a nitrile with a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ is the standard procedure for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent 'B' must be a strong acid like HCl.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results.**\n    *   From Step 1, reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   From Step 2, reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
