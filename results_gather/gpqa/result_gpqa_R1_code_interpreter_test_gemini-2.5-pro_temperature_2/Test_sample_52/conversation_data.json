    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each analytical technique:\n\n*   **Compound Type:** It's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core of our molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. An ester group contains one C=O double bond.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. This would give two signals (likely doublets), each integrating to 2H. So we have 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very characteristic splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and by a group of three equivalent protons, like a methyl group (giving the quartet). A \"doublet\" arises from a proton split by a single adjacent proton. This pattern is the hallmark of a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. This group contains 2 vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** We have two non-equivalent methyl (-CH3) groups. One is accounted for by the propenyl group identified above. The second CH3 group must be part of the ester functionality. This could be a methyl ester (Ar-COOCH3) or an acetate group (Ar-O-COCH3).\n    *   **No -CH2- groups:** The absence of methylene signals is a crucial constraint, ruling out groups like ethyl, propyl, etc.\n\n### 2. Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nBased on the interpretation of the 1H NMR signals, we can sum the number of protons in the molecule:\n*   Aromatic protons: 4 H (from the two signals for the C6H4 ring)\n*   Vinyl protons: 2 H (from the two signals for the -CH=CH- part)\n*   Methyl protons: 2 signals correspond to two -CH3 groups, so 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n*   **Total Protons = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 H**\n\nThis means the correct chemical formula must have exactly 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's check the options:\nA) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect\nB) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**\nC) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect\nD) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**\n\nWe have narrowed down the possibilities to B and D.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula\n\nNow let's assemble the fragments we've identified to see which formula they produce.\n\n*   **Fragment 1:** para-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   **Fragment 2:** Propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`, which has the formula `C3H5`\n*   **Fragment 3:** An ester group with a methyl group. There are two possibilities, but both have the same formula:\n    *   Methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`, formula `C2H3O2`\n    *   Acetoxy group: `-O-CO-CH3`, formula `C2H3O2`\n\nLet's combine the formulas of these fragments to get the total molecular formula:\n*   Carbons: C6 (from ring) + C3 (from propenyl) + C2 (from ester part) = **C11**\n*   Hydrogens: H4 (from ring) + H5 (from propenyl) + H3 (from methyl ester part) = **H12**\n*   Oxygens: O2 (from ester group)\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis matches option B. The structure is fully consistent with all the provided data (including no -CH2- groups) and all atoms are accounted for. The two possible structures are Methyl 4-propenylbenzoate or 4-propenylphenyl acetate, both of which have the formula C11H12O2.\n\n### 4. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe DoU is a good way to cross-check our work.\n*   **From structure:** 1 Benzene Ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n*   **From formulas:** We can calculate the DoU for the remaining options B and D using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_string):\n    import re\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_string)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_string)\n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    return dou\n\nformula_B = \"C11H12O2\"\nformula_D = \"C12H12O2\"\n\ndou_B = calculate_dou(formula_B)\ndou_D = calculate_dou(formula_D)\n\nprint(f\"The required DoU from the structure is 6.\")\nprint(f\"DoU for {formula_B} (Option B): {dou_B}\")\nprint(f\"DoU for {formula_D} (Option D): {dou_D}\")\n\n```\n>>>\nThe required DoU from the structure is 6.\nDoU for C11H12O2 (Option B): 6.0\nDoU for C12H12O2 (Option D): 7.0\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that C11H12O2 has a DoU of 6, which perfectly matches the structural requirements. C12H12O2 has a DoU of 7, implying an extra ring or double bond that is not accounted for by the spectroscopic data. It is not possible to construct a C12H12O2 molecule that fits all the specific NMR signal constraints.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the analysis of the spectroscopic data, we can systematically determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of 1H NMR Data to Determine Hydrogen Count**\n\n*   **Aromatic-H:** There are two signals for the aromatic protons of a di-substituted benzene ring. This indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely *para* (1,4-), where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons. This accounts for a total of **4 aromatic protons**.\n*   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons, a doublet and a doublet of quartets. This is a very characteristic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl group (quartet), giving a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, giving a doublet. This fragment contains **2 vinyl protons**.\n*   **-CH3 Groups:** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n    *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**), accounting for **3 protons**.\n    *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality. This would be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH3), either of which contains **3 protons**.\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** Summing all the protons gives: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = **12 hydrogens**.\n\nBased on the hydrogen count, we can eliminate options A (C11H14O2) and C (C12H14O2). The correct formula must be either B (C11H12O2) or D (C12H12O2).\n\n**2. Assembling Molecular Fragments to Determine Carbon and Oxygen Count**\n\nLet's identify the fragments and sum their atoms to determine the complete formula.\n\n*   **Fragment 1:** Di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n*   **Fragment 2:** Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): **C3H5**\n*   **Fragment 3:** Ester group containing one methyl group (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3): **C2H3O2**\n*   **Fragment 4:** FTIR shows an ester group is present: **O2**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** C6 (from ring) + C3 (from propenyl) + C2 (from ester part) = **C11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** H4 (from ring) + H5 (from propenyl) + H3 (from ester part) = **H12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** O2 (from ester group)\n\nThe molecular formula derived by piecing together the structural information is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nWe can verify this conclusion by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).\n*   **DoU from structure:** The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (4 DoU), a C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 DoU), and a C=O double bond in the ester group (1 DoU). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n*   **DoU from formulas:** The DoU for a formula CxHyOz is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For C11H12O2 (Option B):** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches the structure.\n    *   **For C12H12O2 (Option D):** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This does not match the structure derived from the spectra.\n\nAll pieces of evidence consistently point to the chemical formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
