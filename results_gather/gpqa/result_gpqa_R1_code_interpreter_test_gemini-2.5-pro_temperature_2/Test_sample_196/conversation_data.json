    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the provided spectral data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded (downfield), broad singlet for one proton is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **δ 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and δ 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is the -COOH group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **δ 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** These signals represent the alkyl substituent on the benzene ring. Let's piece them together:\n        *   The signal at **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** is a triplet, which means this methyl group (-CH₃) is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   The signal at **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** is a multiplet, consistent with the methylene group of the ethyl fragment, which is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group and another proton.\n        *   The signal at **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** is a doublet, meaning this methyl group is adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   The signal at **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** is a multiplet corresponding to the methine proton. Its downfield shift indicates it's a benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). This proton is coupled to the protons of the adjacent methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm signal) and the adjacent methylene group (from the 1.7 ppm signal), hence it appears as a multiplet.\n        *   Combining these pieces gives the structure `Ar-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the assembled fragments (a para-disubstituted ring, a -COOH group, and a sec-butyl group), Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and the final product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a very strong reducing agent system. It is well-known for the complete reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes. Specifically, the -COOH group is reduced all the way to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will undergo the reduction of its carboxylic acid group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n    *   `4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid`  ---(Red P, HI)---> `1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene`\n\n**Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   The predicted final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n*   Let's check the options:\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect substituent (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
