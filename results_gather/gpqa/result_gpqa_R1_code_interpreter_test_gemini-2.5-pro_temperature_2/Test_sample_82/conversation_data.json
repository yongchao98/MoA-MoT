    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of pH at two different points in a titration process. First, we need to account for the initial dilution of the acetic acid. Then, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the 25% titration point (a buffer region) and the hydrolysis of the conjugate base for the equivalence point.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) = Initial Concentration × Initial Volume\n    Moles = 0.05 M × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 moles\n*   Total volume after adding water = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n*   Concentration of diluted acetic acid (Ca) = Moles / Total Volume\n    Ca = 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by reacting with NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH -> CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\nAt this point, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n*   [CH₃COO⁻] = 25%\n*   [CH₃COOH] = 75%\n\nWe use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\npH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa from Ka:\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\nNow, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(25%/75%)\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n*   pH ≈ 4.25\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\nFirst, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the 0.001 moles of acetic acid.\n*   Volume of NaOH (Vb) = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\nNow, we have a solution of sodium acetate. The total volume is:\n*   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n*   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\nThe concentration of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point is:\n*   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻), which makes the solution basic.\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nWe set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\nx² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02\nx² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.25 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option B.\nLet's verify with a precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Parameters ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nV_acid_initial = 0.020  # L (20.00 cm3)\nC_acid_initial = 0.05   # M\nV_water = 0.020         # L (20.00 cm3)\nC_naoh = 0.1            # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\n# Moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial\n# Total volume after dilution\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\n# Concentration of acetic acid after dilution\nC_acid_diluted = moles_acid / V_acid_diluted\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# At 25% titration, we are in the buffer region.\n# We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# The ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = initial moles of acid\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence\nV_naoh_eq = moles_acid / C_naoh\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_naoh_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nC_base_eq = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Solve for [OH-] from the hydrolysis equilibrium: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# The quadratic formula gives a more exact solution for x from: x^2 + Kb*x - Kb*C_base_eq = 0\na = 1\nb = Kb\nc = -Kb * C_base_eq\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nhydroxyl_conc = (-Kb + math.sqrt(Kb**2 - 4 * 1 * c)) / 2\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(hydroxyl_conc)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\n<<<B>>>",
