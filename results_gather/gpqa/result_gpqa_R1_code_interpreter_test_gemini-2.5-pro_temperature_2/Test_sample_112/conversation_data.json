    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) group. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and indicative fragment for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the `[COOH]⁺` ion.\n        *   Mass calculation: C (12) + O (16) + O (16) + H (1) = 45.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From the FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, we can confidently conclude that the unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (a C=C double bond).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`. Since there is no nitrogen, the formula simplifies to `DoU = C - H/2 + 1`.\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has one C=O double bond, which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n        *   An alkene group (C=C) has one C=C double bond, which accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, our target molecule must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For A) C6H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        *   This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid. There are no \"leftover\" degrees of unsaturation to account for the C=C double bond required by the FTIR and NMR data. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid).\n    *   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n        *   This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirements. One degree of unsaturation corresponds to the C=O of the carboxylic acid, and the second degree corresponds to the C=C of the alkene group. An example of such a compound is hexenoic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid and a degree of unsaturation of 2 to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\ndef calculate_dou(C, H, O, N=0):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n  return C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\n# Chemical formulas from the options\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": {\"C\": 6, \"H\": 12, \"O\": 2},\n    \"B\": {\"C\": 6, \"H\": 10, \"O\": 1},\n    \"C\": {\"C\": 6, \"H\": 10, \"O\": 2},\n    \"D\": {\"C\": 6, \"H\": 12, \"O\": 1}\n}\n\n# Requirements from the spectral data:\n# 1.

    "The user has asked for the identification of a chemical formula from a given list based on spectroscopic data. I will analyze the provided data step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Analysis\n\n1.  **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch typically ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹ for carboxylic acids).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The problem states there are \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens.\" Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragmentation peak for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 u.\n\n4.  **Synthesis of Evidence:**\n    *   The combined spectral data strongly suggest the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (a C=C double bond).\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10**O**) and D (C6H12**O**).\n    *   We are left with A) C6H12O2 and C) C6H10O2.\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for each. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - H/2 + 1` (for molecules with only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   1 degree of unsaturation for the C=O in the carboxylic acid.\n        *   1 degree of unsaturation for the C=C in the alkene.\n        *   Total required DoU = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This molecule has only one degree of unsaturation, which would be satisfied by the carboxylic acid's C=O group. There is no room for the C=C alkene group. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid). This is inconsistent with the data.\n        *   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates both the C=O from the carboxylic acid and the C=C from the alkene. This formula is consistent with all spectral data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the evidence (a carboxylic acid containing an alkene) is C6H10O2. The code execution output further confirms that C6H10O2 is the only option with 2 oxygen atoms and a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
