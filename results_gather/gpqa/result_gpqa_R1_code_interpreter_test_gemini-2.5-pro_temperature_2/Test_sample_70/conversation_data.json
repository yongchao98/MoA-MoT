    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Question:**\n    *   **System:** Five exoplanets (Planet_1 to Planet_5) around a single star.\n    *   **Orbits:** Circular.\n    *   **Orbital Resonance:** This is a key piece of information, implying a stable system where planets orbit the same central star.\n    *   **Orbital Period Ratios (P):** P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   **Albedo (A):** The albedo is the same for all planets. Albedo is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received.\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics - Equilibrium Temperature:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. It's determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated away as thermal radiation. The formula is:\n\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (for circular orbits, this is just the orbital radius).\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    I need to find the ratio `T_eq4 / T_eq2`. Let's write out the formula for each planet:\n\n    `T_eq4 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a4))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\n    Now, let's divide one by the other:\n\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a4))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    Many terms are constant for both planets and will cancel out:\n    *   `T_star` (same star)\n    *   `R_star` (same star)\n    *   `2` (a constant)\n    *   `(1 - A)^(1/4)` (the problem states the albedo `A` is the same)\n\n    After cancellation, the expression simplifies significantly:\n\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / a4)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)`\n\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n5.  **Connect Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    The problem gives us the ratio of orbital *periods*, not distances. I need to relate `a` and `P`. This is where **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion** comes in. The law states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis:\n\n    `P^2 ‚àù a^3`\n\n    For two planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as a ratio:\n\n    `(P2 / P4)^2 = (a2 / a3)^3`\n\n    I need to solve for `a2 / a4` to plug into my simplified temperature ratio formula.\n\n    `a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Finalize the Formula:**\n    Now I substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(P2 / P4)^(2/3)]^(1/2)`\n\n    Using the power rule for exponents `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`:\n\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\n    This is the final, elegant formula I need. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the ratio of the orbital periods.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    From the given period ratios (P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5), I can find the ratio P2/P4.\n\n    *   `P2` corresponds to the ratio value of `2`.\n    *   `P4` corresponds to the ratio value of `3.5`.\n\n    `P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n    Now, I plug this into the final formula:\n\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\n    I'll use a Python script to get a precise value for this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T4/T2)\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is given by the formula (P2 / P4)^(1/3),\n# where P2 and P4 are the orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4.\n# The given ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n# So, P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5 (in relative units).\n\n# Calculate the ratio P2 / P4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.8298717904097479\n</execute_code>\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately `0.82987`.

    "The user wants to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the temperature of the star.\n- $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance).\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 ($T_{eq4}$) and Planet_2 ($T_{eq2}$), we can set up the following equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_4})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A$ is constant), most terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{a_4})^{1/2}}{(\\frac{1}{a_2})^{1/2}} = (\\frac{a_2}{a_4})^{1/2}$\n\nThis means the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P) using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, we can write this as a ratio:\n$(\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^2 = (\\frac{a_2}{a_4})^3$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$ to use in our temperature ratio equation. We can rearrange Kepler's Law:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the formulas to get the final relationship**\n\nNow substitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_4}$ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = [(\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}]^{1/2}$\n\nUsing the rule of exponents $(x^m)^n = x^{mn}$:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\nThe ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n**4. Calculate the result**\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n- The relative period for Planet_2 ($P_2$) is 2.\n- The relative period for Planet_4 ($P_4$) is 3.5.\n\nNow, we plug these values into the formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n\nTo get a precise value, a simple calculation can be performed.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is given by the formula (P2 / P4)^(1/3),\n# where P2 and P4 are the orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4.\n# The given ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n# From the ratio, P2 corresponds to a value of 2, and P4 corresponds to a value of 3.5.\n\np2 = 2\np4 = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods.\nperiod_ratio = p2 / p4\n\n# The temperature ratio is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.8298717904097479\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.82987, which rounds to 0.83.

    "The reasoning and final conclusion remain the same despite the slight variation in the numerical output from the code execution, which is likely due to differences in floating-point arithmetic between computing environments. Both calculated values round to the same answer choice.\n\n**1. Establish the Physics Relationship**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on its distance from its star. The relationship is:\n$T_{eq} \\propto (\\frac{1}{a})^{1/2}$\nwhere $a$ is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\nTo find the ratio of temperatures for Planet 4 and Planet 2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{a_2}{a_4})^{1/2}$\n\n**2. Use Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law connects the orbital period ($P$) and the orbital distance ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$ or $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of orbital distances can be expressed in terms of the ratio of orbital periods:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine and Solve**\n\nSubstitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = [(\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{2/3}]^{1/2}$\n\nSimplifying the exponents gives the final formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n**4. Insert Values and Calculate**\n\nFrom the problem statement, the orbital periods have a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n*   The relative period for Planet 2 ($P_2$) = 2.\n*   The relative period for Planet 4 ($P_4$) = 3.5.\n\nPlug these into the formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n\nThe calculation from the code interpreter gave a value of approximately `0.8298`.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) ~0.57\n*   B) ~0.69\n*   C) ~0.83\n*   D) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value `0.8298` rounds to `0.83`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
