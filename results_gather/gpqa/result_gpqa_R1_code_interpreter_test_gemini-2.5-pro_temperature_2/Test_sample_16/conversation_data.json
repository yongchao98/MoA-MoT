    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex in solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibrium.**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The formation of the complex is represented by the following reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Write the expression for the formation constant ($K_f$).**\n    The problem provides the formation constant for this complex, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$ (or $K_f$), which is $5 \\times 10^{10}$. The expression for $K_f$ is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    The problem statement \"we assume that the pH is ideal\" implies that we can use this absolute formation constant directly, without needing to correct for the protonation of EDTA. This is equivalent to assuming that the pH is high enough so that essentially all uncomplexed EDTA is in the fully deprotonated $Y^{4-}$ form.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a stoichiometric solution of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. Let's consider the dissociation of this complex to find the equilibrium concentrations.\n    Reaction: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    *   **Initial:**\n        *   $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02$ M\n        *   $[Ca^{2+}] = 0$ M\n        *   $[Y^{4-}] = 0$ M\n    *   **Change:** Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n        *   $[[CaY]^{2-}] = -x$\n        *   $[Ca^{2+}] = +x$\n        *   $[Y^{4-}] = +x$\n    *   **Equilibrium:**\n        *   $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n        *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n        *   $[Y^{4-}] = x$\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the $K_f$ expression and solve for x.**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply an approximation.**\n    Because the formation constant $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore approximate $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate x.**\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Now, take the square root to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    This value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of $[Ca^{2+}]$. Let's verify our initial approximation: $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ is indeed much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\n    Let's perform the calculation precisely.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    K_f = 5e10\n    C0 = 0.02\n\n    # Using the approximation x = sqrt(C0 / K_f)\n    x_squared = C0 / K_f\n    x = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n    print(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n    ```\n\n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    6.32e-07\n    ```\n    The calculation confirms that $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    A) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\n    Our calculated concentration of $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
