    "This problem requires calculating the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given organic molecule. The calculation involves using bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of the elements.\n\nThe general formula for the enthalpy of formation from bond energies is:\nΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants in their standard state)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n\n**1. Determine the molecular formula and structure of the compound.**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   Let's count the carbon atoms (C):\n    *   (CH3)2C=: 1 central C + 2 C in the methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   =CH-: 1 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in the methyl group = 2 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH=: 1 C\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 1 central C + 2 C in the methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C\n\n*   Let's count the hydrogen atoms (H):\n    *   (CH3)2C=: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   =CH-: 1 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH=: 1 H\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22\n\n**2. Calculate the total enthalpy required for the atomization of reactants.**\n\nThis is the energy needed to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize hydrogen: This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds. 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ.\n\n**3. Determine the number and type of bonds in the product molecule.**\n\nFrom the structure determined in step 1, let's count the bonds.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The count must equal the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **Carbon-Carbon bonds**: For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of C-C bonds (single, double, or triple) is (Number of C atoms) - 1. So, 12 - 1 = 11 carbon-carbon bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds**: The structure clearly shows two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -CH**=C**(CH3)2. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds**: Total C-C bonds - C=C bonds = 11 - 2 = 9 C-C single bonds.\n\nSummary of bonds in C12H22:\n*   22 C-H bonds\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n\n**4. Calculate the total bond energy of the product.**\n\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the gaseous product is formed from its constituent gaseous atoms.\nTotal Bond Energy = (No. of C-H bonds * BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds * BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds * BE(C=C))\nTotal Bond Energy = (22 * 400 kJ/mol) + (9 * 200 kJ/mol) + (2 * 300 kJ/mol)\nTotal Bond Energy = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n**5. Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f).**\n\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of the product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**6. Check the units of the options.**\n\nThe options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. We must check which one matches. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol.\n*   Option A is 1900 kJ/g, which has the correct numerical value but incorrect units.\n*   Option B is 67.4 kJ/mol.\n*   Option C is 11200 kJ/mol, which is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   Option D is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nLet's convert our answer to kJ/g and see if it matches option D. To do this, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = 12 * (12.0 g/mol) + 22 * (1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nΔH_f (in kJ/g) = ΔH_f (in kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (in g/mol)\nΔH_f (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.445 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches Option D.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations precisely.\n\n```python\n# Given data\ndH_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100       # kJ/mol\nBE_CC = 200       # kJ/mol\nBE_C_double_C = 300 # kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400       # kJ/mol\n\n# Step 1: Molecular formula\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Step 2: Enthalpy of atomization of reactants\n# Reactants: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g)\nenthalpy_atom_reactants = (num_C * dH_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * BE_HH)\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Total bond energy of the product\n# Bonds in C12H22: 22 C-H, 9 C-C, 2 C=C\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\nnum_C_double_C_bonds = 2\nbond_energy_product = (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH) + (num_CC_bonds * BE_CC) + (num_C_double_C_bonds * BE_C_double_C)\n\n# Step 5: Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndH_f_mol = enthalpy_atom_reactants - bond_energy_product\n\n# Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using C=12, H=1)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\ndH_f_gram = dH_f_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {dH_f_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {dH_f_gram}\")\n```\n<<<\n11.44 kJ/g",
    "**1. Determine the molecular formula and structure of the compound.**\n\nThe given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, we determine its molecular formula by counting the carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH()) + 1 (in -CH(CH3)) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (=C()) + 2 (in C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (in =CH-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in -CH()) + 3 (in -CH(CH3)) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in =CH-) + 6 (in C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\nLet's recount to be sure. A better way:\n(CH3)2C= -> C=3, H=6\nCH- -> C=1, H=1\nCH2- -> C=1, H=2\nCH(CH3)- -> C=2, H=4\nCH2- -> C=1, H=2\nCH= -> C=1, H=1\nC(CH3)2 -> C=3, H=6\nTotal C = 3+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12\nTotal H = 6+1+2+4+2+1+6 = 22\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Write the formation reaction.**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**3. Calculate the total enthalpy for atomization of reactants.**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants to form individual gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 gas (break 11 moles of H-H bonds): 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   Total energy input (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**4. Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule.**\n\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the gaseous product molecule is formed from its constituent gaseous atoms. First, we need to count the number of each type of bond in C12H22.\n*   **C=C bonds:** From the structure, there are two double bonds. (Number of C=C bonds = 2)\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic molecule with 'n' carbon atoms, the total number of carbon-carbon links (single, double, triple) is n-1. Here n=12, so there are 11 total C-C links. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining are single bonds. Number of C-C single bonds = 11 - 2 = 9.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n\nNow, calculate the total bond energy:\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Total bond energy of product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f).**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released on forming the product bonds.\nΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of the product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Compare with the given options and check units.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Options A and D are given in kJ/g, so we must convert our result to these units.\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of C12H22. Using atomic masses C≈12 g/mol and H≈1 g/mol:\n    Molar Mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Now, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (ΔH_f in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
