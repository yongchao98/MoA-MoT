    "This problem requires an understanding of molecular genetics, specifically how different types of mutations affect gene function. The goal is to identify the mutation most likely to inactivate a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. A mutation that completely inactivates the gene is often called a \"knockout\" mutation. The most effective knockout mutations are those that cause the most significant disruption to the protein's structure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the intact gene and each mutant:\n\n1.  **Intact Gene Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... TGA-3’`\n    *   The sequence starts with `ATG`, the universal start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). Translation begins here.\n    *   The sequence ends with `TGA`, which is a stop codon, terminating protein synthesis.\n    *   The first few amino acids coded by the intact gene are: Met (ATG), Phe (TTT), Leu (CTC), Ala (GCT), Gly (GGT), Thr (ACT).\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Mutants:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Change: `...TTT CTC...` -> `...TTC TAC...`\n        *   This represents two point mutations (substitutions).\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** and has no effect on the amino acid sequence.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it's not guaranteed to inactivate it. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Change: `...CTC...` -> `...TAA...`\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely after only two amino acids (Met-Phe) have been joined.\n        *   Impact: This results in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is a very strong candidate for a gene knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Change: An insertion of one `T` nucleotide after the second codon (`TTT`).\n        *   Original codons: `ATG | TTT | CTC | GCT | ...`\n        *   Mutant codons: `ATG | TTT | TTA | CGC | ...`\n        *   This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion shifts the \"reading frame\" for all subsequent codons. The new amino acid sequence (Met-Phe-Leu-Arg...) will be completely different from the original, and a premature stop codon is likely to be encountered downstream.\n        *   Impact: This will produce a radically different and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is also a very strong candidate for a gene knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Change: Deletion of the `GGT` codon (Glycine) and a missense mutation in the `CTC` codon.\n        *   Original: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr)\n        *   Mutant: `...TAC GCT ACT...` (Tyr-Ala-Thr).\n        *   This is an in-frame deletion of one amino acid and a simultaneous missense mutation of another. While this alters the protein, it's less disruptive than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation because the reading frame for the rest of the gene remains intact. The protein might still retain some function.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense mutation) and Mutant 3 (frameshift mutation) are highly likely to completely inactivate the gene. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 occurs at the 3rd codon, guaranteeing an extremely short and non-functional protein (only two amino acids long). A frameshift mutation is also highly effective, but theoretically, it could result in a protein that retains some function if a new in-frame start codon is present downstream, or if the resulting garbage sequence doesn't immediately lead to a stop codon. Given the options, the introduction of a stop codon so early in the sequence (Mutant 2) is the most definitive and surefire way to eliminate the synthesis of the target protein. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
