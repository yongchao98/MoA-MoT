    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This fraction is often denoted as α₂.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nThe solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions, which form a series of complexes. The species containing cobalt are:\n*   Free Co²⁺ ion\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] (the species of interest)\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β).\n\n**2. The Formula for Species Distribution**\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a particular complex [MLₙ] is given by the formula:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴)\n\nwhere:\n*   αₙ is the fraction of the complex with 'n' ligands.\n*   βₙ is the overall stability constant for the complex [MLₙ]. We define β₀ = 1 for the free metal ion.\n*   [L] is the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand (in this case, [SCN⁻]).\n\n**3. Identify Given Values**\n\n*   Total Cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe are looking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂], so we need to calculate α₂.\n\n**4. Check the Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration added is much larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.1 M >> 0.01 M). The maximum amount of SCN⁻ that could be bound by the cobalt is 4 * c(Co) = 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M. Since this is less than the total SCN⁻ available, and not a negligible fraction, the free SCN⁻ concentration at equilibrium will be slightly less than 0.1 M. However, in many textbook and exam problems of this type, when the ligand is in significant excess, it is a standard and acceptable approximation to assume the free ligand concentration at equilibrium is equal to its initial total concentration.\nSo, we will use [SCN⁻] = [L] = 0.1 M for our calculation.\n\n**5. Calculate the Terms**\n\nWe need to calculate each term in the denominator of the α₂ formula:\n\n*   Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n*   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[L]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[L]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[L]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[L]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n**6. Calculate α₂**\n\nNow, we can assemble the formula for α₂:\n\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator\nNumerator = β₂[L]² = 0.4\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**7. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction α₂ by 100:\n\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe following Python code confirms this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given thiocyanate concentration (used as free ligand concentration)\nL = 0.1 # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * L^n) / (1 + beta1*L + beta2*L^2 + beta3*L^3 + beta4*L^4)\n\n# We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.\n# Calculate the numerator for alpha_2\nnumerator_2 = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator (which is the sum of all species contributions)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator_2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_of_CoSCN2 = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_of_CoSCN2)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we need to calculate its mole fraction (α₂) relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Definition of Species and Constants:**\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are: Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\nThe formation of these complexes from Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ is described by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nFor the free Co²⁺ ion, we can consider its formation constant β₀ = 1.\n\n**2. Mole Fraction Formula:**\nThe fraction (αₙ) of any specific complex [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ * [SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (Σ βᵢ * [SCN⁻]ⁱ) for i = 0 to 4\nαₙ = (βₙ * [SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are asked to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂], so we need to calculate α₂.\n\n**3. Ligand Concentration Approximation:**\nThe total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, while the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. Since the thiocyanate is in a 10-fold excess compared to cobalt, we can make the common approximation that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, [SCN⁻], is nearly equal to its initial total concentration.\nSo, we will use [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nFirst, we calculate the denominator of the fraction, which is the sum of the relative amounts of each species:\nDenominator (Σ) = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nΣ = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nΣ = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nΣ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nΣ = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator term for the [Co(SCN)₂] complex (n=2):\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
