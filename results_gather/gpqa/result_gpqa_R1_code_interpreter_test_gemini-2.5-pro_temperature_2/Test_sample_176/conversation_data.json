    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $R$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio $L_1/L_2$, we can divide the luminosity equation for Star_1 by the equation for Star_2:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    *   This gives us: $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1/T_2)^4$.\n    *   The information about the mass ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is not directly needed for the luminosity calculation based on radius and temperature, so it is extra information.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    *   The temperature of a star is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max}$). This relationship is described by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $\\lambda_{max} * T = b$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n        This can be rewritten as $T = b / \\lambda_{max}$.\n        Therefore, the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of their peak emission wavelengths:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{max,2} / \\lambda_{max,1}$.\n    *   Crucially, $\\lambda_{max}$ in this formula is the wavelength as emitted by the star (the rest-frame wavelength). However, the problem gives us the *observed* peak wavelength, which is affected by the star's motion relative to us (Doppler effect).\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:**\n    *   The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) by the Doppler shift formula. For speeds much less than the speed of light ($c$), the approximation is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{rest} * (1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity.\n    *   The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars:\n        $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$\n    *   Substituting the Doppler formula:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,1} * (1 + v_{r,1}/c) = \\lambda_{rest,2} * (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   We can rearrange this to find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,2} / \\lambda_{rest,1} = (1 + v_{r,1}/c) / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   Since we established that $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest,2} / \\lambda_{rest,1}$, we have:\n        $T_1/T_2 = (1 + v_{r,1}/c) / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   We are given the radial velocities: $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s.\n    *   The speed of light, $c$, is approximately 299792.458 km/s.\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        $T_1/T_2 = (1 + 0/c) / (1 + 700/c) = 1 / (1 + 700 / 299792.458)$\n        $T_1/T_2 \\approx 1 / (1 + 0.00233496)$\n        $T_1/T_2 \\approx 0.9976735$\n    *   This result shows that Star_2 is slightly hotter than Star_1. This is because Star_2 is moving away from us, so its light is redshifted. For its observed peak wavelength to be the same as Star_1's, its actual emitted peak wavelength must be shorter, which implies a higher temperature.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation of the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   Now substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation from step 4:\n        $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n        $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 * (0.9976735)^4$\n        $L_1/L_2 \\approx 2.25 * 0.99074$\n        $L_1/L_2 \\approx 2.229165$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 2.23. This matches option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nvr1 = 0  # km/s\nvr2 = 700  # km/s\nc = 299792.458  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2)\n# T1/T2 = (1 + vr1/c) / (1 + vr2/c)\nT1_over_T2 = (1 + vr1 / c) / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio (L1/L2)\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL1_over_L2 = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\nprint(L1_over_L2)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the formula:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $R$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find $L_1/L_2$. We can write this as:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information about Radius:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    (Note: The information about the mass is extra information and not needed for this calculation.)\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):** To find this ratio, we use the information about the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature ($T$) to the wavelength of its peak emission in its rest frame ($\\lambda_{rest}$). The formula is $\\lambda_{rest} \\times T = b$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   From this, we can say that $T$ is inversely proportional to $\\lambda_{rest}$. Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest, 2} / \\lambda_{rest, 1}$\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:** The observed peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is not the same as the rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) because the stars are moving. The relationship is given by the Doppler shift formula. For radial velocity $v_r$ and speed of light $c$, the formula is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\times (1 + v_r/c)$\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars:\n    $\\lambda_{obs, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, 2}$\n    Therefore:\n    $\\lambda_{rest, 1} \\times (1 + v_{r,1}/c) = \\lambda_{rest, 2} \\times (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Rest Wavelengths:** We can rearrange the above equation to find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $\\lambda_{rest, 2} / \\lambda_{rest, 1} = (1 + v_{r,1}/c) / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n8.  **Substitute Values to find Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   We are given: $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s.\n    *   The speed of light $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s.\n    *   The temperature ratio is:\n        $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest, 2} / \\lambda_{rest, 1} = (1 + 0/c) / (1 + 700/c) = 1 / (1 + 700/c)$\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\times [1 / (1 + 700/c)]^4$\n    To get a precise value, we can use the provided Python code interpreter.\n\n10. **Code Execution:** The Python script accurately performs this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nR1_R2_ratio = 1.5\nv_r1_kms = 0\nv_r2_kms = 700\n\n# Constants\nc_kms = 299792.458 # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the rest-frame peak wavelengths, which is equal to the temperature ratio T1/T2.\n# T1/T2 = lambda_rest_2 / lambda_rest_1 = (1 + v_r1/c) / (1 + v_r2/c)\nT1_T2_ratio = (1 + v_r1_kms / c_kms) / (1 + v_r2_kms / c_kms)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the luminosity ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann law relation.\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_R2_ratio**2) * (T1_T2_ratio**4)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\nThe output of the code is `2.229107561148499`.\n\n11. **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.23\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.35\n    D) ~2.32\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
