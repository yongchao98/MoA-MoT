    "This problem describes an elimination-addition reaction of an aryl halide, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate**: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n*   **Reagent**: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a classic example of nucleophilic aromatic substitution via a benzyne mechanism. The reaction involves two main stages: elimination to form a benzyne intermediate, followed by the addition of a nucleophile.\n\n### Step 2: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n1.  **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n**Pathway A: Abstraction of a proton (H⁺) from C6**\n*   The amide ion removes the H⁺ from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n*   The resulting carbanion at C6 then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n*   This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is called **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n \n\n**Pathway B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D⁺) from C2**\n*   The amide ion can also remove the D⁺ from C2. Although this is slower than H⁺ abstraction, it is still a possible reaction pathway.\n*   The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion from C1.\n*   This forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed in this process, the resulting benzyne is unlabeled **benzyne** (C₆H₄). The abstracted deuteron becomes part of the solvent/reagent system (e.g., forming NH₂D).\n\n \n\nSince the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider the products derived from both benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 3: Addition - Formation of Final Products\nThe nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which attacks one of the carbons of the triple bond in the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n**Products from 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\nThe 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6:\n*   **Attack at C1**: The NH₂ group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 yields a final product with the NH₂ group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n*   **Attack at C6**: The NH₂ group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a final product with the NH₂ group at C6 and the D at C2. The relative positions of NH₂ and D are 1 and 3, respectively. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n\nSo, the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate leads to **two** distinct organic products.\n\n \n\n**Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\nThe benzyne intermediate (C₆H₄) is symmetrical. Attack by NH₂⁻ on either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2), followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n*   **Attack at C1 or C2**: Both scenarios result in the formation of **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n\nSo, the unlabeled benzyne intermediate leads to **one** organic product.\n\n \n\n### Conclusion\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline**\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline**\n3.  **Aniline**\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThe correct answer is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
