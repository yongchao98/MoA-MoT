    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts:\na) The relative speed (`v_rel`) between them.\nb) The total energy (`E_total`) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n- Astronaut 1: Mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c` (in the positive x-direction).\n- Astronaut 2: Mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c` (in the positive x-direction).\n- `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (`v_rel`):**\nSince both astronauts are moving along the same line (the x-axis), we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. The relative speed of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 is given by:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3 * c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857... c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (`E_total`):**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula `E = γ * m0 * c^2`, where `m0` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`.\n\n**a) Calculate the energy of Astronaut 1 (`E1`):**\n- Rest mass `m0_1 = 2m`\n- Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n- First, find the Lorentz factor `γ1`:\n  `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n  `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n  `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n  `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n  `γ1 = 1.25`\n- Now, calculate `E1`:\n  `E1 = γ1 * m0_1 * c^2`\n  `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n  `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**b) Calculate the energy of Astronaut 2 (`E2`):**\n- Rest mass `m0_2 = 3m`\n- Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n- First, find the Lorentz factor `γ2`:\n  `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n  `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n  `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n- Now, calculate `E2`:\n  `E2 = γ2 * m0_2 * c^2`\n  `E2 = (1 / sqrt(0.75)) * (3m) * c^2`\n\n**c) Calculate the Total Energy (`E_total`):**\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + (1 / sqrt(0.75)) * 3mc^2`\n`E_total = (2.5 + 3 / sqrt(0.75)) * mc^2`\n\nTo get a numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Relative speed\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\nv_rel_coeff = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# Astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nE1_coeff = gamma1 * 2  # in units of mc^2\n\n# Astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nE2_coeff = gamma2 * 3  # in units of mc^2\n\n# Total energy\nE_total_coeff = E1_coeff + E2_coeff\n\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel_coeff:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {E_total_coeff:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n\nAfter running the above calculations, we get the following results:\n- The relative speed `v_rel` is approximately `0.14c`.\n- The total energy `E` is approximately `5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\n- `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n- `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires us to use the formulas for relativistic velocity subtraction and total relativistic energy.\n\n**Part 1: Relative Speed (`v_rel`)**\n\nSince both astronauts are traveling in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula to find their relative speed. The formula is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2 / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3 * c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**Part 2: Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two individual astronauts. The formula for the total energy of a single particle is:\n`E = γ * m₀ * c²`\nwhere `m₀` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is given by `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E₁):**\n*   Rest mass, `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity, `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₁`:\n    `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E₁`:\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E₂):**\n*   Rest mass, `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity, `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E₂`:\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy (E_total):**\n*   The total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n    `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n    `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc² = 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOur calculated values are `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`.
