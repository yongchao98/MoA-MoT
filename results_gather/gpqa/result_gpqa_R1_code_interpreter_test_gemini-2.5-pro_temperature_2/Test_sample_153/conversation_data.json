    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound, calculated using the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. Its relative intensity is 32% of the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom. The natural abundance of the ³⁷Cl isotope is approximately 32.5% that of the ³⁵Cl isotope. Thus, the molecule has the formula `R-³⁵Cl` (MW = 156) and `R-³⁷Cl` (MW = 158), where R represents the rest of the molecule.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (forming dimers) causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is characteristic of an acidic proton, specifically a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with) confirms this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0-8.5 ppm):** There are two signals in this region, which is typical for protons attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal represents two chemically equivalent protons that have one neighboring proton, hence they appear as a doublet.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal represents another pair of chemically equivalent protons, which also have one neighboring proton.\n*   **The overall NMR pattern (one singlet and two doublets for 4 aromatic protons) is a distinctive fingerprint for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.** The two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are equivalent to the two on the other, resulting in two sets of equivalent protons.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weight of the proposed structures to see if they match the mass spectrum data. We'll use the atomic masses C=12, H=1, O=16, and ³⁵Cl=35.\n```python\ndef calculate_mw(formula):\n    atomic_mass = {'C': 12, 'H': 1, 'O': 16, 'Cl': 35}\n    mw = 0\n    import re\n    elements = re.findall('([A-Z][a-z]?)(\\d*)', formula)\n    for element, count in elements:\n        count = int(count) if count else 1\n        mw += atomic_mass[element] * count\n    return mw\n\n# Formulas for the options\nformulas = {\n    \"A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid\": \"C7H5ClO2\",\n    \"B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid\": \"C7H5ClO2\",\n    \"C) Phenyl chloroformate\": \"C7H5ClO2\",\n    \"D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\": \"C7H5ClO2\"\n}\n\nfor name, formula in formulas.items():\n    print(f\"Molecular weight of {name} ({formula}): {calculate_mw(formula)}\")\n```\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** The formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. MW = (7*12) + (5*1) + (1*35) + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. It contains one chlorine atom. This matches the MS data perfectly.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which would show a very broad O-H (3500-2700 cm⁻¹) and a C=O (~1700 cm⁻¹) stretch. This matches the IR data.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (~10-13 ppm) and is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which gives the characteristic pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This matches the NMR data perfectly. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded (8.02 ppm) than those next to the -Cl group (7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   Matches MS and IR data. However, the *ortho*-substitution would lead to four distinct aromatic proton signals with complex splitting, which contradicts the simple pattern seen in the ¹H NMR.\n\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:**\n    *   Matches MS data. However, it is an acid formate, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. It also lacks a carboxylic acid proton, contradicting the ¹H NMR peak at 11.0 ppm.\n\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:**\n    *   Matches MS data. However, it is a phenol and an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. The IR and NMR data for this structure (phenolic OH, aldehydic H, and a different aromatic splitting pattern for only 3 aromatic protons) do not match the provided spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The analysis of the spectral data is as follows:\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak at **m/z = 156** represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes. The provided Python script output confirms that all four potential options (4-chlorobenzoic acid, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, phenyl chloroformate, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have a molecular weight of 156 (using ³⁵Cl).\n*   The M+2 peak at **m/z = 158** has an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. This M⁺/(M+2) intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom**.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   The very **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n*   The **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid**.\n*   Based on the IR data, we can eliminate options C and D, as they are not carboxylic acids. Phenyl chloroformate (C) lacks the O-H group, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) has phenolic and aldehydic groups, which would produce different IR spectra.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   The signal at **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)** is in the typical chemical shift range for a **carboxylic acid proton**. This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   The aromatic region shows a highly symmetrical pattern: a **doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and another **doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H)**. This pattern, with two signals each representing two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**.\n*   Comparing the remaining options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern: two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) benzene ring. This substitution pattern would result in four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex spectrum, which does not match the data provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll three pieces of spectroscopic evidence are consistent only with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
