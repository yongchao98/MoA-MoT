    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The description points to maleic anhydride. A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This data perfectly matches maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄). It has four methyl groups on the sp² carbons of the cyclopentadiene ring and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n    *   Because the dienophile can approach the cyclic diene from two different faces, two stereoisomeric products are formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The problem states a major and a minor product are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored and therefore the major product. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored, minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the products is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton NMR Signals and Structures:**\n    Let's identify the key proton groups in the product and estimate their chemical shifts:\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (sp³). These will be a 6H singlet, upfield. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**. (`Me_bridgehead`)\n        *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond carbons (sp²). These will be another 6H singlet, further downfield. Let's assign this to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**. (`Me_vinylic`)\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:**\n        *   Two equivalent protons on the carbons that came from the maleic anhydride double bond. Due to symmetry and having no adjacent H's (the neighboring bridgehead carbons have methyl groups), these will be a singlet. Their shift will be influenced by the bicyclic structure and proximity to carbonyl groups. The given **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is a reasonable assignment. (`H_anhydride`)\n    *   **Bridge Protons:**\n        *   The two protons on the C7 bridge (from the CH₂ of the diene) are diastereotopic. They will appear as two separate signals, likely coupled to each other (forming an AB quartet or two doublets). The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these protons (`H_C7`).\n\n4.  **Use the NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The crucial piece of information is: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the **minor product**.\"\n    *   This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Analyze Spatial Proximity in Endo vs. Exo Isomers:**\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (\"syn\") as the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (\"anti\") to the C7 bridge.\n\n    Let's evaluate the proton pairs from the options based on their proximity in the two isomers:\n\n    *   **A) `Me_bridgehead` (~1 ppm) & `H_C7` (~1.5 ppm):** The bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are bonded to the bridge carbon (C7). The protons on these methyl groups and the bridge will be close in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. This interaction is not unique to one isomer.\n\n    *   **B) `Me_bridgehead` (~1 ppm) & `Me_vinylic` (~1.7 ppm):** The carbons carrying these methyl groups are adjacent in the product's framework. The protons will be close in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. This interaction is not unique.\n\n    *   **D) `Me_vinylic` (~1.7 ppm) & `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm):**\n        *   In the *exo* isomer, the anhydride protons are on the same face as the double bond and thus close to the vinylic methyl groups. An NOE would be expected.\n        *   In the *endo* isomer, the anhydride protons are on the opposite face, far from the vinylic methyls. No NOE would be expected.\n        *   This predicts an NOE in the minor product, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\n    *   **C) `H_C7` (~1.5 ppm) & `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm):**\n        *   Let's distinguish the two C7 protons: H_syn (pointing towards the C=C double bond) and H_anti (pointing away). In the *endo* isomer, the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. The H_anti proton points \"downward\" and toward the endo face, bringing it very close to the `H_anhydride` protons. A strong NOE is expected.\n        *   In the *exo* isomer, the anhydride ring is on the opposite face. The `H_anhydride` protons are now very far from the H_anti proton on the C7 bridge. The NOE would be absent or very weak.\n        *   This prediction matches the experimental observation perfectly: a cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe cross-peak that is unique to the major product connects the anhydride protons with one of the C7 bridge protons. Option C describes exactly this interaction with plausible chemical shifts.\n\n<<<C>>>"
