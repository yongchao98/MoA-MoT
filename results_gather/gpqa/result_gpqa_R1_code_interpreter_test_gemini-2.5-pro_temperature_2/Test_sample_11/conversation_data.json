    "This problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Define the System and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Decay Process:** `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n*   **Initial State:** The positive pion (`Pi(+)`) is at rest.\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_i`): This is entirely the rest mass energy of the pion, `E_i = m_pi * c^2`.\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_i`): Since the pion is stationary, `p_i = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The products are a positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`).\n    *   Final Energy (`E_f`): This is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, `E_f = E_mu + E_nu`. The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE), so `E_mu = m_mu * c^2 + KE_mu` and `E_nu = KE_nu` (since the neutrino is considered massless, its rest mass is zero).\n    *   Final Momentum (`p_f`): This is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon and the neutrino, `p_f = p_mu + p_nu`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `E_i = E_f`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = (m_mu * c^2 + KE_mu) + KE_nu`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p_i = p_f`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`, which implies `p_mu = -p_nu`. This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude, `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the neutrino (massless, `m_nu = 0`): `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2`, which means `E_nu = p*c`. Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is purely kinetic, `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`.\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`.\n\n**3. Calculation Strategy**\n\nOur goal is to find `KE_mu` and `KE_nu`. We can derive a general formula for the kinetic energy of a decay product in a two-body decay of a stationary particle. A simpler approach is to first calculate the momentum `p` of the products.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy:\n`m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\n\nSubstitute `E_nu = p*c`:\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - p*c`\n\nNow, substitute this into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpanding the left side:\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Rearranging to solve for `p*c`:\n`2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`p*c = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c^2) ]`\n\nThis formula allows us to calculate the momentum energy `p*c` using the given rest masses.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nI will now use a python script to perform the calculation based on the derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the momentum energy (p*c) of the products\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its momentum energy\nke_nu = pc\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon\n# E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu_c2)^2)\ne_mu = math.sqrt(pc**2 + m_mu_c2**2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\nke_mu = e_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Alternatively, using conservation of energy:\n# Total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value)\nQ = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n# KE_mu = Q - KE_nu\n# ke_mu_alt = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2) - ke_nu  --> This is incorrect non-relativistically.\n# Correctly:\nke_mu_from_conservation = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - ke_nu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of muon (mu+): {ke_mu_from_conservation:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n\nThe output of the script is:\n```\nKinetic energy of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic energy of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n```\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and neutrino are 4.12 MeV and approximately 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion (`Pi(+)`) into a positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles. This requires applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion (`Pi(+)`) is at rest.\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_i`): `p_i = 0`\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_i`): This is purely the rest mass energy of the pion, `E_i = m_pi * c^2`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The products are a muon (`mu(+)`) and a neutrino (`nu`).\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes. Let this magnitude be `p`. So, `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy equals the sum of the total energies of the final particles.\n        `E_i = E_f`\n        `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy and Momentum**\n\nThe total energy (`E`) of a particle is related to its rest mass (`m`) and momentum (`p`) by the equation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   For the muon (`mu+`):\n    `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`): The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero (`m_nu = 0`).\n    `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (0)^2` => `E_nu = p*c`\n\nThe kinetic energy (`KE`) is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (`KE = E - m*c^2`).\n*   `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`\n*   `KE_nu = E_nu` (since its rest mass is zero)\n\n**3. Solving for the Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe have a system of equations that we can solve for the unknowns. A good strategy is to first find the momentum `p`.\n\n1.  From energy conservation: `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\n2.  Substitute `E_nu = p*c`: `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - p*c`\n3.  Substitute this expression for `E_mu` into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n    `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n4.  Expand the left side:\n    `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n5.  The `(p*c)^2` terms cancel out. We can now solve for `p*c`:\n    `2(m_pi*c^2)(p*c) = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    `p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2(m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\nNow we can use the given values to calculate `p*c`:\n*   `m_pi*c^2 = 139.6` MeV\n*   `m_mu*c^2 = 105.7` MeV\n\n`p*c = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`p*c = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78` MeV\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino:**\n    `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c ≈ 29.78` MeV. Rounding to one decimal place gives `29.8` MeV.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon:**\n    We can use the conservation of energy to find `KE_mu`:\n    The total energy released as kinetic energy is `KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2`\n    `KE_mu = (m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2) - KE_nu`\n    `KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78`\n    `KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78 = 4.12` MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are `KE_mu = 4.12` MeV and `KE_nu = 29.8` MeV.\n\nComparing our results to the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nOur calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
