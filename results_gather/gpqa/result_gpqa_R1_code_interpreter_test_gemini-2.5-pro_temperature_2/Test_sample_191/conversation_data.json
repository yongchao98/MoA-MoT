    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral spherical conductor of radius $R$. Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity of radius $r$. The center of the cavity is displaced by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at an external point P, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   Negative charges will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge and will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   Positive charges will be repelled and will move to the farthest point possible, which is the outer surface of the large spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Applying Gauss's Law inside the Conductor:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the bulk of the conducting material must be zero. Let's imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   Since the electric field ($\\vec{E}$) is zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface, the electric flux ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$) through it is also zero.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total charge enclosed by this surface must be zero ($Q_{enclosed} = 0$).\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner wall of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    *   Therefore, $+q + q_{inner} = 0$, which implies $q_{inner} = -q$.\n    *   So, a total charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged (neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has been induced on the inner surface, to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear elsewhere. As there can be no net charge within the bulk of the conductor, this charge $+q$ must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** The conducting material effectively isolates the region outside the conductor from the charges inside the cavity. The combination of the charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner wall is completely shielded by the conductor. As a result, the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the positions of the cavity or the charge $+q$ within it.\n\n6.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** We have a net charge of $+q$ on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius $R$. In the absence of any other external electric fields, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the External Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** The electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field that would be produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   This charge is distributed on a sphere whose center is the center of the conductor.\n    *   The point P is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{Q_{total\\_on\\_outer\\_surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The distances $r$, $s$, $l$, and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors. They would be relevant for finding the electric field *inside* the cavity, but for any point *outside* the conductor, the field is solely determined by the charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. The correct expression for the electric field magnitude at point P is $\\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
