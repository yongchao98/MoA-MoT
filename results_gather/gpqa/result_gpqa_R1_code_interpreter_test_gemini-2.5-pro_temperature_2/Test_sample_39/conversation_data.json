    "This is a common colloquialism in a chemistry lab, particularly in organic chemistry where purification is a constant challenge. Let's break down the context and the options.\n\n1.  **The Context:** The chemist is expressing frustration after a process in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A major part of synthetic chemistry is not just making the desired compound, but also purifying it from leftover starting materials, byproducts, and reagents. The most common technique for this purification is **chromatography** (like column chromatography or thin-layer chromatography - TLC).\n\n2.  **The Phrase:** \"On top of each other\" is a visual metaphor.\n    *   In **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)**, which is used to monitor reactions and find suitable separation conditions, compounds appear as spots. If two compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means their spots have moved the same distance up the plate, indicating they are inseparable under those conditions.\n    *   In **Column Chromatography**, the goal is to have different compounds travel down the column at different speeds and be collected in separate flasks (fractions). If they are \"on top of each other,\" it means they are moving at the same speed and eluting from the column at the same time, making separation impossible.\n\n3.  **The Underlying Principle:** Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents called the eluent). This partitioning is governed almost entirely by the **polarity** of the compounds.\n    *   Polar compounds stick more strongly to the polar stationary phase (like silica) and move slower.\n    *   Nonpolar compounds stick less and are carried along more quickly by the mobile phase.\n    *   If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will interact with the stationary and mobile phases in almost the same way. Consequently, they will move at the same speed, resulting in them being \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate or co-eluting from a column.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Similar optical rotations: Optical rotation is a property related to a molecule's chirality. While enantiomers (which have equal and opposite optical rotations) are notoriously difficult to separate on standard columns, this is a very specific case. The phrase is much more generally used to describe the difficulty in separating any two compounds, not just chiral ones. Therefore, this is not the *most likely* meaning.\n    *   **B) Similar polarities:** This is the direct cause of poor separation in chromatography, the most common purification technique in this context. If the polarities are similar, the compounds behave identically during the separation process. This directly explains why they would be \"on top of each other.\" This is the most likely answer.\n    *   C) Non-covalent bonding: While molecules do interact, this is not what the phrase refers to. A chemist would more likely describe that situation by saying \"they're complexing\" or \"they're sticking together.\" The phrase \"on top of each other\" specifically points to a chromatographic separation problem.\n    *   D) Similar boiling points: This would be a problem for purification by **distillation**. While distillation is a valid technique, chromatography is far more common for routine purification in a modern synthetic lab, and the visual metaphor \"on top of each other\" fits chromatography (spots on a plate, overlapping elution profiles) much better than it fits distillation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemist is almost certainly referring to a failed chromatographic separation, which occurs when the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
