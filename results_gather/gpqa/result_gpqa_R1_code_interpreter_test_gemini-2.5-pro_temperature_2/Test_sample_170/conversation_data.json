    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically the bromination of various substituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting materials in order of increasing yield (weight fraction) of the para-monobromo product. Since the molecular weights of the different isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given product are identical, the weight fraction is directly proportional to the mole fraction or percentage yield.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:**\n    We need to classify the substituents on the benzene ring based on their electronic effects and directing influence.\n    *   **Activating, Ortho, Para-directing:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making the ortho and para positions more reactive. They lead to high yields of ortho and para isomers.\n        *   -CH3 (in Toluene, **1**)\n        *   -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, **5**)\n    *   **Deactivating, Ortho, Para-directing:** Halogens are electron-withdrawing via induction (deactivating the ring) but electron-donating via resonance (directing to ortho and para positions).\n        *   -Cl (in Chlorobenzene, **3**)\n    *   **Deactivating, Meta-directing:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, primarily from the ortho and para positions, making the meta position the most reactive (or least deactivated). They will produce very low yields of the para isomer.\n        *   -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, **4**)\n        *   -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, **2**)\n        *   -COOH (in Benzoic acid, **6**)\n\n3.  **Order the Substances into Two Main Groups:**\n    The meta-directing compounds will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while the ortho, para-directing compounds will have the highest.\n    *   **Low para-yield group:** 2, 4, 6\n    *   **High para-yield group:** 1, 3, 5\n\n4.  **Order the Meta-Directing Substituents (Low Yield Group):**\n    For meta-directing groups, the para-yield will be extremely small. The yield is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength; the stronger the deactivator, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and the lower the para-yield.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength for these groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   Typical para-isomer yields in similar electrophilic substitutions (like nitration) are: Nitrobenzene (~0.3%), Benzoic acid (~1-2%), Ethyl benzoate (~3-8%). This confirms the order **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n5.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substituents (High Yield Group):**\n    For these compounds, the main product will be a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The fraction of the para-isomer depends on steric and electronic factors that influence the para/ortho ratio.\n    *   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** This is the smallest of the three groups. Steric hindrance at the ortho position is moderate. Bromination gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products (e.g., ~67% para).\n    *   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position much more accessible to the incoming large bromine electrophile. This results in a very high para-isomer yield (e.g., ~90% or more). So, para yield (1) < para yield (5).\n    *   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** Chlorine is deactivating by induction (-I effect) and o,p-directing by resonance (+R effect). The strong -I effect deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance from the chlorine atom, strongly favors para substitution. Bromination of chlorobenzene gives a high yield of the para isomer (e.g., ~89%).\n\n    **Comparing the para-yields:**\n    *   Actual data for **bromination** suggests the order: Toluene (1, ~67%) < Chlorobenzene (3, ~89%) < Ethylbenzene (5, ~90%). This gives the sequence **1 < 3 < 5**.\n    *   However, none of the answer choices combine this sequence with the correct meta-director order (4 < 6 < 2).\n    *   Let's consider the trend for **nitration**, which is a similar reaction often used to teach these principles. For nitration, the smaller NO2+ electrophile is less sensitive to sterics. The order of para yield is: Toluene (1, ~38%) < Ethylbenzene (5, ~49%) < Chlorobenzene (3, ~70%). This gives the sequence **1 < 5 < 3**. This difference is due to the balance of steric and electronic effects changing with the electrophile.\n\n6.  **Combine and Finalize the Order:**\n    Let's assemble the full sequence using the meta-director order (4 < 6 < 2) and the ortho,para-director order from nitration trends (1 < 5 < 3), as this matches one of the options.\n    *   The low-yield group comes first: **4 < 6 < 2**\n    *   The high-yield group comes after: **... < 1 < 5 < 3**\n    *   Combining these gives the final order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    This derived sequence `4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3` matches option C perfectly. It seems the question, while stating bromination, expects the answer based on the trends commonly taught using nitration data.\n\nFinal proposed order: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
