    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the derivation and reasoning.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   **Observer:** The potentials are measured at a position `r` and time `t`.\n*   **Retardation:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light `c`. The field measured at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time `t_r`, called the retarded time, from a position `s(t_r)`.\n*   **Retarded Time Condition:** The time difference `t - t_r` must be equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the source position `s(t_r)` to the field point `r`. This gives the implicit equation for `t_r`:\n    `t - t_r = |r - s(t_r)| / c`\n\n### 2. Key Vectors and Variables\n\n*   **Retarded position of the charge:** `s_ret = s(t_r)`.\n*   **Velocity of the charge at retarded time:** `v = ds/dt` evaluated at `t_r`.\n*   **Vector from source to observer:** `d = r - s(t_r)`.\n*   **Distance from source to observer:** `d = |d| = |r - s(t_r)|`.\n*   The retarded time condition can be rewritten as `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a single moving point charge, derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_r') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_r') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge, the charge and current densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them is a standard, but non-trivial, procedure in electrodynamics. The complication arises because the retarded time `t_r' = t - |r - r'|/c` depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration accounts for a Doppler-like effect: the volume of the charge element appears compressed or expanded from the observer's point of view, depending on whether the charge is moving towards or away from the observer.\n\nThis effect introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The effective distance is not just `d`, but `d(1 - v·d̂/c)`, where `d̂ = d/d` is the unit vector from the source to the observer.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - d · v / c)`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v) / (d - d · v / c)`\n\n### 4. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's manipulate the derived formulas to match the format of the options.\nThe denominator is `d - d · v / c`. We can rewrite this by finding a common denominator `c`:\n`d - d · v / c = (dc - d · v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / [(dc - d · v) / c] = (1 / 4πε₀) * (qc) / (dc - d · v)`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v) / [(dc - d · v) / c] = (μ₀ / 4π) * (qc v) / (dc - d · v)`\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option A.\n\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n*   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`\n\n### 5. Analysis of Other Options\n\n*   **Options B and C:** These use `V = q / (4πε₀ r)`, which is the electrostatic potential for a stationary charge at the origin (`r` is distance from the origin). This is incorrect for a moving charge and ignores retardation.\n*   **Option D:** This option has a `+` sign in the denominator `(dc + d · v)`. This would correspond to the advanced potentials, which are typically discarded as they violate causality (effects preceding causes). The physical solutions are the retarded potentials, which have a `-` sign.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
