    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental relationship between star counts and volume.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This is a crucial assumption. It means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere in space. The number of stars (`N`) within a certain volume (`V`) is therefore directly proportional to that volume:\n    `N = ρ * V`\n\n2.  **Relate the volume to the distance.**\n    Let's consider the stars within a sphere of radius `d` from the observer. The volume of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    Therefore, the total number of stars up to a distance `d`, let's call it `N(<d)`, is:\n    `N(<d) = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    This shows that `N(<d)` is proportional to `d^3`.\n\n3.  **Introduce the concept of parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The standard definition is `plx = 1/d` (where `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs).\n    From this, we can express the distance `d` in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax.**\n    We want to find the number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. A star with parallax `p > plx` has a distance `d_star < d`, where `d = 1/plx`. So, the number of stars with parallax greater than `plx`, let's call it `N(>plx)`, is equivalent to the number of stars within a distance `d = 1/plx`.\n    We can substitute `d = 1/plx` into our expression for `N(<d)`:\n    `N(>plx) ∝ d^3 = (1/plx)^3 = plx^(-3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This is the differential count, which mathematically is the derivative of `N` with respect to `plx`, i.e., `dN/d(plx)`. This quantity tells us the density of stars in a small interval of parallax.\n    Let's differentiate our expression for `N(>plx)` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ d/d(plx) [plx^(-3)]`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx [x^n] = n*x^(n-1)`), we get:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ -3 * plx^(-3-1) = -3 * plx^(-4)`\n\n6.  **Interpret the final result.**\n    The rate `dN/d(plx)` is proportional to `plx^(-4)`. The negative sign simply indicates that the cumulative number of stars `N(>plx)` decreases as the parallax threshold `plx` increases (which makes sense, as we are looking into a smaller volume of space). The actual number of stars found *in* a specific parallax interval (a density) must be positive. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to the magnitude:\n    `|dN/d(plx)| ∝ plx^(-4) = 1/plx^4`\n\n    This means the number of stars per unit parallax interval is strongly concentrated at small parallaxes (large distances) and falls off very rapidly as parallax increases (as we look at stars closer to us).\n\n7.  **Match with the given options.**\n    The derived relationship is `~ 1/plx^4`. This corresponds to option D.\n\nA) ~ 1/plx^2\nB) ~ 1/plx^1\nC) ~ 1/plx^3\nD) ~ 1/plx^4\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
