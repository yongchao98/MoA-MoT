    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns described.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these splitting patterns mean based on the \"n+1\" rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 neighboring protons (like a CH₂ group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 neighboring protons (like a CH₃ group).\n\nFor complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple non-equivalent sets of protons.\n*   A proton that gives a **`dtq`** signal is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one set with **1 proton**, one set with **2 protons**, and one set with **3 protons**.\n*   A proton that gives a **`dtt`** signal is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one set with **1 proton**, one set with **2 protons**, and another, non-equivalent set of **2 protons**.\n\n### Step 3: Parse the Chemical Structures and Analyze their Expected 1H NMR Spectra\n\nWe will systematically analyze the structure of each option to see if its protons can produce the observed `dtq` and `dtt` signals. We assume a left-to-right reading of the condensed formulas to determine the carbon backbone.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\nParsing this formula leads to a chemically impossible structure (`CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`), as the terminal methyl group would require the adjacent carbon to have five bonds. Therefore, this option is likely incorrect or contains a typo. We will proceed with the other, more clearly defined structures.\n\n**B) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n*   **Structure:** Parsing from left to right gives `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n                 CH₃(f)    CH₃(g)\n                 |         |\n          HOOC - CH₂(b) - C(H)(c) - C(H)(d) - CH₃(e)\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Proton Hc:** This proton is on carbon C3. Its neighbors are:\n        *   The two protons on C2 (`Hb`, a CH₂ group) → triplet (t)\n        *   The one proton on C4 (`Hd`, a CH group) → doublet (d)\n        *   The three protons on the methyl substituent (`Hf`, a CH₃ group) → quartet (q)\n    *   Thus, proton **Hc** has neighbors (2H, 1H, 3H) and would produce a **`dtq`** signal.\n    *   **Does it have a `dtt`?** For a `dtt`, we need neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H). No proton in this molecule has two different CH₂ groups as neighbors. Proton `Hd` is coupled to `Hc`(1H), `He`(3H), and `Hg`(3H), giving a `dqq`. Therefore, this molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** Parsing gives `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n                 CH₃(f)   CH₃(g)\n                 |        |\n      CH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-C(H)(c)--C(H)(b)-COOH\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Proton Hc:** This proton is on carbon C3. Its neighbors are:\n        *   The one proton on C2 (`Hb`, a CH group) → doublet (d)\n        *   The two protons on C4 (`Hd`, a CH₂ group) → triplet (t)\n        *   The three protons on the methyl substituent (`Hf`, a CH₃ group) → quartet (q)\n    *   Thus, proton **Hc** has neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) and would produce a **`dtq`** signal.\n    *   **Does it have a `dtt`?** No proton in this molecule has the required (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbor combination. Therefore, this molecule also has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n*   **Structure:** Parsing gives `CH₃-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n               CH₂(c)-CH₃(d)  <-- Et on C2\n               |\n        HOOC - C(H)(a) -- C(H)(b) -- CH₂(i) -- CH₃(j)\n                          |\n                          CH₂(e)-CH₃(f)  <-- Et on C3\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Proton Hb:** This proton is on carbon C3. Its neighbors are:\n        *   The one proton on C2 (`Ha`, a CH group) → doublet (d)\n        *   The two protons on C4 (`Hi`, a CH₂ group) → triplet (t)\n        *   The two protons on the C3-ethyl substituent (`He`, a CH₂ group) → triplet (t)\n    *   Thus, proton **Hb** has neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) and would produce a **`dtt`** (doublet of triplets of triplets) signal. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   **Does it have a `dtq`?** Now we need to find a proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H). Let's examine proton **Ha**.\n        *   **Proton Ha:** This proton is on C2. Its direct vicinal neighbors are:\n            *   The one proton on C3 (`Hb`) → doublet (d)\n            *   The two protons of its own ethyl group (`Hc`) → triplet (t)\n        *   This combination (`Hb` and `Hc`) would only give a `dt` (doublet of triplets). However, long-range (4-bond) coupling is possible. The `Ha` proton can also couple to the three `Hd` protons through the `Ha-C2-Cc-Cd-Hd` path. If this coupling is resolved, `Ha` is also coupled to:\n            *   The three protons of the methyl part of the C2-ethyl group (`Hd`) → quartet (q)\n    *   If we include this plausible long-range coupling, proton **Ha** has neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) and would produce a **`dtq`** signal.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nMolecule **C (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)** is the only candidate that can produce both the characteristic `dtt` signal (from proton Hb) and the `dtq` signal (from proton Ha, with the inclusion of a common long-range coupling). The other viable structures (B and D) can explain the `dtq` signal but cannot produce the highly specific `dtt` signal.\n\nThus, the unknown compound is **CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
