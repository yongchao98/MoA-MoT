    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\nThis melting point is characteristic of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, B is most likely D₂O.\n\n**Step 2: Use the identity of B to deduce other substances and reactions.**\n*   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests that G is a deuterated compound that loses D₂O upon heating, such as a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₓ) or a deuterated hydrate (Salt·xD₂O). For example, 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n*   This implies that Deuterium (D) is heavily involved in the reaction. This fits with the initial clue that Substance X \"incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\" Deuterium (D or ²H) is a heavier stable isotope of Hydrogen.\n*   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G.\n*   Since D₂O is a product derived from G, it's highly probable that the reactants contained deuterium. A common and simple liquid reactant would be heavy water itself. Let's assume Liquid Y is D₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine possible gases formed from a reaction involving deuterium.\n*   Let's test Deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the condition (number of protons = number of neutrons).\n*   Other simple molecules like HD would have 2 protons and 1 neutron, which doesn't fit.\n*   Therefore, Gas W is very likely D₂.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Substance X**\nWe need a substance X that reacts violently with Y (D₂O) to produce W (D₂) and a precipitate G (which can be heated to form D₂O). X must also be a known organic reagent (or its analog must be).\nLet's consider complex deuterides, which are known reducing agents in organic chemistry. A prime candidate is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reagent.\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n*   **Violent reaction?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent, so the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be as well.\n*   **Gas W = D₂?** Yes, the reaction produces deuterium gas, which satisfies the p=n condition.\n*   **Precipitate G?** The product Al(OD)₃ is the deuterated form of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, which is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. So, G = Al(OD)₃.\n*   **Heating G releases B?** Heating Al(OD)₃ causes decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). This is consistent.\n*   **Reagent in organic chemistry?** Yes, LiAlD₄ is used to introduce deuterium atoms into molecules. Its \"very close analog,\" LiAlH₄, is a staple reducing agent.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with the final clue**\nThe reaction of a keto acid with substance X gives a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH, containing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group (and thus at least 3 oxygen atoms).\n*   LiAlD₄ (X) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n*   Ketone reduction: >C=O → >CD-OH\n*   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CH₂OH\n*   Applying this to a keto acid: R-CO-COOH --(LiAlD₄)--> R-CD(OH)-CH₂OH. The product is a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). This product molecule contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nAll clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 6: Perform the calculation**\nThe question asks to \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present**: Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest element**: Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Heaviest element**: Aluminium (Al).\n*   The instruction requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of these two elements found in the formula. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen is specified to be the \"heavier isotope\" D (²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are 4 deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n    *   The isotope of aluminium is ²⁷Al (the only stable one), which has a mass number of 27. There is 1 aluminium atom in LiAlD₄.\n*   **Mass of lightest element's atoms**: 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n*   **Mass of heaviest element's atoms**: 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Cumulative sum**: 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\nTo be certain, let's verify with a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Substance X is identified as LiAlD4.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as isotope D, mass number 2).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminium (present as isotope Al-27, mass number 27).\n# The formula unit contains 4 atoms of D and 1 atom of Al.\n\n# Calculate the mass from the lightest element's atoms.\nmass_D = 2\nnum_D_atoms = 4\ntotal_mass_from_H = num_D_atoms * mass_D\n\n# Calculate the mass from the heaviest element's atoms.\nmass_Al = 27\nnum_Al_atoms = 1\ntotal_mass_from_Al = num_Al_atoms * mass_Al\n\n# Calculate the cumulative sum as requested.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_from_H + total_mass_from_Al\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clue about Substance B:** The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\". Let's convert this temperature to Celsius:\n    *   Temperature in °C = 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is a very strong indicator of heavy water, D₂O (Deuterium Oxide), which melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, we can deduce that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formation of B:** Substance B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This suggests G is a deuterated compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. A common example is a metal deuteroxide, such as Al(OD)₃, which decomposes according to the reaction: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n3.  **Analyze Gas W:** The problem states that Gas W, released during the reaction of X and Y, has an equal number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. Given that deuterium (D, isotope ²H) is involved (from D₂O), a likely candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. Thus, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Deduce Substance X and the reaction:**\n    *   We know that X reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate G, which yields D₂O when heated. This points to a reaction between a strong deuteride-donating agent (X) and heavy water (Y).\n    *   The violent reaction X + Y → D₂ + G suggests X is a metal deuteride and Y is D₂O.\n    *   The clue states that X, and especially its \"very close analog,\" is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. A primary candidate is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. Its very close and famous analog is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's check if the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O matches the description:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent. It produces deuterium gas (W = D₂). It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Heating this precipitate would produce D₂O (B). This hypothesis fits all the chemical clues so far.\n\n5.  **Verify with the final clue:** The reaction of a keto acid with substance X results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Its general structure is R-C(=O)-COOH, so it has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   LiAlD₄ (X) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces ketones to alcohols and carboxylic acids to primary alcohols.\n    *   Reaction: R-C(=O)-COOH --(using LiAlD₄)--> R-CD(OH)-CH₂OH.\n    *   The final product is a diol (contains two -OH groups). This molecule has exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This confirms our identification.\n\n6.  **Calculate the required value:** We need to find the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Atomic Numbers:** Z(Li) = 3, Z(Al) = 13, Z(H) = 1.\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Al).\n    *   **Substance Formula:** LiAlD₄.\n    *   The hydrogen is present as the heavy isotope Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of 2. There are 4 deuterium atoms.\n    *   The aluminium is present as its stable isotope, ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is 1 aluminium atom.\n    *   Sum of masses for the lightest element's atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Sum of masses for the heaviest element's atoms = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.**\n\nTo confirm this simple calculation, a python script can be used.\n```python\n# Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The lightest element present is Hydrogen (atomic number 1). Its isotope is Deuterium (D), with a mass number of 2.\n# The heaviest element present is Aluminium (atomic number 13). Its isotope is Al-27, with a mass number of 27.\n# The question asks for the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n# There are 4 atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium).\nmass_of_lightest_element_atoms = 4 * 2\n\n# There is 1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium).\nmass_of_heaviest_element_atoms = 1 * 27\n\n# Calculate the cumulative sum.\ncumulative_atomic_mass = mass_of_lightest_element_atoms + mass_of_heaviest_element_atoms\n\nprint(cumulative_atomic_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
