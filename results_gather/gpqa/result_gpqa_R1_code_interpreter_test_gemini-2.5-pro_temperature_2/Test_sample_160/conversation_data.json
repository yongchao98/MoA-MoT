    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two different mean free paths in the sample compartment of a transmission electron microscope (TEM):\n\n*   **λ1**: This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding *with each other*. The moving particles and the target particles are both gas molecules.\n*   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the electrons from the microscope's beam as they travel through the residual gas. Here, the moving particles are electrons, and the target particles are the gas molecules.\n\nThe number density of the gas molecules, *n*, is the same in both scenarios, as the pressure, volume, and temperature of the compartment are constant.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Formulas for Mean Free Path\n\nThe formula for mean free path (λ) depends on the nature of the colliding particles. The general form is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where *n* is the number density of target particles and *σ* is the collision cross-section. However, a crucial detail emerges when we consider the relative motion of the particles.\n\n*   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** The particles are all of the same type and are in random thermal motion. In this case, kinetic theory shows that we must account for the relative velocities between the molecules. The standard formula is:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where σ_gg is the gas-kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules. The √2 factor is a result of averaging over all possible collision angles and velocities for particles of similar mass and speed.\n\n*   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they have extremely high kinetic energy and speed, far surpassing the thermal speed of the gas molecules. For example, a 1000 kV electron travels at over 94% of the speed of light. Compared to these ultra-relativistic electrons, the gas molecules are effectively stationary. When the projectile is much faster than the target, the relative velocity is simply the projectile's velocity, and the √2 factor is not included. The formula is:\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where σ_eg is the total scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule.\n\n### Step 3: Compare λ1 and λ2 by Taking Their Ratio\n\nNow we can find the relationship between λ2 and λ1 by dividing the two equations:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nThis equation shows that the relationship between the two mean free paths depends on the value of √2 and the ratio of the two different collision cross-sections.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg and σ_eg)\n\n*   **σ_gg (gas-gas):** This cross-section is determined by the effective physical size of the molecules. In a simplified model, two molecules of diameter *d* collide if their centers come within a distance *d* of each other. The cross-section is therefore σ_gg ≈ πd².\n\n*   **σ_eg (electron-gas):** This cross-section describes the effective area a molecule presents for scattering a point-like electron. The electron interacts with the molecule's electric field. While the interaction is long-range (Coulomb force), a high-energy (1 MeV) particle is very difficult to deflect and tends to \"see\" the atom as more transparent. The scattering cross-section for such high-energy electrons is known to be significantly smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section of the molecule. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that σ_eg < σ_gg.\n\nThis means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number greater than 1.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nLet's insert our finding about the cross-sections back into the ratio equation from Step 3:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a number > 1)\n\nSince √2 ≈ 1.414, this implies:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ > 1.414\n\nNow let's examine the options:\nA) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  (i.e., 1 < λ₂/λ₁ < 1.22)\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (i.e., λ₂/λ₁ >= 1.22)\nC) λ2 = λ1\nD) λ2 < λ1\n\nOur derived result, λ₂ / λ₁ > 1.414, directly contradicts options A, C, and D. It is, however, perfectly consistent with option B, as any number greater than 1.414 is also greater than or equal to 1.22.\n\nThe conclusion is that the mean free path for the high-energy electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ₁)."
