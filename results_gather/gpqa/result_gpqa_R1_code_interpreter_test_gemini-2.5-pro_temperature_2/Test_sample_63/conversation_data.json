    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Decomposition Products\n\nThe problem describes the heating of a salt mixture (A and B) and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the composition and amount of these gases from the information given.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.015 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ **0.20 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This is a key clue that rules out salts like carbonates or oxalates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This indicates an oxidizing gas reacted with the copper. In decomposition reactions of this type, the most common oxidizing gas is oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bind to the copper.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 32.00 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = **0.025 mol O₂**\n    *(Note: Even if the oxidizing gas were N₂O, which also reacts with hot Cu (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO), the 0.80 g mass gain would still correspond to 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, which come from 0.05 mol of N₂O. As we'll see, either pathway leads to the same conclusion about the original salts.)*\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol Gas C**\n    *   Given the starting materials are nitrogen-containing salts (a common assumption for decompositions producing gas), and the gas is inert, Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Verify Mass Conservation and Determine Elemental Composition\n\nLet's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(N₂)\n*   Mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + (0.10 mol * 28.014 g/mol)\n*   Mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\nThis exactly matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that our identification and calculation of the products are correct. The original salts A and B must be composed only of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nNow, let's find the total number of moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** O is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles H₂O) + (2 × moles O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol**\n\n### 3. Identify Salts A and B\n\nThe entire 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. The molar ratio of the elements is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest number (0.05):\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThis ratio N₄H₈O₅ represents the combined elemental formula of the two salts in the equimolar mixture. Since the mixture is equimolar (containing equal moles of A and B), this formula represents the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n(Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nWe are looking for two common salts (composed of N, H, O) that add up to this formula. The most plausible candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's check if these two fit:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\nWe can quickly verify this with the total mass. The equimolar mixture contains n moles of NH₄NO₃ and n moles of NH₄NO₂.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ ≈ 80.0 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64.0 g/mol\n*   Total mass = n * (80.0 + 64.0) = n * 144.0 = 7.20 g\n*   Solving for n: n = 7.20 / 144.0 = 0.05 mol.\nThis confirms the mixture contained 0.05 mol of each salt, which is consistent with the moles of products we calculated.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one molecule of each).\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nI will use a short Python script to verify the numerical calculations.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_O2 = 32.00\nM_N2 = 28.014\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.043\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.043\n\n# Given data\nmass_h2o = 3.60\nmass_o2 = 0.80\nvol_n2 = 2.24\n\n# Moles of products\nn_h2o = mass_h2o / M_H2O\nn_o2 = mass_o2 / M_O2\nn_n2 = vol_n2 / 22.4\n\n# Moles of atoms in the mixture\nmoles_H = 2 * n_h2o\nmoles_N = 2 * n_n2\nmoles_O = 1 * n_h2o + 2 * n_o2\n\n# Combined formula ratio N:H:O\n# We can normalize by the smallest mole value, which is moles_N / 4 = 0.2/4 = 0.05\nratio_N = moles_N / 0.05\nratio_H = moles_H / 0.05\nratio_O = moles_O / 0.05\n\nprint(f\"Combined elemental formula ratio N:H:O is approximately {ratio_N:.0f}:{ratio_H:.0f}:{ratio_O:.0f}\")\n\n# Verification of moles (n) and mass\nn = 0.05\ntotal_mass = n * M_NH4NO3 + n * M_NH4NO2\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass for 0.05 mol of each salt: {total_mass:.2f} g\")\n\n# Final Answer Calculation\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3  # N2H4O3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2  # N2H4O2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"Total atoms in one unit of A and one unit of B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated. The gaseous products were analyzed.\n\n**1. Determine the composition and moles of the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This reagent absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.01 * 2 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This reagent absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, so no acidic gases were produced. This rules out carbonates, oxalates, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the reaction with an oxidizing gas, which provides oxygen atoms to form CuO. The oxidizing gas in the decomposition of such salts is O₂. The mass gain corresponds to the mass of oxygen.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16.00 * 2 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas C:** The remaining volume is 2.24 L at STP. This gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given that the initial materials are likely nitrogen-containing salts (a common source of multiple gaseous products), this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify mass conservation and determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n\nLet's check the total mass of the products:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.01 g/mol ≈ 2.80 g\n*   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our analysis. The salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of N:** from 0.10 mol N₂ → 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of H:** from 0.20 mol H₂O → 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of O:** from 0.20 mol H₂O and 0.025 mol O₂ → (1 * 0.20) + (2 * 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\n**3. Identify salts A and B.**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the greatest common divisor, which is 0.05:\nN : H : O = (0.20/0.05) : (0.40/0.05) : (0.25/0.05) = 4 : 8 : 5.\n\nThe combined formula of the two salts in the equimolar mixture is N₄H₈O₅. Since the mixture is equimolar, this means:\n(Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nWe are looking for two common salts containing only N, H, and O. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids are the most plausible candidates.\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's check if they sum up correctly:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThe formulas match perfectly. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Atoms in salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
