    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**\n    We need to consider two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest. The glass block is observed to be moving with a velocity `v`.\n    *   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame moving along with the glass block. In this frame, the glass block is at rest.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities in Each Frame**\n    *   **Velocity of the Glass Frame (S') relative to the Laboratory Frame (S):** This is given as `v`. Let's assume the motion is along the positive x-axis.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the Glass Frame (S'):** The problem states that the refractive index of the glass is `n`. The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`, where `c` is the speed of light in vacuum. Since the problem sets `c=1`, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The problem also states that the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving. Therefore, the velocity of the light beam in frame S' is `u' = +1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n    To find the velocity `u` of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S), we must use the Lorentz velocity addition formula. The formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    The calculated speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Comparing this result with the given choices:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
