    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the phenotypes of single mutants**\n\nFirst, let's understand the contribution of each gene to anthracnose resistance by looking at the single knock-out mutants. The resistance levels are:\n*   Wild-type (Control): 100%\n*   `g1` mutant: 75% resistance (25% loss)\n*   `g2` mutant: 0% resistance (100% loss)\n*   `g3` mutant: 50% resistance (50% loss)\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that all three genes contribute to resistance. Gene G2 is absolutely essential, as its loss leads to a complete loss of resistance. Gene G3 has a more significant role than G1.\n\n### **2. Analyze the double mutants to determine gene hierarchy (Epistasis)**\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. In a double mutant, if the phenotype matches one of the single mutants, the gene corresponding to that single mutant is considered \"epistatic\" to the other gene. The epistatic gene usually functions upstream in the same pathway.\n\n*   **`g1g2` double mutant**:\n    *   `g1` resistance = 75%\n    *   `g2` resistance = 0%\n    *   `g1g2` resistance = 0%\n    *   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant (0% resistance) is the same as the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1.\n\n*   **`g2g3` double mutant**:\n    *   `g2` resistance = 0%\n    *   `g3` resistance = 50%\n    *   `g2g3` resistance = 0%\n    *   The phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant (0% resistance) is the same as the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G3.\n\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and the problem states that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, **G2 is the best candidate for the transcription factor.**\n\n### **3. Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3**\n\nNow let's look at the `g1g3` double mutant to understand the relationship between these two genes.\n\n*   `g1` resistance = 75% (25% loss)\n*   `g3` resistance = 50% (50% loss)\n*   `g1g3` resistance = 10% (90% loss)\n\nThe phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant (10% resistance) is not the same as either of the single mutants, so there is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\nInstead, the effect of the double mutation is much more severe than the simple sum of the individual effects (25% loss + 50% loss = 75% loss). This phenomenon is known as a **synergistic interaction**. Such an interaction often indicates that the two genes have **redundant functions** or operate in parallel pathways. When both are knocked out, the system almost completely collapses, which is consistent with the observed 90% loss of resistance.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the given options**\n\nBased on our analysis, the best model is that G2 is a transcription factor that regulates both G1 and G3, which in turn act redundantly or in parallel to confer resistance.\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   This is incorrect. Our analysis shows G2, not G1, is the transcription factor because it is epistatic to the others.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   This is incorrect. G3 is not epistatic to G1 (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g3` phenotype of 50%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   This is incorrect. G1 is not epistatic to G3 (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g1` phenotype of 75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This aligns with our finding.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is the best explanation for the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This part is technically incorrect, as we demonstrated. However, out of all the options, this one contains the two most accurate and important conclusions from the data: G2's role as the upstream transcription factor and the redundant nature of G1 and G3. The error in the final clause is likely a mistake in the question's options, but the other statements in this option provide the best overall description of the genetic network.\n\nTherefore, option D is the best choice despite a minor inaccuracy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
