    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Who are the \"observers\"?** There are two reference frames: the Galaxy's frame and the ejecta's frame.\n    *   **What is the relative motion?** The ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center moves towards it at `v = 60 000 km/s`. Due to the principle of relativity, this means from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed `v = 60 000 km/s`.\n    *   **What time is measured?** A time of `50 seconds` passes in the ejecta's reference frame. Since this is the time measured in the frame that is *moving* (the ejecta's frame, where the \"clock\" is located), this is the \"proper time,\" denoted as `Δt₀`.\n    *   **What is the question?** I need to find the distance the ejecta travels *as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame*. Let's call this distance `d_galaxy`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Principles:**\n    *   The problem involves speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60 000 km/s`, while the speed of light `c` is approximately `300 000 km/s`). This means the effects of Special Relativity are important and cannot be ignored.\n    *   The key concept here is **time dilation**. An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving frame (the ejecta). The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt_galaxy`) will be longer than the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`).\n    *   The distance formula in the Galaxy's frame is straightforward: `d_galaxy = v * Δt_galaxy`. I know `v`, but I need to calculate `Δt_galaxy`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   **Time Dilation Formula:** `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n        *   `Δt` is the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy).\n        *   `Δt₀` is the proper time, measured in the moving frame (ejecta).\n        *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor Formula:** `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n        *   `v` is the relative speed.\n        *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   **Distance Formula:** `d_galaxy = v * Δt_galaxy`\n\n4.  **Plan the Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate the ratio `v/c`.\n    2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n    3.  Use `γ` and the proper time `Δt₀` to find the dilated time `Δt_galaxy`.\n    4.  Use `Δt_galaxy` and the speed `v` to calculate the final distance `d_galaxy`.\n    5.  Alternatively, combine the formulas: `d_galaxy = v * Δt_galaxy = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * Δt₀ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. This is a more direct way to calculate the final answer and reduces rounding errors.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation using a Python script for precision.**\n    *   Define the constants:\n        *   `v = 60000` km/s\n        *   `c = 300000` km/s (standard value for the speed of light in vacuum)\n        *   `dt0 = 50` s (proper time)\n    *   The formula to compute is: `d = v * dt0 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)`\n    *   I will write a Python script to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50  # seconds in the ejecta's frame (proper time)\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta = v / c\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dilated time)\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\n# Print the final result\n# We can also calculate it directly: distance = v * dt0 / sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n# distance_direct = v * dt0 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\nprint(distance_galaxy)\n```",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem involving special relativity.\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v` = 60 000 km/s.\n    *   Proper time (time in the moving frame of the ejecta), `Δt₀` = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light, `c` ≈ 300 000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Identify the unknown:**\n    *   Distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame, `d`.\n\n3.  **Choose the correct physics formula:**\n    *   Distance is speed multiplied by time: `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   Here, `v` is the speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy.\n    *   `Δt` must be the time elapsed in the *Galaxy's* reference frame.\n    *   The time given (50 s) is in the *ejecta's* frame (`Δt₀`).\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the formulas:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `γ`:\n        `d = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n        `d = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) `\n\n5.  **Calculate the value:**\n    *   This is the calculation performed by the Python script.\n    *   `v` = 60000 km/s\n    *   `c` = 300000 km/s\n    *   `v/c` = 60000 / 300000 = 0.2\n    *   `(v/c)²` = 0.2² = 0.04\n    *   `1 - (v/c)²` = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96\n    *   `sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) ` = `sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   `v * Δt₀` = 60000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Python output:**\n    *   The code executed exactly this calculation.\n    *   The output is `3061862.178478973` km.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2 940 000 km\n    *   B) 2 880 000 km\n    *   C) 3 060 000 km\n    *   D) 3 000 000 km\n\n8.  **Analyze the result:**\n    *   The calculated value is `3,061,862.18` km.\n    *   This is very close to option C, `3,060,000` km. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's option creation.\n    *   Option D (3,000,000 km) would be the answer if we ignored relativity (`d = v * Δt₀`), which is incorrect.\n    *   The relativistic effect correctly predicts a *longer* distance travelled because time in the stationary (Galaxy) frame passes faster than in the moving (ejecta) frame. Thus, the answer must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This eliminates A, B, and D. Option C is the only plausible answer.\n\n9.  **Final Conclusion:** The calculation matches option C most closely. This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   Frame 1: The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S).\n    *   Frame 2: The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative speed between the two frames, `v = 60 000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame, `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it's measured by a clock in the moving frame.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300 000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine what needs to be calculated:**\n    *   The distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   To find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we need to use the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   We are given the time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`), not the Galaxy's frame. Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval than an observer in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        *   `v/c = 60000 km/s / 300000 km/s = 0.2`\n        *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:\n        *   `d = v * Δt = 60000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        *   `d = (60000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nThe code I ran previously computed this value precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50  # seconds in the ejecta's frame (proper time)\n\n# The distance in the Galaxy reference frame is d = v * dt_galaxy\n# The time in the Galaxy reference frame is dt_galaxy = gamma * dt0\n# The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# Combining these, we get: d = v * dt0 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\ndistance_galaxy = (v * dt0) / math.sqrt(1 - (v / c)**2)\n\nprint(distance_galaxy)\n```\nThe output of the code was `3061862.178478973`.\n\nThis value, `3,061,862 km`, is closest to option C.\n\n*   A) 2 940 000 km\n*   B) 2 880 000 km\n*   **C) 3 060 000 km**\n*   D) 3 000 000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer, `60000 km/s * 50 s`)\n\n<<<C>>>",
