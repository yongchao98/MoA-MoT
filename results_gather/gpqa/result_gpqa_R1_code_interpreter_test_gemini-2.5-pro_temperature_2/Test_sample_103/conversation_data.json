    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. As the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star moves towards and away from us. This motion causes its spectral lines to shift to the blue and red, respectively.\n\nThe magnitude of this wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, according to the Doppler formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n\nThe maximum observed shift, $(\\Delta \\lambda)_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as $K_{star}$.\nTherefore, $K_{star} \\propto (\\Delta \\lambda)_{max}$.\n\n**2. Relate Observables to Physical Quantities**\n\nWe are given the periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   Planet #1: $(\\Delta \\lambda_1)_{max} = 5$ mÅ\n*   Planet #2: $(\\Delta \\lambda_2)_{max} = 7$ mÅ\n\nFrom the proportionality above, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n$\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{(\\Delta \\lambda_2)_{max}}{(\\Delta \\lambda_1)_{max}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**3. Derive the Relationship Between RV Semi-amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (T)**\n\nNow, we need to find the physical relationship between $K_{star}$ and the planet's orbital period, $T$.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude for a star with a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi a_{star} \\sin i}{T}$\nwhere $a_{star}$ is the radius of the star's orbit around the system's center of mass, $T$ is the orbital period, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nThe star's orbital radius $a_{star}$ is related to the planet's orbital radius $a_p$ and the masses of the star ($M_{star}$) and planet ($m_p$) by the center of mass equation: $M_{star} a_{star} = m_p a_p$. The total separation is $a = a_{star} + a_p$. We can write $a_{star}$ in terms of $a$:\n$a_{star} = a \\frac{m_p}{M_{star} + m_p}$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi \\sin i}{T} \\left( a \\frac{m_p}{M_{star} + m_p} \\right)$\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law to replace the orbital separation, $a$, with the period, $T$:\n$T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_{star} + m_p)}$\nSolving for $a$:\n$a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_{star} + m_p)T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $a$ back into the equation for $K_{star}$:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi \\sin i}{T} \\frac{m_p}{M_{star} + m_p} \\left( \\frac{G(M_{star} + m_p)T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\nLet's simplify this expression by combining terms and pulling out the dependence on $T$:\n$K_{star} = \\left[ \\frac{(2\\pi)^{1/3} G^{1/3} \\sin i \\cdot m_p}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} \\right] \\cdot T^{-1/3}$\n\n**4. Apply the Relationship to the Two Systems**\n\nThe problem states that the two systems have:\n*   Identical star masses ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n*   Similar (and thus we assume identical for the ratio) planet masses ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).\n*   It is a standard assumption in such problems that the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$), or that we are comparing the maximum possible values ($\\sin i=1$).\n\nWith these conditions, the entire term in the square brackets is a constant for both systems. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n$K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\nThis can be rewritten to express the period in terms of the RV semi-amplitude:\n$T \\propto K_{star}^{-3}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}\\right)^{3}$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{K_{star2}}{K_{star1}} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation for the period ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\nNow, we'll calculate the numerical value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_code>\n\nThe result is approximately 0.364.

    "The user's question asks to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, planet #2 to planet #1. The solution relies on understanding the radial velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets and its relation to orbital parameters.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Observational Data**\nThe primary data from the Radial Velocity (RV) method is the periodic Doppler shift of the host star's spectral lines. The magnitude of this shift is given as:\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for system 1, $(\\Delta \\lambda_1)_{max} = 5$ mÅ.\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for system 2, $(\\Delta \\lambda_2)_{max} = 7$ mÅ.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula, $\\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$, relates the wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The maximum observed wavelength shift, $(\\Delta \\lambda)_{max}$, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, which we denote as $K_{star}$.\nTherefore, $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to $(\\Delta \\lambda)_{max}$.\n\nFrom this, we can establish the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n$\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{(\\Delta \\lambda_2)_{max}}{(\\Delta \\lambda_1)_{max}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**Step 2: Relate RV Semi-Amplitude ($K_{star}$) to Orbital Period (T)**\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude of a star orbited by a single planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K_{star} = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T$ is the orbital period.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proportionality**\nThe problem provides the following information to simplify the relationship:\n*   The stars have exactly the same masses: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses (Neptune-like): We assume $m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$.\n*   It is a standard simplification in such problems to assume the orbital inclinations are the same, or we are comparing edge-on systems where $\\sin i = 1$. So we assume $\\sin i_1 = \\sin i_2$.\n\nGiven these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K_{star}$ are constant for both systems, except for the period, $T$. This leaves us with the following proportionality:\n$K_{star} \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\nTo find the relationship for the period, we can rearrange this proportionality:\n$T^{-1/3} \\propto K_{star}$\n$T \\propto (K_{star})^{-3}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Using the proportionality from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^{3}$\n\nFrom Step 1, we know that $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{7}{5}$. Therefore, the inverse ratio is $\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the period ratio:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\nNow we perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\nperiod_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This value matches option C. Planet #2 has an orbital period that is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The calculation from the previous step is correct. Let's re-verify the reasoning and conclusion.\n\n### Summary of Reasoning\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift to Velocity**: The observed wavelength shift, $(\\Delta\\lambda)_{max}$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K_{star}$.\n    *   $K_{star} \\propto (\\Delta\\lambda)_{max}$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the stars' velocities is: $\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n2.  **Velocity to Period**: The radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K_{star}$, is related to the planet's orbital period, $T$, and mass, $m_p$, and the star's mass, $M_{star}$. The formula simplifies to the following proportionality when the masses ($m_p$ and $M_{star}$) are the same for both systems:\n    *   $K_{star} \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$\n\n3.  **Solving for the Period Ratio**: To find the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we can rearrange the proportionality:\n    *   $T^{1/3} \\propto \\frac{1}{K_{star}}$\n    *   $T \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{K_{star}}\\right)^3 = (K_{star})^{-3}$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the periods is: $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^3$.\n\n4.  **Calculation**: We substitute the known velocity ratio into the equation:\n    *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.36. This corresponds to answer choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
