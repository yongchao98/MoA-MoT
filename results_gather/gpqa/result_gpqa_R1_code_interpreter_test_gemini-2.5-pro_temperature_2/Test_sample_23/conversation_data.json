    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, a product of hydrogenation, and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, this is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for saturated hydrocarbons:\n        *   For an alkane, `C_n H_{2n+2}`: Mass fraction H = `(2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. This fraction approaches `2/14 = 1/7` as n becomes large, but it's always greater than `1/7`.\n        *   For a cycloalkane, `C_n H_{2n}`: Mass fraction H = `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7`.\n    *   The value `1/7` is approximately `0.142857...`, which is a perfect match for the given 14.28%. Thus, Z must be a cycloalkane with the general formula `C_n H_{2n}`.\n    *   We are told Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture, there must be another component C.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (C + cyclohexane) gives only cyclohexane. This means hydrogenation of C must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   If C were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane, C6H12), the disproportionation reaction X -> Y would be `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H12`. This would require the reactants A and B to have a total of 24 hydrogen atoms. However, A and B are unsaturated C6 rings, so their maximum possible hydrogen count is 10 each (cyclohexene, C6H10), for a total of 20. This is a contradiction.\n    *   Let's reconsider the property \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While saturated compounds fit, aromatic compounds like **benzene (C6H6)** also do not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions (i.e., without a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C) and cyclohexane (D)**.\n        *   Is Y equimolar? Yes, by definition.\n        *   Does Y not decolorize Br2 water? Yes.\n        *   Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z? `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`; `C6H12 + H2 -> No reaction`. So yes, the only product is cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Is Z a constituent of Y? Yes, cyclohexane is in Y.\n    *   This hypothesis for Y = {Benzene, Cyclohexane} fits all conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation that transforms mixture X into mixture Y. Since Y is equimolar and X is equimolar, it's reasonable to assume a 1:1 stoichiometry: `A + B -> C + D`.\n    *   Substituting our identified C and D: **`A + B -> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)`**\n    *   This is a classic intermolecular hydrogen transfer, a type of disproportionation reaction. A donates hydrogen atoms and is oxidized to benzene, while B accepts hydrogen atoms and is reduced to cyclohexane.\n    *   By conservation of atoms:\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in A and B must be `6 + 12 = 18`.\n        *   The carbon skeletons must be C6 for both.\n    *   We are given more information about A and B:\n        *   They both decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated).\n        *   They both hydrogenate to give only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms they must have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n        *   There are **no conjugated multiple bonds** in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   Let's list the possible C6 unsaturated cyclic compounds that hydrogenate to cyclohexane:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) - Has 10 H atoms. No conjugated bonds.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) - Has 8 H atoms. **Has conjugated bonds.** This is excluded.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) - Has 8 H atoms. Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   We need two different compounds, A and B, whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only combination that fits is C6H10 and C6H8.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X must be an equimolar mixture of:\n        *   **A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n        *   **B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**\n    *   The reaction is: `Cyclohexene + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene -> Cyclohexane + Benzene`. In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2 H) to benzene, and cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2 H) to cyclohexane. This is not quite right.\n    *   Let's re-examine the hydrogen transfer. `A(C6H10) + B(C6H8) -> C(C6H6) + D(C6H12)`. Total H is conserved (18 -> 18). One molecule, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (`B`), gives up hydrogens to become benzene (`C`). The other molecule, cyclohexene (`A`), must accept them. `C6H8 -> C6H6 + 2H`. `C6H10 + 2H -> C6H12`. This works perfectly.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (A): Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (B): 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n```python\n# Script to verify the mass fraction calculation.\n# Atomic weights\nH_mass = 1.008\nC_mass = 12.011\n\n# The proposed formula for Z is C6H12\nn = 6\n# Formula for Cycloalkane is C_n H_{2n}\nformula = f\"C{n}H{2*n}\"\ntotal_mass = n * C_mass + 2 * n * H_mass\nh_fraction = (2 * n * H_mass) / total_mass\n\n# Using integer masses, which is common in such problems\nh_fraction_int = (2 * n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2 * n * 1)\n\nprint(f\"Formula: {formula}\")\nprint(f\"H-fraction using precise masses: {h_fraction:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"H-fraction using integer masses (1/7): {h_fraction_int:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Target value: 0.1428\")\n\n# The question is about the sum of H atoms in the two components of mixture X\n# Component A: Cyclohexene (C6H10) -> 10 H atoms\n# Component B: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) -> 8 H atoms\ntotal_h_atoms = 10 + 8\nprint(f\"Total number of hydrogen atoms: {total_h_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step logical deduction to identify the chemical compounds and answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon that is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, i.e., an alkane or a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. We can determine its general formula from this information. Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1):\n    Mass Fraction of H = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) = 0.1428\n*   0.1428 is very close to the fraction 1/7.\n    y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7\n    7y ≈ 12x + y\n    6y ≈ 12x\n    y ≈ 2x\n*   The formula that fits y = 2x is CₙH₂ₙ. For a saturated hydrocarbon, this must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Let's verify the mass fraction for C₆H₁₂:\n    Mass Fraction of H = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / (72.066 + 12.096) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437. Using integer masses gives 12 / (72 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them C and D.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one of the liquids, say **D**, is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated. Therefore, component C must also be saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + cyclohexane) gives only cyclohexane. This means that component C, upon hydrogenation, also yields cyclohexane.\n*   A possible candidate for C is an isomer of cyclohexane (e.g., methylcyclopentane), but that would imply different carbon skeletons, which contradicts that all compounds lead back to the same parent structure Z.\n*   A more likely candidate is an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms: **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂).\n*   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This combination fits all the conditions for mixture Y.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain double bonds).\n*   Heating mixture X with a platinum catalyst causes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. This means:\n    `A + B --[Pt, heat]--> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)`\n*   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One component is oxidized to benzene, and the other is reduced to cyclohexane.\n*   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in A and B must equal the total number in benzene and cyclohexane: 6 + 12 = **18 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   Also, both A and B must have a 6-carbon ring structure, since the hydrogenation of mixture X yields only cyclohexane.\n*   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the components of X. We need to find two different C₆ unsaturated cyclic molecules that fit this description and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: It has one double bond (not conjugated), decolorizes bromine water, and has **10 hydrogen atoms**. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈):\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It decolorizes bromine water and has **8 hydrogen atoms**. This is a valid candidate.\n*   Let's check the total number of hydrogen atoms for this pair:\n    H atoms in Cyclohexene + H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n*   This matches the required total. Thus, mixture X is composed of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The disproportionation reaction is:\n    `C₆H₁₀ (Cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-Cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (Cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (Benzene)`\n    In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2 H) to benzene, while cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2 H) to become cyclohexane. This is an incorrect transfer of hydrogens.\n    The correct interpretation is that 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) provides the hydrogen atoms, and another molecule does as well, or a single component is responsible. The statement \"an equimolar mixture Y... is formed as a result of disproportionation\" is key. A common reaction is the disproportionation of a cyclohexadiene into benzene and cyclohexane. For example `3 C₆H₈ -> 2 C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂`. This does not produce an equimolar mixture.\n    The most straightforward interpretation that yields an equimolar product from an equimolar reactant is the intermolecular reaction:\n    `A + B → C + D`\n    Where A and B are from mixture X and C and D are from mixture Y.\n    Our proposed compounds satisfy the conservation of mass (`C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈` is `C₁₂H₁₈`, and `C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂` is also `C₁₂H₁₈`). This hydrogen transfer between the two components is the most logical reaction path given the constraints.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Liquid A is Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B is 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n```python\n# The purpose of this code is to confirm the logical deductions.\n# 1. Verify the mass fraction of Hydrogen in Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n# 2.

    "Here is the breakdown of the solution based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The hydrocarbon Z is a result of exhaustive hydrogenation and is unreactive towards further hydrogenation, indicating it's a saturated compound (an alkane or cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value corresponds to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   For a saturated hydrocarbon, let's test the general formulas. For a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using integer masses C=12, H=1) is (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Z is a common solvent. The most widely used cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Thus, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of the components of Y is Z itself, which is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n    *   Hydrogenation of the other component of Y must also produce cyclohexane.\n    *   Since the second component does not decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane, the most logical choice is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene doesn't react with bromine water without a catalyst and its hydrogenation produces cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene** and **cyclohexane**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The conversion of X to Y is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context means an intermolecular hydrogen transfer.\n        `A + B --[Pt catalyst]--> Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`\n    *   Since A and B both hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane, they must both possess a six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   The problem specifies that molecules in mixture X do not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total number in the products (benzene + cyclohexane). The total number of hydrogen atoms is:\n        Total H atoms = H in Benzene (C₆H₆) + H in Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) = 6 + 12 = **18**.\n    *   So, the two liquids in mixture X must have a combined total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   We need to find two non-conjugated, six-membered ring alkenes that fit this criterion:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** has one double bond (non-conjugated) and **10** hydrogen atoms.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds and **8** hydrogen atoms. (Note: 1,3-cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated).\n    *   Checking the sum of hydrogen atoms for this pair: 10 + 8 = 18. This combination fits all the conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene)\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
