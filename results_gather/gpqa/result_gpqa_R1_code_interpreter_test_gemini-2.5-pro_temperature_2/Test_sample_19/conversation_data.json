    "This question is about the core assumptions behind the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\nThe **Impulse Approximation (IA)** simplifies the complex problem of a probe (like an electron or neutrino) interacting with a nucleus. The central idea is that the interaction happens with a single nucleon (a proton or neutron) inside the nucleus, and this interaction is so quick and energetic that for the brief moment of the interaction, the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle. The other nucleons in the nucleus are treated as spectators, and the binding forces holding the nucleon in the nucleus don't have time to act.\n\nNow let's analyze the four statements in light of this definition:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the first and most fundamental tenet of the IA. The probe doesn't interact with the nucleus as a collective whole, or with the meson exchange currents that mediate the forces between nucleons. It picks out and interacts with just one nucleon. This is a necessary condition to treat the process as an interaction with a quasi-free particle. **This assumption is essential.**\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. It implies that the incoming probe can reach the target nucleon, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) can leave the nucleus, without any further significant interactions. These secondary interactions are called \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). The simplest form of the impulse approximation, the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), assumes no FSI. Therefore, assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" to the incoming and outgoing particles is a key part of this approximation scheme. **This assumption is essential.**\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement is about the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation simplifies the *nucleon's interaction with the nucleus*, not the physics *inside the nucleon*. One can use the impulse approximation while still treating the quarks inside the nucleon relativistically (as is done in deep inelastic scattering). Therefore, this assumption is not a requirement for the impulse approximation itself; it belongs to a different level of modeling concerning the nucleon's form factors or structure functions. **This assumption is not essential.**\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" in the impulse approximation. The interaction imparts a large momentum (\"impulse\") over a very short time. This interaction time is assumed to be much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus's potential well. Consequently, during the brief interaction, the binding forces are negligible, and the nucleon reacts as if it were free. **This assumption is essential.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is jointly implied by the assumptions that the interaction targets a single nucleon (1), the nucleus is transparent to the particles involved (2), and the binding forces are negligible during the brief interaction (4). Assumption (3) is an independent approximation about the nucleon's internal structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
