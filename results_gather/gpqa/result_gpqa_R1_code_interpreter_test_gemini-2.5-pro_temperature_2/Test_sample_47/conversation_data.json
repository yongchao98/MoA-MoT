    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of cyclohexanone with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction type:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Under neutral or acidic conditions, a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Cyclohexanone has two equivalent α-carbons (C2 and C6), each with two hydrogen atoms. The reaction will replace one of these hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction type:** An α-halo ketone treated with a strong base undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate, which then opens to form a rearranged carboxylate anion, resulting in a ring contraction.\n*   **Mechanism outline:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic α-proton from the carbon on the other side of the carbonyl group (C6). The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate. The ring opens by cleaving the bond between the two carbons that were originally the carbonyl carbon and the other α-carbon of the starting material. This cleavage results in a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** After protonation (e.g., during workup), the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid).\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reaction type:** Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n*   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent.\n*   **Reaction type:** Reduction of an acid chloride. This specific reagent is known for its selectivity; it reduces highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes but is generally not reactive enough to further reduce the aldehyde to an alcohol under controlled conditions. This selectivity is the primary reason for using this reagent instead of a stronger one like LiAlH₄.\n*   **Product 4:** The acid chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nTo count the number of sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a five-membered ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n\n    H(a)-C(=O)\n       |\n     C1-H(b)\n    /   \\\n  C2H₂(c,d)--C5H₂(c,d)\n  |          |\n  C3H₂(e,f)--C4H₂(e,f)\n\nThe molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde H(a), the carbonyl C=O, the C1-H(b) bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry has the following consequences:\n*   The protons on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C5.\n*   The protons on C3 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C4.\n\nNow, we identify each unique set of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H(a)):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. This is **Set 1**.\n2.  **The methine proton on C1 (H(b)):** This proton is attached to the carbon that bears the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is **Set 2**.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Each of these carbons has two geminal protons. Due to the presence of the substituent on C1, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are diastereotopic. This means they are chemically non-equivalent. Let's call them H(c) and H(d). The plane of symmetry makes the H(c) on C2 equivalent to the H(c) on C5, and the H(d) on C2 equivalent to the H(d) on C5. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 constitute two distinct sets. These are **Set 3** and **Set 4**.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two geminal protons on C3 (and C4) are also diastereotopic because of their fixed spatial relationship to the substituent on C1. Let's call them H(e) and H(f). The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 and C4 equivalent in pairs. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C4 constitute two distinct sets. These are **Set 5** and **Set 6**.\n\n**Summary of distinct hydrogen sets:**\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde-H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2/C5-H (one type, 2H total)\n*   Set 4: C2/C5-H (other type, 2H total)\n*   Set 5: C3/C4-H (one type, 2H total)\n*   Set 6: C3/C4-H (other type, 2H total)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms is 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
