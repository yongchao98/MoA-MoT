    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if its molecular structure is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image). This usually means it lacks any internal elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$) or a center of inversion ($i$).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them (`Cl`, `H`, `C(methyl)`, `C(ethyl)`) lie in the same plane. A planar molecule always has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `3aR`, `7aS`, and `E` define a specific stereoisomer of a molecule that has multiple chiral centers. For a molecule with chiral centers to be inactive, it must be a meso compound, which requires an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The parent skeleton might have some symmetry, but the presence of the `8-(chloromethylene)` group (`=CHCl`), which is itself unsymmetrical, on the bridged system almost certainly removes any possibility of overall molecular symmetry. Since the name specifies a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule, this compound is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The `(2R,3S)` designation describes a specific stereoisomer. For a molecule with two stereocenters, if the substituents on both centers are the same (here: `H`, `CH3`, `COOH`, and the other chiral carbon), the `(R,S)` diastereomer is a meso compound. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Indeed, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid possesses a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the compound above.\n    *   **Analysis:** The `(2R,3R)` stereoisomer does not possess any internal symmetry elements. It is one of an enantiomeric pair, with its mirror image being the `(2S,2S)` stereoisomer. Since it is a chiral molecule and a single enantiomer is specified, it will be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and a hydroxyl group (at C1).\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=CH-` (path around the ring), and (4) `-CH=CH-CH2-` (path around the ring the other way). Since the paths are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `s` descriptor indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a highly symmetrical molecule. In a chair conformation (with all OH groups either axial or equatorial), there are three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one carbon bearing an OH group and the opposite carbon atom. The presence of these symmetry planes makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name corresponds to `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` (cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone).\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for chirality.\n        *   **Chiral centers:** There are no stereocenters in the molecule. The `CH` carbon in the isobutyl group is attached to two methyl groups. The carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are also not stereocenters as the ring is symmetrically substituted.\n        *   **Molecular symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry in a suitable conformation. This plane can contain the `O=C-CH2-CH` fragment and bisect the cyclopentyl ring. An object with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
