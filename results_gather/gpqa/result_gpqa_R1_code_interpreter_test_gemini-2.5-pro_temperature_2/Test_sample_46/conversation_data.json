    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure's features like rings or double/triple bonds.\nThe formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   C = 9 (number of carbons)\n*   H = 11 (number of hydrogens)\n*   N = 1 (number of nitrogens)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (accounting for 1 degree of unsaturation), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester (around 1715-1735 cm⁻¹, especially when conjugated with an aromatic ring). It is too high for a typical amide C=O (which usually appears at 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and an ester C=O group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (-CH₂-). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) in an ethyl fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons shows a quartet multiplicity (q), meaning it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (-CH₃). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates this -CH₂- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom within an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of an amine (-NH₂) group, which aligns perfectly with our IR analysis. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Seeing two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') splitting pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (EDG), like the -NH₂ group.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), like the ester group (-COOR).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)\n*   A carbonyl group (C=O)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nThese fragments can be assembled in only one way that is consistent with all data: an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) and an amine group (-NH₂) attached at the para positions of a benzene ring. This gives us **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's confirm this against the given options.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is meta-substituted, not para. It is also an amide, which does not match the IR C=O frequency. Incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is `CH₃CH₂C(=O)O-Ar-NH₂`. This has an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, not an oxygen. The -CH₂- quartet would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This compound has a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and integrate to 1H in the NMR. This contradicts the data. Incorrect.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** Has an -NH₂ group and an ethyl ester group (-COOEt) in a para arrangement on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Correct.\n    *   **IR:** Has a primary amine and a conjugated ester C=O. Correct.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethoxy group (`t` at ~1.2, `q` at ~4.5), a para-disubstituted ring (two doublets), and a broad -NH₂ singlet. Correct.\n\nAll spectroscopic data points perfectly to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
