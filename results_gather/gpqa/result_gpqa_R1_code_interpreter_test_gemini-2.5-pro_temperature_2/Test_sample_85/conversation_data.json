    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\nThe product for both reactions is a derivative of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   `tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` describes a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The \"pyran\" part indicates a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom. The \"-2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group at the C2 position (next to the ring oxygen, which is numbered as C1). This is also known as a δ-lactone.\n*   `4-ethyl` indicates that an ethyl group is attached to the carbon at position 4 of this ring.\n*   This molecule possesses a single chiral center at C4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   Reaction A yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction B yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\nThe options for the starting materials are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   Let's decipher this chemical name. It describes a molecule with both a carboxylic acid (`-pentanoic acid`) and an ester (`isobutoxy-oxo`). The most logical structure that can form the product lactone is a monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n*   The structure is: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu.\n    *   Let's verify this structure. The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). Numbering starts from the acid's carbon as C1.\n    *   `C1(OOH) - C2(H₂) - C3(H, Et) - C4(H₂) - C5(=O)O-iBu`\n    *   The molecule has a carboxylic acid group at C1 and an isobutyl ester group at C5.\n    *   It has a chiral center at C3, which has the ethyl group. This C3 of the starting material will become the C4 of the final lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material directly dictates the stereochemistry of the product, as the reactions do not affect this chiral center.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reactants:** A + LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact (it will be deprotonated to a carboxylate salt).\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  The ester group at C5 (-COOiBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The intermediate formed (after protonation in the workup step) is `3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid` [HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH].\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the C1-carboxylic acid and the C5-hydroxyl group to form the six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence does not involve making or breaking any bonds at the chiral C3 center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** To produce the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Reactants:** B + BH₃ (Borane), followed by H⁺ workup.\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** BH₃ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The intermediate formed is `isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate` [HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu].\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the same six-membered δ-lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral C3 center is unaffected. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion:** To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   Starting material A must be the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
