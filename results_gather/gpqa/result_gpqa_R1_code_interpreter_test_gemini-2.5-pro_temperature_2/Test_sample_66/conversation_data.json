    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum representation: $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ because the electrons are in p-orbitals.\n        *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n        *   The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n    *   A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar$. So, this outcome corresponds to the individual quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is an uncoupled state: $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principles of Quantum Measurement:**\n    *   The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\phi\\rangle$, and finding it in state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the squared magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states:\n        $P = |\\langle \\psi | \\phi \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   In our case, this is:\n        $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n3.  **Use the Properties of Angular Momentum Coupling (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients):**\n    *   The term $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients relate the coupled basis $\\{|l, m\\rangle\\}$ to the uncoupled basis $\\{|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle\\}$.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless the z-components of the angular momentum add up:\n        $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   If this condition is not met, the coefficient is zero, meaning the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ is not a component of the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Check the Selection Rule for the Given Problem:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the required sum with the initial state's m-value: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n*Alternative Explanation using Conservation of $L_z$:*\n*   The initial state $|l,m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n*   The final measured state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its eigenvalue is $(m_1 + m_2)\\hbar = (-1 - 1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n*   Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator ($L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$) are orthogonal.\n*   The probability of a transition from the initial state to the final state is the squared magnitude of their inner product, which is zero due to their orthogonality.\n\nTo confirm this with a calculation, we can use a python script to compute the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nfrom sympy import N\n\n# The problem is about coupling l1=1 and l2=1 to a total l=2.\n# The initial state is |l=2, m=-1>.\n# The desired measurement outcome is m1=-1 and m2=-1.\n# The probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>.\n# Here, <1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>.\n\nl1 = 1\nm1 = -1\nl2 = 1\nm2 = -1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient\n# Note: sympy uses the notation CG(j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m)\ncg_coefficient = CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient.\nprobability = N(abs(cg_coefficient)**2)\n\nprint(f\"The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <{l1},{m1}; {l2},{m2} | {l},{m}> is: {cg_coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n</execute_code>\n[execution_results]\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1,-1; 1,-1 | 2,-1> is: 0\nThe probability is: 0\n[/execution_results]\nThe code confirms that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is 0, and therefore the probability is also 0.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for two electrons. We are given the initial state of the system in the coupled representation and the desired final state after the measurement.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ as the electrons are in p-orbitals.\n    *   The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$.\n    *   The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. The total angular momentum in the z-direction is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, and its eigenvalue for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n*   **Final State:** The measurement collapses the system into a state where the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are both $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for the z-component of angular momentum is $L_{iz}|l_i, m_i\\rangle = m_i\\hbar|l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ means the quantum number for the first electron is $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ means the quantum number for the second electron is $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This corresponds to the uncoupled state $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability:**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system initially in state $|\\phi\\rangle$ and finding it in a specific final state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the squared magnitude of their inner product:\n$P = |\\langle \\psi | \\phi \\rangle|^2$\n\nSubstituting our states:\n$P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients represent the projection of a coupled state onto an uncoupled state.\n\n**3. Apply the Selection Rule:**\n\nA fundamental property of adding angular momenta and a selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. This means that for the coefficient to be non-zero, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers must equal the total z-component quantum number:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check this condition for our specific values:\n*   From the initial state, $m = -1$.\n*   From the desired final state, $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Their sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the selection rule is violated.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nBecause the selection rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nThis means it is impossible to find the system in a state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ if it started in a state with a total $m = -1$. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the measurement process.\n\n<<<C>>>"
