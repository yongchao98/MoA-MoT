    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical System:**\n    *   The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape. The symmetry axis is along the z-axis, and the oscillation occurs along this axis.\n    *   Any oscillating charge distribution, when viewed from a distance much larger than its size (in the radiation zone), can be approximated by its lowest-order multipole moment. For a charge distribution oscillating back and forth along an axis, the dominant radiating term is the electric dipole moment.\n    *   Therefore, we can model the oscillating spheroid as a simple oscillating electric dipole with its moment `p` aligned with the z-axis: `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) ẑ`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    *   The formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n        `dP/dΩ = f(θ, λ) = C * sin²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the angle between the dipole axis (z-axis) and the direction of observation, and `C` is a factor that depends on the dipole's properties and the radiation frequency, but not on the angle `θ`.\n    *   The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation). So, `A = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n        `P_30 = dP/dΩ` at `θ = 30°` = `C * sin²(30°)`.\n    *   The value of `sin(30°)` is `1/2`. Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   So, `P_30 = C * (1/4)`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `P_30 / A = (C * 1/4) / C = 1/4`.\n\n3.  **Confirm the Fraction using a Python script:**\n    Let's quickly calculate `sin²(30°)` to be certain.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Angle in degrees for which we want to find the power fraction\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert the angle to radians for use in numpy's sin function\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n\n# The radiated power is proportional to sin(theta)^2.\n# The maximum power (A) is at theta=90 degrees, where sin(90)^2 = 1.\n# The fraction of the maximum power at a given angle theta is sin(theta)^2 / sin(90)^2, which simplifies to sin(theta)^2.\nfraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power radiated at {theta_deg} degrees is: {fraction}\")\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nThe fraction of maximum power radiated at 30 degrees is: 0.25000000000000006\n```\nThe output `0.25` confirms that the fraction is `1/4`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    *   Now, let's analyze the factor `C` from Step 2 to find its dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle is:\n        `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n        where `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   From this formula, we can see that the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency: `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`.\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πf = 2πc/λ`.\n    *   Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n        `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, a possible functional form for `f(θ, λ)` includes a term `λ⁻⁴`. This is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is fundamentally radiation from induced dipoles.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form of the function `f(θ, λ)` shows a dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   Comparing these findings with the given options:\n        *   A) 1/2, `λ⁻⁴` (Incorrect fraction)\n        *   B) 1/4, `λ⁻⁴` (Correct fraction and wavelength dependence)\n        *   C) 1/4, `λ⁻³` (Incorrect wavelength dependence)\n        *   D) 3/4, `λ⁻⁶` (Incorrect fraction and wavelength dependence)\n\n    The correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An oscillating spheroid acts as an oscillating electric dipole. The power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\nwhere θ is the angle with respect to the z-axis.\n\n1.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The maximum power (A) is radiated when sin²(θ) is maximum. This occurs at θ = 90°, where sin(90°) = 1 and sin²(90°) = 1.\n    So, A ∝ 1.\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at θ = 30°.\n    At θ = 30°, the power is proportional to sin²(30°).\n    sin(30°) = 1/2\n    sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = (k * sin²(30°)) / (k * sin²(90°)) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n2.  **Dependence on Wavelength (λ):**\n    The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency (ω) and the square of the dipole moment amplitude.\n    P ∝ ω⁴\n    Since frequency ω is related to wavelength λ by ω = 2πc/λ (where c is the speed of light), the power dependence on wavelength is:\n    P ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n    This λ⁻⁴ dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is essentially dipole radiation.\n    Therefore, a possible functional form for the radiated power f is proportional to λ⁻⁴.\n\nCombining both results, the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of f includes a λ⁻⁴ term. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
