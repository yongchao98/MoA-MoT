    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves a conservative force (Hook's law, `F=-kx`), so the total energy of the system is conserved.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy:** The total energy `E` in a relativistic system is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy `K` and its potential energy `U`.\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy is `K = (γ - 1)mc²`, where `γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   The potential energy of a spring is `U = (1/2)kx²`.\n    *   Therefore, the total conserved energy is `E = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx²`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the system at the point of maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    *   At the maximum displacement `A`, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity `v = 0`.\n    *   When `v=0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1/√(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n    *   The kinetic energy `K` is `(1-1)mc² = 0`.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: `U_max = (1/2)kA²`.\n    *   The total energy of the system is `E_total = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA²`. Since total energy is conserved, this value is constant throughout the motion.\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at the equilibrium point (x = 0):**\n    *   At the equilibrium position `x=0`, the potential energy is zero: `U = 0`.\n    *   The mass is moving at its maximum speed, `v = v_max`.\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: `K_max = (γ_max - 1)mc²`, where `γ_max = 1/√(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    *   The total energy at this point is `E_total = K_max + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc²`.\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation of energy:** Equate the total energy from step 3 and step 4.\n    *   `E_total (at x=A) = E_total (at x=0)`\n    *   `(1/2)kA² = (γ_max - 1)mc²`\n\n6.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    *   First, isolate the term `γ_max`.\n    *   `γ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n    *   `γ_max = 1 + kA² / (2mc²)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n    *   `1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + kA² / (2mc²)`\n\n    *   To solve for `v_max`, we perform algebraic manipulations. First, square both sides of the equation:\n    *   `1 / (1 - v_max²/c²) = (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    *   Invert both sides:\n    *   `1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    *   Isolate the `v_max` term:\n    *   `v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    *   Multiply by `c²` and take the square root of both sides to find `v_max`:\n    *   `v_max = c√(1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression matches option D exactly.\n\nTo verify, let's consider the non-relativistic limit where the potential energy is much smaller than the rest energy (`kA² ≪ mc²`).\nLet `ε = kA² / (2mc²) ≪ 1`.\n`v_max = c√(1 - 1 / (1 + ε)²) = c√(1 - (1 + ε)⁻²)`.\nUsing the binomial approximation `(1 + x)ⁿ ≈ 1 + nx` for small `x`:\n`v_max ≈ c√(1 - (1 - 2ε)) = c√(2ε)`.\nSubstituting `ε` back:\n`v_max ≈ c√(2 * (kA² / (2mc²))) = c√(kA²/ (mc²)) = c * (A/c) * √(k/m) = A√(k/m) = √(kA²/m)`.\nThis is the classical result `(1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA²`, confirming our derivation is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
