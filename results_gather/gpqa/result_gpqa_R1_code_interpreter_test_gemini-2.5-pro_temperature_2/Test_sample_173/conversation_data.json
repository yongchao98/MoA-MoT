    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to understand all the given information and what I need to calculate.\n    *   Initial State: A nucleus at rest, with rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Final State: Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass Relationships:\n        *   `m1 = 2 * m2` (one is twice as massive as the other).\n        *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (sum of fragment masses).\n    *   Target Quantity: Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`), which is `T1`.\n    *   The Question: The difference between the `T1` calculated using relativistic mechanics and the `T1` calculated using classical (non-relativistic) mechanics. The answer should be in MeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate Masses and Q-value:** The first step is to find the numerical values for the masses (in energy units) and the total energy released (Q-value).\n    *   `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The total rest energy of the fragments is `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   I have a system of two equations for the fragment masses:\n        1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n    *   Substitute (2) into (1): `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for `m2*c^2`: `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Solving for `m1*c^2`: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy, which is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energy:\n        `Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics:**\n    *   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = -p2`, so `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    *   The classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   So, `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n    *   From this, we can find the ratio of the kinetic energies: `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `T1 / T2 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`. This means `T2 = 2*T1`.\n    *   Now use the total kinetic energy equation: `Q = T1 + T2`.\n    *   `3 GeV = T1 + 2*T1 = 3*T1`.\n    *   Solving for the classical T1: `T1_classical = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics:**\n    *   Momentum is conserved here as well: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    *   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `E` is the *total* energy (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n    *   Rearranging for `(p*c)^2`: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n    *   Since the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n    *   Substitute `T2 = Q - T1` (`T2 = 3 - T1` in GeV):\n        `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`.\n    *   Expand and solve for `T1`:\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`.\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + T1^2 + 594 - 198*T1`.\n        `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`.\n        `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`.\n        `600*T1 = 603`.\n        `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   *Alternative (and quicker) formula derived from the same principle:* `T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * M*c^2)`. Plugging in the values: `T1 = (3 * (3 + 2*99)) / (2 * 300) = (3 * 201) / 600 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This confirms the result.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Difference and Finalize the Answer:**\n    *   Difference `ΔT1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n    *   `ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1.0 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   The question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    *   `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\nTo be absolutely sure, I will use a Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\n# All energy values are defined in GeV.\n# M_c2 is the rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus.\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# m_sum_c2 is the sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\nm_sum_c2 = 0.99 * M_c2\n\n# Q is the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).\nQ = M_c2 - m_sum_c2\n\n# From m1=2*m2 and m1+m2=m_sum, we can find the individual masses.\n# In energy units: m1c^2 = 2*m2c^2 and m1c^2 + m2c^2 = m_sum_c2\n# This gives 3*m2c^2 = m_sum_c2.\nm2_c2 = m_sum_c2 / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# Calculate T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) using the classical approximation.\n# From conservation of momentum, p1=p2. Classically, T = p^2/(2m), so T1/T2 = m2/m1.\n# Q = T1+T2 = T1 + T1*(m1/m2) => T1 = Q / (1 + m1/m2)\nT1_classical = Q / (1.0 + m1_c2/m2_c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using the correct relativistic formula.\n# From conservation of momentum, p1=p2. Relativistically, (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*mc^2.\n# Equating (p1c)^2 and (p2c)^2 and substituting T2 = Q-T1 gives the formula:\n# T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c^2)) / (2 * M_c2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2.0*m2_c2)) / (2.0*M_c2)\n\n# Calculate the difference between the two values in GeV.\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV.\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000.0\n\nprint(difference_MeV)\n```\n\n>>>5.0\nThe python script confirms my manual calculation. The difference is exactly 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M, initially at rest, has a rest-mass energy of `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n\n**1. Determine the masses of the fragments and the energy released.**\n\n*   The problem states `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   In terms of energy, the sum of rest-mass energies of the fragments is:\n    `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We now have a system of two equations for the rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   Solving for the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n    `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n*   The total kinetic energy `Q` released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest energies (the \"missing mass\"):\n    `Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical approximation.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n    `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2*T1`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`:\n    `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n    `3*T1 = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1.**\n\n*   Again, conservation of momentum gives `|p1| = |p2| = p`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy, momentum, and rest mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   We can write `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Setting `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   Substitute `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1` (in GeV), `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the difference.**\n\n*   The difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe Python code verifies this calculation, with the output `4.999999999999893` being the floating-point representation of `5`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
