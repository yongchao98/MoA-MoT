    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}\\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, `a` is the planet's semi-major axis, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}\\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}\\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that the albedos are the same ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving a simple relationship with the semi-major axes ($a_1$ and $a_2$):\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV):** The problem provides information from the RV method (Doppler shifts), which can be used to find the semi-major axes. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K_{star}$), for a planet in a circular orbit, is given by:\n    $K_{star} = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}+M_p} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star}+M_p)}{a}}$\n    Since the planets are detected by the transit method, the inclination `i` must be close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1. Also, the mass of the star ($M_{star}$) is much larger than the mass of the planets ($M_p$), so we can approximate $M_{star}+M_p \\approx M_{star}$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n6.  **Isolate the Semi-Major Axis:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a` or, more conveniently for our ratio, for $\\sqrt{a}$:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K_{star}}$\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this relationship back into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}} = \\frac{M_{p2}/K_{star2}}{M_{p1}/K_{star1}}$\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\times \\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}$\n\n8.  **Use the Doppler Shift Data:** The RV amplitude $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$), as $K_{star} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** We can now substitute all the given values and ratios into the equation for the temperature ratio:\n    - Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    - Doppler shift ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can perform this division.\n\n```python\n# Masses of the planets (in Earth masses)\nm_p1 = 7\nm_p2 = 5\n\n# Maximum Doppler shifts (in Angstroms)\nd_lambda1 = 0.03\nd_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = m_p2 / m_p1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the RV amplitudes (K_star1 / K_star2), which is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts\nk_star_ratio_1_over_2 = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by (M_p2/M_p1) * (K_star1/K_star2)\ntemp_ratio_1_over_2 = mass_ratio_2_over_1 * k_star_ratio_1_over_2\n\nprint(temp_ratio_1_over_2)\n```\n\n>>>0.5357142857142857\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe value 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's properties (temperature $T_{star}$ and radius $R_{star}$), the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis $a$), and its albedo (A):\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}\\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\n    To find the ratio of the temperatures of the two planets ($T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$), we divide their respective equations. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo (A), these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\n3.  **Relating Distance (a) to Radial Velocity (RV):**\n    The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K_{star}$) caused by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for $\\sqrt{a}$:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K_{star} \\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n    Since G and $M_{star}$ are the same for both planets, we can see the relationship:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K_{star}}$\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Temperature Ratio:**\n    We can now substitute this relationship into our temperature ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}} = \\frac{M_{p2}/K_{star2}}{M_{p1}/K_{star1}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}}\\right)$\n\n5.  **Using Doppler Shift Data:**\n    The radial velocity ($K_{star}$) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_{star1}}{K_{star2}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substituting this into our equation gives the final formula for the temperature ratio based on the provided data:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    -   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n    -   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
