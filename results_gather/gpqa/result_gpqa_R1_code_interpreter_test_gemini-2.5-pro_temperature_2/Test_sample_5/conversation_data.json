    "*   **1. Deconstruct the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n    *   `x = r cos(θ)`\n    *   `y = r sin(θ)`\n    *   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\n    From `x = r cos(θ)`, we can write `x^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ)`.\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (x^2)\n\n*   **2. Simplify the Cartesian Potential:**\n    Combine the terms with `x^2`:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n*   **3. Recognize the Form of the Potential:**\n    The potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    *   `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`\n    *   `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\n    This is the potential for a 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the total energy E of the system will be the sum of the energies from the independent motions in the x and y directions: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n*   **4. Determine the Energy Spectrum for Each Dimension:**\n    The energy levels for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential `V(q) = 1/2 mω^2q^2` are given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`, where `n = 0, 1, 2, ...` is the quantum number.\n\n    **For the x-direction:**\n    We have `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`. Let's match this to the form `1/2 m(ω_x)^2 x^2`.\n    1/2 m(ω_x)^2 = 2k\n    (ω_x)^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy for the x-motion is:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n    **For the y-direction:**\n    We have `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`. Let's match this to the form `1/2 m(ω_y)^2 y^2`.\n    1/2 m(ω_y)^2 = 1/2 k\n    (ω_y)^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy for the y-motion is:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **5. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}.\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **6. Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is `E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n    This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
