    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: The problem deals with the \"excitation\" of atoms in stellar photospheres. The question states we can assume Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels, an upper level ($N_u$) and a lower level ($N_l$):\n    $$ \\frac{N_u}{N_l} = \\frac{g_u}{g_l} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T)} $$\n    where:\n    *   $N_u/N_l$ is the ratio of the population of the upper energy level to the lower energy level. This ratio represents the \"excitation\".\n    *   $g_u$ and $g_l$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the upper and lower levels, respectively.\n    *   $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply to Both Stars**: We need to write the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let $T_1$ be the temperature of star_1 and $T_2$ be the temperature of star_2. The energy levels and their statistical weights are the same for the iron atoms in both stars.\n\n    *   For star_1:\n        $$ \\left(\\frac{N_u}{N_l}\\right)_1 = \\frac{g_u}{g_l} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_1)} $$\n    *   For star_2:\n        $$ \\left(\\frac{N_u}{N_l}\\right)_2 = \\frac{g_u}{g_l} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_2)} $$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Relationship**: The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Mathematically, this is:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{N_u}{N_l}\\right)_1 = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{N_u}{N_l}\\right)_2 $$\n\n5.  **Substitute and Simplify**: Now, we substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n    $$ \\frac{g_u}{g_l} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_1)} = 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{g_u}{g_l} e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_2)} \\right) $$\n    The term for the statistical weights, $g_u/g_l$, is common on both sides and cancels out:\n    $$ e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_1)} = 2 \\cdot e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_2)} $$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperatures**: To handle the exponential terms, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\ln\\left(e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_1)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(2 \\cdot e^{-\\Delta E / (k T_2)}\\right) $$\n    Using the logarithm properties $\\ln(e^x) = x$ and $\\ln(a \\cdot b) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$:\n    $$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_1} = \\ln(2) - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_2} $$\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate $\\ln(2)$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_1} = \\ln(2) $$\n    Factor out the common term $\\Delta E/k$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\n\n7.  **Incorporate Numerical Values**: The problem states the energy difference $\\Delta E$ is \"approximately $1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J\". The Boltzmann constant $k$ is $1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K. The use of \"approximately\" is a strong hint that these two values should be treated as numerically equal. Therefore, the ratio $\\Delta E / k$ is approximately 1.\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\approx \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} \\approx 1 \\text{ K} $$\n    When we substitute this value back into the equation, the factor becomes 1 (the units are handled by the temperature terms, making the overall expression dimensionless as required for the logarithm).\n    $$ (1) \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\n\n8.  **Final Result**: The final equation is:\n    $$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $$\n    This matches option B."
