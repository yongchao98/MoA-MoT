    "This problem is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime, there is a fundamental limit to how precisely its energy can be determined.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The relationship is given by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n    For practical calculations, we often use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for each state:** We need to find the inherent energy spread (ΔE) for each state due to its finite lifetime.\n\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   Reduced Planck constant in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s): ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime (τ₁) = Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime (τ₂) = Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolvability:** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be clearly distinguished or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E₂ - E₁|, must be significantly larger than their energy uncertainties. A common criterion is that the energy separation should be at least as large as the sum of their individual linewidths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂), or at the very least, larger than the broader of the two linewidths.\n\n    *   The broader linewidth is from the state with the shorter lifetime, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The sum of the linewidths is ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    Therefore, the required energy difference must be |E₂ - E₁| > ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** Let's compare this requirement with the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: Much smaller than the required 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: Much smaller than the required 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: Much smaller than the required 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This value is much larger than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷), so the energy levels would be very clearly resolved.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # s\ntau2 = 1e-8  # s\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using DeltaE = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The condition for the energy levels to be resolved is that their energy difference\n# must be greater than their linewidths.

    "The problem asks for the required energy difference to clearly distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes.\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle:** The ability to distinguish two energy levels is limited by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a state (Δt) to the inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The formula is approximately ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. This ΔE is often called the natural linewidth.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Linewidth for Each State:**\n    *   **Reduced Planck Constant (ħ):** Approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" their energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be significantly greater than the uncertainty in their energies. A common criterion for resolvability (like the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the energy separation should be at least as large as the broader of the two linewidths. In this case, the broader linewidth is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. For the levels to be *clearly* distinguished, the separation should be even larger.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   Let the required energy difference be ΔE_sep.\n    *   We need ΔE_sep > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n        *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n        *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would still be heavily overlapped and not distinguishable.\n        *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is significantly larger than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV). This separation is more than 1000 times the linewidth, so the energy levels can be very clearly resolved.\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script confirms this reasoning. The larger of the two energy uncertainties is 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Only option D, 10⁻⁴ eV, is greater than this value.\n\n<<<D>>>"
