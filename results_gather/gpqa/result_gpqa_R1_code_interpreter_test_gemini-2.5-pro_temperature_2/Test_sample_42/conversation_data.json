    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n\nThe molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents based on Relative Positions**\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring according to the description.\n*   **Parent group:** -COOH at C1.\n*   **\"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"** The 'para' position (1,4) to C1 is C4. So, the **methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\"** The 'ortho' positions (1,2) to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the **hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) groups are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is where.\n*   **\"A ... carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"** The 'meta' positions (1,3) to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the **carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are at C3 and C5**. We don't yet know which is where.\n\nSo far, the partial structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n*   {C2, C6}: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n*   {C3, C5}: -CHO and -CN\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Structure**\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"** ('Nitrile' is the -CN group; 'alcohol' is the -OH group).\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile, the nitrile (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile (-CN). Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The alcohol (-OH) must be ortho to C3 (i.e., at C2 or C4). Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the **alcohol (-OH) must be at C2**. This determines the positions of the other groups: the dimethylamino must be at C6, and the carbaldehyde must be at C5.\n        *   **Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The alcohol (-OH) must be ortho to C5 (i.e., at C4 or C6). Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the **alcohol (-OH) must be at C6**. This implies dimethylamino is at C2 and carbaldehyde is at C3.\n\nThe two cases result in mirror-image structures. IUPAC rules will determine a single correct name.\n*   **Structure from Case 1 (clockwise numbering):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n*   **Structure from Case 2 (counter-clockwise numbering):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\n*   **Rule 1:** The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. (Done).\n*   **Rule 2:** Number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (positions) to the substituents. In this fully substituted ring, both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering give the same locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Rule 3 (Tie-breaker):** When locant sets are identical, we give the lowest number to the substituent that appears first in alphabetical order. Let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n*   Now we compare the locants assigned to these substituents in the two numbering schemes, finding the first point of difference.\n    *   **Clockwise scheme (Case 1):** `cyano` is at C3, `dimethylamino` at C6, `formyl` at C5, `hydroxy` at C2, `methoxy` at C4. The locant set, ordered by the alphabetized prefixes, is **(3, 6, 5, 2, 4)**.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise scheme (Case 2):** `cyano` is at C5, `dimethylamino` at C2, `formyl` at C3, `hydroxy` at C6, `methoxy` at C4. The locant set, ordered by the alphabetized prefixes, is **(5, 2, 3, 6, 4)**.\n*   Compare the two sets: `(3, 6, 5, 2, 4)` versus `(5, 2, 3, 6, 4)`. At the first point of difference, **3 is less than 5**. Therefore, the clockwise numbering scheme (Case 1) is correct.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\n\nThe correct numbering and substituent positions are:\n*   C2: hydroxy\n*   C3: cyano\n*   C4: methoxy\n*   C5: formyl\n*   C6: dimethylamino\n\nTo write the name, list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **c**yano: **3-cyano**\n*   **d**imethylamino: **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses used for complex substituent names)\n*   **f**ormyl: **5-formyl**\n*   **h**ydroxy: **2-hydroxy**\n*   **m**ethoxy: **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these parts alphabetically gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
