    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene, and it is symmetric because the groups on both sides of the double bond are identical (propyl groups).\n    ```\n          H       H\n           \\     /\n      Pr--C === C--Pr   (where Pr = CH3CH2CH2-)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** mCPBA performs a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond to form an epoxide. The rule for stereochemistry is: a *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Attack from the \"top\" face gives one enantiomer.\n    *   Attack from the \"bottom\" face gives the other enantiomer.\n    The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring opening with aqueous acid (H3O+).** The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. A water molecule then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an SN2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition and an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n    *   **Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide:**\n        *   If water attacks C4 (which has R configuration), the configuration inverts to S. The configuration at C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. This molecule has opposite configurations at its two identical stereocenters, so it is a *meso* compound.\n        *   If water attacks C5 (which has R configuration), the configuration inverts to S. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is the same *meso* compound.\n    *   **Starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide:**\n        *   Attacking either C4 or C5 will also lead to the same *meso*-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is meso-octane-4,5-diol, which is an achiral molecule.\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, and it is also symmetric.\n    ```\n          Pr      Pr\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n          H       H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** A *cis*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition produces a *meso* compound (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   The product is meso-4,5-epoxyoctane, which has (4R,5S) configuration. It has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Ring opening with aqueous acid (H3O+).** Similar to Reaction 1, this is an *anti*-addition of water across the epoxide.\n    *   **Starting with meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide:**\n        *   If water attacks C4 (which has R configuration), the configuration inverts to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   If water attacks C5 (which has S configuration), the configuration inverts to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting meso-epoxide is symmetric, attacks at C4 and C5 are equally probable. This means the two enantiomeric products, (4S,5S) and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three compounds are stereoisomers.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Part 4: HPLC Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral chromatography columns separate molecules based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity, size, etc.).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus different interactions with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. They will be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The meso-diol will produce one peak. The racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will produce a second peak.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral chromatography columns contain a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Diastereomers are also separated on a chiral column (as they are on an achiral column).\n    *   **Observation:** The meso-diol will produce one peak. The (4R,5R)-diol will produce a second peak. The (4S,5S)-diol will produce a third, distinct peak.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 3\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
