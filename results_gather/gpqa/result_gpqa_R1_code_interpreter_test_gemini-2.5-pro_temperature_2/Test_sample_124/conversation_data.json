    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Hamiltonian:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n    The Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where each $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i=x,y,z$. Each of these is the Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalue for a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator is given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n    Since the 3D Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D Hamiltonians, the total energy eigenvalue is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers.\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy Levels and States:**\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy depends only on this sum $N$, so the energy levels can be written as:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n    *   **Ground State:** $N=0$. This is the lowest energy state.\n        *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$.\n        *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$.\n        *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. This is the state we are interested in.\n        *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy (Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions):**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$.\n    We need to find the number of ways to write $N=3$ as the sum of three non-negative integers.\n    The possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n    *   The state (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, this is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of ways to distribute $N$ identical items into $k$ distinct bins is given by the formula $\\binom{N+k-1}{k-1}$.\n    Here, $N=3$ (energy quanta) and $k=3$ (dimensions x, y, z).\n    Degeneracy $g_N = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    The energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The degeneracy of this state is 10.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10  (Incorrect energy)\n    B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3   (Incorrect energy and degeneracy)\n    C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3          (Incorrect degeneracy)\n    D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10         (Correct energy and degeneracy)\n\n<<<D>>>"
