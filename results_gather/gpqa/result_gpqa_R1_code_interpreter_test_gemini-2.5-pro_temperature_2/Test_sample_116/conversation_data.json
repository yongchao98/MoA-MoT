    "To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, we need to identify which of them are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial, planar, or helical chirality. Molecules that are achiral (superimposable on their mirror image) do not show optical isomerism. Achiral molecules often possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyl molecules consist of two benzene rings joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings can be restricted by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6'). In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃) and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n    *   This steric hindrance forces the rings into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry in this twisted state. Since the substituents on each ring are different at the ortho positions (-COOCH₃ at C2/C2' and -NO₂ at C6/C6'), the molecule as a whole lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This type of chirality due to restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 2 (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since C2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. It will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is diphenyl ketone, (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule has no chiral centers. It possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, a plane of symmetry can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. Also, a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1 is chiral (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2 is chiral (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3 is achiral.\n*   Compound 4 is achiral.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option C.\n\nTo computationally verify this analysis, a Python script using the RDKit cheminformatics library can be used to identify potential chirality in the molecules.\n\n```python\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n\ndef shows_optical_isomerism(smiles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a molecule can show optical isomerism (i.e., is chiral)\n    by detecting potential stereocenters (atomic, axial, etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n        if mol is None: return False\n\n        # Find stereocenters based on connectivity\n        # includeUnassigned=True is crucial for finding potential centers in a flat SMILES string\n        centers = Chem.FindMolChiralCenters(mol, includeUnassigned=True)\n        if len(centers) > 0:\n            return True\n\n        # For cases like atropisomers, a 3D structure is often needed for detection\n        try:\n            mol_3d = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n            # Use a robust embedding algorithm\n            if AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol_3d, useRandomCoords=True, maxAttempts=10) == -1:\n                # If embedding fails, fall back to initial check\n                return False\n            # Assign stereochemistry from the generated 3D conformation\n            Chem.AssignStereochemistryFrom3D(mol_3d)\n            centers_3d = Chem.FindMolChiralCenters(mol_3d, includeUnassigned=True)\n            if len(centers_3d) > 0:\n                return True\n        except:\n            # Catch any errors during 3D generation\n            return False\n\n        return False\n\n    except Exception:\n        return False\n\n# SMILES strings for the four compounds\nsmiles_dict = {\n    \"1\": \"COC(=O)c1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)c2c(C(=O)OC)cccc2N(=O)=O\",\n    \"2\": \"CC(O)C(=O)OC\",\n    \"3\": \"c1ccccc1C(=O)c2ccccc2\",\n    \"4\": \"COC(=O)/C=C/C(=O)OC\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Checking for optical isomerism:\")\nresults = []\nfor i in range(1, 5):\n    key = str(i)\n    is_chiral = shows_optical_isomerism(smiles_dict[key])\n    results.append(is_chiral)\n    print(f\"Compound {key}: {'Shows optical isomerism' if is_chiral else 'Does NOT show optical isomerism'}\")\n\n# Determine which option is correct based on the results\nif results[0] and results[1] and not results[2] and not results[3]:\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

    "My initial thinking process led to the conclusion that compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, while 3 and 4 do not. This was based on the principles of stereochemistry. The generated Python code, however, returned a result indicating that compound 1 does not show optical isomerism, contradicting my initial analysis. Let's re-evaluate.\n\n**Re-evaluation of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** My initial analysis identified this as a classic case of **atropisomerism**. This occurs in substituted biphenyls where bulky ortho-substituents prevent free rotation around the central C-C bond, locking the molecule into a non-planar, chiral conformation. In this case, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are all substituted with large groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃), causing significant steric hindrance. The resulting twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. Therefore, it should exhibit optical isomerism. The Python script's failure to detect this highlights a limitation of simple computational checks; detecting atropisomerism often requires more sophisticated conformational analysis or explicit stereochemical information that wasn't provided in the basic SMILES string. The chemical principle is robust: this compound is indeed chiral.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** As analyzed before, the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃ contains a chiral center at the second carbon, which is bonded to four distinct groups (-H, -OH, -CH₃, -COOCH₃). The molecule is chiral and shows optical isomerism. The code correctly identified this.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** (C₆H₅)₂CO. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry. It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. The code correctly identified this.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** The *trans* configuration CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ has a center of inversion and is planar. It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. The code correctly identified this.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nMy re-evaluation confirms the initial analysis based on chemical principles. The computational result for compound 1 was a false negative due to the complexity of detecting atropisomerism programmatically. Compounds 1 and 2 are the ones that show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 1:** Shows optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n*   **Compound 2:** Shows optical isomerism due to a chiral carbon center.\n*   **Compound 3:** Achiral.\n*   **Compound 4:** Achiral.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
