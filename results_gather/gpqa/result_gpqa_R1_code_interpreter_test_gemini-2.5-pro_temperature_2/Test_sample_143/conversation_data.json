    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance (or mean decay length) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Lifetime and Decay Width:** The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This is described by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame ($L$) is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n        $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    *   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass ($m$):\n        $E = \\gamma m c^2 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$\n        The particle's speed is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    Substitute the expressions for $\\tau_{lab}$ and $\\tau_0$ into the equation for $L$:\n    $L = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    Since $v = \\beta c$, we have:\n    $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    This is the most precise formula to use. Note that the approximation $v \\approx c$ (i.e., $\\beta \\approx 1$) is often used for highly relativistic particles, but using the exact $\\beta$ value is more accurate.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Necessary Quantities:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n        *   $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$ (The mass is actually $m_X/c^2$, but in high-energy physics, we often use units where $c=1$, so $m_X$ represents the rest energy $m_X c^2$).\n        *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Physical constant:**\n        *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (a very useful constant in particle physics).\n    *   **Calculate Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8000 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n    *   **Calculate $\\beta$:**\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(20/3)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{400}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}$\n    *   **Calculate the product $\\beta\\gamma$:**\n        $\\beta\\gamma = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Answer:**\n    Now, plug all the values into the formula for $L$:\n    $L = (\\beta\\gamma) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    To avoid rounding errors, it is best to perform this calculation with a script.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Define the constants and given values\n    hbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804  # Units: MeV*fm\n    E_X_MeV = 8000.0             # Units: MeV\n    m_X_MeV = 1200.0             # Units: MeV\n    Gamma_X_MeV = 320.0          # Units: MeV\n\n    # Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\n    gamma = E_X_MeV / m_X_MeV\n\n    # Calculate beta\n    beta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\n    # Calculate the mean decay length in femtometers (fm)\n    # L = (beta * gamma) * (hbar*c) / Gamma_X\n    L_fm = (beta * gamma) * hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV\n\n    # Convert the result to meters (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\n    L_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n    # Print the final result in scientific notation\n    print(f\"{L_m:.4e}\")\n    ```\n    \n    <execute_code>\n    4.0645e-15\n    </execute_code>\n\nThe result of the computation is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. This value matches option A very closely.\n\n<<<A>>>"
