    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude, K.\n    The relationship is given by the Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{K}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$.\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit around a star of mass $M_{star}$ with a period T, the RV semi-amplitude K can be derived. The key dependencies are:\n    - The star's velocity is proportional to the planet's velocity ($v_{star} \\propto v_p$).\n    - The planet's velocity is $v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a_p}{T}$, where $a_p$ is the orbital radius.\n    - Kepler's Third Law states $T^2 \\propto a_p^3 / M_{star}$, which means $a_p \\propto (M_{star} T^2)^{1/3}$.\n    - Combining these, we find that the planet's velocity $v_p \\propto \\frac{(M_{star} T^2)^{1/3}}{T} \\propto M_{star}^{1/3} T^{-1/3}$.\n    - The star's velocity amplitude K is also proportional to the planet's mass $m_p$ and inversely proportional to the star's mass $M_{star}$.\n    The full formula for K (assuming $m_p \\ll M_{star}$) is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Set up the Proportionality:**\n    The problem states that for both systems:\n    - The star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    - The planet masses are the same ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).\n    The problem does not mention the orbital inclination, $i$. For such problems, we assume the conditions are comparable, which means we can assume the inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$). Alternatively, the phrase \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" can be interpreted as the measured minimum mass ($m_p \\sin i$) being the same for both planets. In either case, the term $m_p \\sin i$ is a constant factor for both systems.\n    With $M_{star}$, $m_p$, and $\\sin i$ being the same for both planets, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find the Ratio of Periods:**\n    We are given the wavelength shifts:\n    - $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    - $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Since $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n    Now, we use the proportionality from step 3:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    Substitute the value of the K ratio:\n    $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($T_2/T_1$):**\n    To solve for $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n    $(1.4)^{-3} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}\\right)^{-3}$\n    $\\frac{1}{1.4^3} = \\frac{T_2}{T_1}$\n\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value.\n    $1.4^3 = 1.4 \\times 1.4 \\times 1.4 = 1.96 \\times 1.4 = 2.744$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\n    Let's perform the final division.\n```python\nprint(1 / (1.4**3))\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.364. This matches option B.\n\nA quick sanity check: Planet #2 induces a larger velocity shift in its star ($K_2 > K_1$). A larger stellar wobble for the same planet mass implies the planet is orbiting faster and closer. A faster orbit means a shorter period. Therefore, we expect $T_2$ to be shorter than $T_1$, and the ratio $T_2/T_1$ to be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n\n<<<B>>>",
