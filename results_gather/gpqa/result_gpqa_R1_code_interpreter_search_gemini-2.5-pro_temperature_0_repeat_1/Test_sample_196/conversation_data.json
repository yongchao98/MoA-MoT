    "**1. Analysis of Compound X Structure from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** The broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region represent a total of four protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** We need to determine the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is part of an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to both the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine proton (at 2.9 ppm), hence it appears as a multiplet.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine proton (-CH-). It is attached directly to the aromatic ring (causing the downfield shift), and it is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The alkyl group has a methine carbon attached to the ring, a methyl group, and an ethyl group. This is a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: The -COOH at position 1 is converted to -CH₃. The sec-butyl group at position 4 is unchanged.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the identified final product with the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **This matches our result.**\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect isomer.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
