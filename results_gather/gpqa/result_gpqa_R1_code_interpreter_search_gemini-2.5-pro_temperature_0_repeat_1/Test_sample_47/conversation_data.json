    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to substitute a hydrogen atom on one of the α-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-carbons are equivalent. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone and a strong base (NaOH) with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reactants and conditions (an α-halo ketone with an enolizable proton on the other α-carbon, treated with a strong base) is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate called a cyclopropanone (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The three-membered ring opens to relieve strain, leading to a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (during aqueous workup) yields a carboxylic acid with a contracted ring.\n*   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *(Note: A simple E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible, but the subsequent reactions are less plausible with the given reagents. The Favorskii rearrangement provides a much more consistent chemical pathway.)*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The acid chloride is reduced to an aldehyde. The final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\n**Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in the final product, cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry and Chirality:**\n    *   The carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a **chiral center**.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, C1, and the C1-H bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring (assuming a time-averaged, planar representation for NMR purposes).\n    *   This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5, and the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Environments:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **Proton on C1:** This proton is attached to the chiral center and is also unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic because they are on a carbon adjacent to a chiral center (C1). This means they are chemically non-equivalent and would produce two different signals in an NMR spectrum. Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C5 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. Thus, this gives us two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n    4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic because of their relationship to the chiral center C1. They are chemically non-equivalent. The protons on C4 are equivalent to their counterparts on C3 by symmetry. This gives us another two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n    *   C1-H: 1 type\n    *   C2/C5 Protons: 2 types\n    *   C3/C4 Protons: 2 types\n    *   Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
