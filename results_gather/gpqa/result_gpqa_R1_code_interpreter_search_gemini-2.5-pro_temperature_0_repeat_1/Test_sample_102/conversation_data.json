    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern). This is a key feature that will guide the synthesis strategy.\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical because existing substituents direct the position of new ones.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. (This group appears in the reaction sequences via reduction of a nitro group).\n\n**3. Evaluate a Simple, Direct Synthesis Route**\n\nA logical approach for a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product would be to introduce *meta*-directing groups first.\nLet's consider a simple 3-step synthesis:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position. This is a standard, high-yield reaction.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. This reaction should be highly regioselective.\n\nThis 3-step route is efficient and should give a high yield. However, it is not listed as an option. The options provided are all 7 steps long, suggesting a more complex strategy is required, likely to overcome a subtle problem in the simpler routes or to test knowledge of more advanced synthetic transformations.\n\nLet's consider another simple route: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration.\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. (The acetyl group directs bromine to the *meta* position).\n3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → ?\n    *   In 3-bromoacetophenone, the acetyl group (-COCH3 at C1) is a *meta*-director (directs to C5).\n    *   The bromo group (-Br at C3) is an *ortho, para*-director (directs to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   The directing effects are in conflict. Experimental data shows that this reaction gives a mixture of products, with 3-bromo-6-nitroacetophenone being the major product, not the desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. Therefore, this direct route does not provide a high yield of the target molecule.\n\nThis explains why a more complex route is needed. The options likely use a \"temporary directing group\" strategy.\n\n**4. Analyze the Provided Options**\n\nThe presence of the sequence `Fe/HCl` (reduction of -NO2 to -NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization of -NH2), and `H3PO2` (deamination, i.e., removal of the amino group) is a strong indicator of a strategy where an amino group is used to direct substitutions and is then removed.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2... This sequence starts by making aniline and then immediately removes the amino group with H3PO2, returning to benzene. This is illogical.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3... This attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base that reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3... This sequence creates p-nitrobromobenzene and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    Let's trace this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.**\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group directs the bromine *meta*.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Bromo-6-nitroacetophenone.** As discussed, this nitration is not selective for the desired 5-position. The major product is the 6-nitro isomer. The synthesis proceeds using this major isomer.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Bromo-6-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl → 6-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). This -NH2 group is a powerful *ortho, para*-director and will be used to control the next substitution.\n    5.  **v) 6-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 6-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.** This is the crucial step. We are nitrating the ring again.\n        *   The amino group at C6 is a strong *o,p*-director, directing to C5.\n        *   The acetyl group at C1 is a *m*-director, also directing to C5.\n        *   With two groups strongly directing the incoming nitro group to the same position (C5), this reaction is highly regioselective.\n    6.  **vi) 6-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.** The amino group at C6 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis complex sequence successfully overcomes the regioselectivity problem of the direct nitration by introducing a temporary nitro group, converting it to a powerful amino directing group to install the second nitro group correctly, and then removing the temporary directing group. This is a valid and elegant synthetic strategy.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the other options which contain fatal flaws and by tracing the logical (though complex) steps of Option D, we can conclude it is the correct sequence for the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>"
