    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process typically requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n\n1.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone has a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O (ketone) groups opposite each other.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons are themselves part of the ring's C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized and are bonded to other carbons within the ring, not to hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its related di-enol form (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction, not a simple tautomeric shift. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has a six-membered saturated ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons, located between the carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they each have two alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism (B)**\n\n**Concept:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image (an enantiomer). Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a *trans* configuration around the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to these elements of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. Achiral molecules are superimposable on their mirror images and do not exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
