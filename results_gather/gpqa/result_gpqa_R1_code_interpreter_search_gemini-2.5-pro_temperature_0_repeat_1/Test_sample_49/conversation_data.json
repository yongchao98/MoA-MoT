    "This problem requires us to determine the number of loops in a Feynman diagram from a mathematical expression that represents a \"size estimate\" of its contribution. The expression is:\n\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nLet's break down the typical structure of an expression resulting from a Feynman diagram calculation in quantum field theory. It generally consists of four parts:\n1.  **Coupling Constants:** These represent the strength of the interactions. Here, they are `alpha^3` and `g^2`. This tells us that the diagram involves vertices corresponding to these couplings. The total power of the couplings is related to the number of vertices in the diagram.\n2.  **Numerical Factors:** These can arise from various sources, such as symmetry factors of the diagram, group theory factors from the specific gauge group, or results of performing traces over Dirac or other matrices. In this expression, `sqrt(2) * 8` are such factors.\n3.  **Kinematic Factors:** These depend on the external momenta and masses of the particles involved. The term `(Q/M)^2` is a typical example, representing a ratio of energy scales (e.g., momentum transfer `Q` to a particle mass `M`).\n4.  **Loop Factors:** When calculating loop diagrams, each loop corresponds to an integral over an undetermined momentum (a \"loop momentum\"). In a four-dimensional spacetime, using the standard technique of dimensional regularization, each loop integral contributes a characteristic factor of `1 / (16 * pi^2)`, which can be written as `1 / (4 * pi)^2`.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in identifying the loop factor and relating it to the number of loops.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram.\nThe standard factor associated with an `L`-loop calculation in four-dimensional spacetime is:\n`(1 / (4 * pi)^2)^L = 1 / (4 * pi)^(2L)`\n\nNow, let's look at the expression given in the problem:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe factor containing `4pi` is `1/(4pi)^6`. This is the loop factor.\n\nWe can now equate the general form of the loop factor with the one from the expression:\n`1 / (4 * pi)^(2L) = 1 / (4 * pi)^6`\n\nBy comparing the exponents in the denominator, we get the equation:\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`, we find:\n`L = 6 / 2 = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops. The other parts of the expression, while realistic for a diagram calculation, are not needed to determine the loop number. The power of `1/(4pi)` is the most direct signature of the loop order.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
