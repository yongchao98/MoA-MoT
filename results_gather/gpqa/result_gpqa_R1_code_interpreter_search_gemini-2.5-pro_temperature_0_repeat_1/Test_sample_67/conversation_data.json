    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|↑>_z`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|↓>_z`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B` and `E_down = -γ(-ħ/2)B = +γ(ħ/2)B`.\n*   The lowest energy state is the \"spin up\" state. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |↑>_z`. In the standard basis where `|↑>_z = [1, 0]` and `|↓>_z = [0, 1]`, we have `|ψ(0)> = [1, 0]`.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B' = B ĵ`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B' = -γS_y B`.\n*   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, governed by this new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n\n### 3. Method 1: Larmor Precession (Heisenberg Picture)\n\nThis is the most intuitive way to solve the problem.\n\n*   The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` is given by `d<S>/dt = γ<S> × B'`.\n*   This equation describes the precession of the spin vector `<S>` around the magnetic field `B'`.\n*   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γ|B'| = γB`.\n*   At `t=0`, the spin is pointing in the +Z direction: `<S>(0) = (ħ/2) k̂`. The new magnetic field is in the +Y direction: `B' = B ĵ`.\n*   The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n*   The z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, is the projection of the precessing spin vector onto the Z-axis. As the vector rotates in the X-Z plane, its Z-component will oscillate between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the precession frequency, `ω = ω_L = γB`.\n*   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`. Since `<S_z>` oscillates with frequency `γB`, `<μ_z>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\n### 4. Method 2: Solving the Schrödinger Equation (Schrödinger Picture)\n\nThis method is more formal and confirms the result from the precession argument.\n\n*   **Find Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian:** We need to find the eigenstates of `H = -γBS_y`. This is equivalent to finding the eigenstates of `S_y`. The Pauli matrix for `S_y` is `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y = (ħ/2)[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_y` are:\n        *   `|↑>_y` (spin up along y) with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n        *   `|↓>_y` (spin down along y) with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of `H` are:\n        *   `E_↑y = -γB(ħ/2)`\n        *   `E_↓y = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n\n*   **Express Initial State in the New Basis:** We need to write the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |↑>_z` as a combination of `|↑>_y` and `|↓>_y`.\n    *   The y-eigenstates can be written in the z-basis as:\n        *   `|↑>_y = (1/√2)(|↑>_z + i|↓>_z)`\n        *   `|↓>_y = (1/√2)(|↑>_z - i|↓>_z)`\n    *   By adding these two equations, we can solve for `|↑>_z`:\n        *   `|↑>_y + |↓>_y = (2/√2)|↑>_z = √2 |↑>_z`\n        *   `|↑>_z = (1/√2)(|↑>_y + |↓>_y)`\n    *   So, the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2)|↑>_y + (1/√2)|↓>_y`.\n\n*   **Time Evolution:** Now we apply the time evolution operator.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2)exp(-iE_↑y t/ħ)|↑>_y + (1/√2)exp(-iE_↓y t/ħ)|↓>_y`\n    *   Substituting the energy values:\n        *   `exp(-iE_↑y t/ħ) = exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ) = exp(iγBt/2)`\n        *   `exp(-iE_↓y t/ħ) = exp(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ) = exp(-iγBt/2)`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2)[exp(iγBt/2)|↑>_y + exp(-iγBt/2)|↓>_y]`\n\n*   **Calculate the Expectation Value `<μ_z>(t)`:** We need to calculate `<ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   The operator `S_z` in the y-basis is `S_z = (ħ/2)(|↑>_y<↓|_y + |↓>_y<↑|_y)`.\n    *   `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n    *   The calculation yields:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) [ (1/√2)exp(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)exp(-iγBt/2) + (1/√2)exp(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)exp(iγBt/2) ]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * (1/2) * [exp(-iγBt) + exp(iγBt)]`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/4) * [2cos(γBt)] = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   Therefore, `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates according to `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
