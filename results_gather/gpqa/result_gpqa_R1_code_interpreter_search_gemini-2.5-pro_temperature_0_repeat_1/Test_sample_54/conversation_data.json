    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signals:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** This means the 3 protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal is a classic signature for an acetate methyl group (-O-C(=O)-**CH₃**). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, likely a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This means the methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-CH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methyl group on a double bond, coupled to a vinyl proton.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"doublet\" part means it's coupled to one adjacent proton. The \"quartet\" part means it's coupled to an adjacent methyl group (3 protons).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a vinyl proton (-CH=) that is adjacent to another vinyl proton and a methyl group. This matches the structure `CH₃-CH=`.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. It is significantly downfield (higher ppm) because the carbon it's attached to is also bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom (`=CH-O-`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   **J-value (16.0 Hz):** This is the coupling constant between this proton and the one it's coupled to.\n\n**2. Piece the Structure Together:**\n\n*   From the signals, we have identified an acetate group (`-O-C(=O)-CH₃`) and a propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=CH-`).\n*   The total number of protons from the data is 3H (acetate) + 3H (methyl) + 1H (vinyl) + 1H (vinyl) = 8 protons.\n*   Let's check the molecular formulas:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂): 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This matches.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂): Has 10 protons. This does not match.\n*   Therefore, the compound must be either Cis- or Trans-**propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n*   The key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two protons on the double bond.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the coupling between the two vinyl protons.\n*   **Rule of thumb for vinyl coupling constants:**\n    *   **Trans coupling (J_trans):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   **Cis coupling (J_cis):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n*   The observed J-value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Final Identification:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The molecule is a **propenyl acetate**.\n*   The geometry of the double bond is **trans**.\n\nThe unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
