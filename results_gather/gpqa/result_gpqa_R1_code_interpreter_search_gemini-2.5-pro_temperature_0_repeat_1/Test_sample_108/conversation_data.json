    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe intrinsic parity of a nucleon is `+1`. The total parity of the initial two-nucleon system is given by `P_i = (P_N1) * (P_N2) * (-1)^L_i = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nAccording to the generalized Pauli principle for two nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, which means `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, where T is the total isospin. For the initial state:\n*   `L_i = 0`, `S_i = 0`.\n*   `(-1)^(0+0+T_i) = -1`, which implies `(-1)^T_i = -1`.\n*   Therefore, the isospin of the initial state must be `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `NN(1S0)` with `J_i=0`, `P_i=+1`, `T_i=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Decay Process and Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay process is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The final `NN_f` state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n*   The lowercase letter (`s, p, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X, which we'll call `L_X`.\n\nWe must apply the following conservation laws and principles:\n\n**A. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`L_X`).\n`vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(L_X)`\nSince `J_i = 0`, we must have `vec(J_f) + vec(L_X) = 0`. This implies that the vectors must have equal magnitude and opposite direction. Therefore, their magnitudes must be equal:\n`J_f = L_X`\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity (P):**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n`P_i = P_f`\n`P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^L_X`.\n*   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f` (where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state).\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\nSo, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = -(-1)^(L_f + L_X)`.\nFor parity to be conserved, `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + L_X)`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + L_X) = -1`. This means the sum `L_f + L_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**C. Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nSince we are given that the final state has `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. (This is consistent with the generalized Pauli principle `L+S+T` must be odd, since `L_f+S_f+0` being odd means `L_f+S_f` is odd).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each option against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`?  `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` state): `L_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. This is even. (FAIL)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` state): `L_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D state). `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `L_X=1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. S=3 is physically impossible. This makes the transition forbidden because the final state cannot exist. However, for completeness, we apply the rules given in the problem.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Conclusion: This transition satisfies all the conservation laws and the specific Pauli rule given. The reason it is forbidden is the non-existence of the `S=3` state for two nucleons, which is a more fundamental constraint not explicitly listed in the rules to be checked.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the options, the transition in option (B) is the only one that fails the explicit criteria laid out in the problem (specifically, the Pauli statistics rule). The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the stated conservation laws and the given Pauli rule. Option (B) is the one that fails this test.\n\n<<<B>>>"
