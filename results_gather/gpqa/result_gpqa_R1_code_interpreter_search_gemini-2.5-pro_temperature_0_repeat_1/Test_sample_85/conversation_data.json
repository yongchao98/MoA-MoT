    "This problem requires understanding the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and how they react with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. The stereochemistry of the starting materials and products must also be considered.\n\n### **Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:**\n    The product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at the C4 position, which bears an ethyl group. The formation of this lactone implies that the precursor molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative thereof) that undergoes intramolecular cyclization. The chiral center at C4 of the lactone corresponds to the chiral center at C3 of the open-chain precursor, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n    *   Product of Reaction 1: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   Product of Reaction 2: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Materials:**\n    The options provided are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's draw its structure:\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂\n    This molecule has two reducible functional groups:\n    *   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end.\n    *   An isobutyl ester (-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂) at the other end.\n    The chiral center is at C3, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reactions:**\n    We need to consider the specific reactivity (chemoselectivity) of each reducing agent.\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n        *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids.\n        *   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of the starting material, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n            HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOR'  + LiBH₄  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n            (where R' = isobutyl)\n        *   The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        *   **Lactonization:** In the presence of acid (H⁺ workup), this 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone.\n        *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the final product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n        *   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n        *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters.\n        *   **Reaction Pathway:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material, leaving the ester group intact.\n            HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOR'  + BH₃  →  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOR'\n            (where R' = isobutyl)\n        *   The intermediate formed is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        *   **Lactonization:** In the presence of acid (H⁺ workup), this 5-hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the same six-membered lactone.\n        *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained in the final product. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n        *   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis:\n    *   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    *   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
