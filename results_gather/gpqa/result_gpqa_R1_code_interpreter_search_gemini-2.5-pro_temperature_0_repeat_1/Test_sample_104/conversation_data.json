    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim:\n1.  **Rotational Modulation:** A star with a cool, dark, spotted hemisphere rotating, causing its observed brightness to dip when the spotted side faces us.\n2.  **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of a star, blocking a fraction of its light.\n\nWe need to find the size of a hypothetical planet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would cause the same brightness dip as the rotating spotted star.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starspot Scenario**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots.\n\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `Teff = 6000 K`.\n    *   Temperature of the spots, `Tspot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   Filling factor of spots on the dark hemisphere, `f_spot = 20% = 0.20`.\n\n*   **Flux Calculation:**\n    The brightness or flux (`F`) of a star is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit surface area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T^4`).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):**\n    This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature of `Teff`. We can represent this flux as being proportional to `Teff^4`.\n    `F_max ∝ Teff^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):**\n    This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. On this side, a fraction `f_spot` (0.20) of the area is at the cooler temperature `Tspot`, and the remaining fraction `(1 - f_spot)` (0.80) is at the normal temperature `Teff`. The total flux is the weighted average of the flux from these two areas.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * Teff^4 + f_spot * Tspot^4`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:**\n    The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux, calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n    `Amplitude = (Teff^4 - [ (1 - f_spot) * Teff^4 + f_spot * Tspot^4 ]) / Teff^4`\n\n    Let's simplify this expression:\n    `Amplitude = (Teff^4 - Teff^4 + f_spot * Teff^4 - f_spot * Tspot^4) / Teff^4`\n    `Amplitude = (f_spot * Teff^4 - f_spot * Tspot^4) / Teff^4`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - Tspot^4 / Teff^4)`\n    `Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4)`\n\n*   **Numerical Calculation:**\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * ( (1296 - 625) / 1296 )`\n    `Amplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177`\n    `Amplitude ≈ 0.1035`\n\nSo, the star's brightness dips by about 10.35% due to the spots.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Exoplanet Transit Scenario**\n\nNext, let's model the brightness dip caused by an exoplanet transit.\n\n*   **Transit Depth:**\n    When a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The depth of this transit (the fractional drop in brightness) is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    `Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star`\n    `Transit Depth = (π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2)`\n    `Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n    where `Rpl` is the planet's radius and `Rstar` is the star's radius.\n\n### **4. Equate the Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the spots is the same as the transit depth from the hypothetical planet.\n\n`Transit Depth = Amplitude`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = 0.1035`\n\nTo find the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar`, we take the square root of the amplitude:\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.1035)`\n`Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3217`\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32. This matches option A.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters from the problem\nTeff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nTspot = 5000 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin (1000K difference)\nf_spot = 0.20 # Filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots.\n# The formula for the relative amplitude is f_spot * (1 - (Tspot/Teff)^4).\namplitude = f_spot * (1 - (Tspot / Teff)**4)\n\n# Step 2: The amplitude is equal to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# The transit depth is given by (Rpl/Rstar)^2.\n# So, we set amplitude = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) by taking the square root of the amplitude.\nrpl_rstar = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(rpl_rstar)\n```\n> 0.3217900517998494\n\nThe code confirms that the relative radius `Rpl/Rstar` is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem requires us to equate the dimming of a star's light caused by two different phenomena: rotational modulation due to starspots and an exoplanet transit.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the brightness drop due to starspots.**\n\nThe flux (brightness) from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer.
