    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, cage-like alkane with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh, basic conditions.\n*   **Analysis:** A standard elimination reaction (E2) to form a double bond at the bridgehead is prevented by Bredt's rule due to the high ring strain it would create in the rigid adamantane system. The reaction must proceed through a different pathway, likely a skeletal rearrangement.\n*   **Spectral Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H) are highly characteristic. The total integration (14H) matches the number of protons in the starting material. The unusual downfield shift to 4.79 ppm for two protons, combined with the ketone group, points to a strained ring system.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** These spectral data are a perfect match for **protoadamantan-4-one**. This product is formed via a complex base-induced rearrangement (a homo-Favorskii type reaction) of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The two protons at 4.79 ppm are the bridgehead protons of the strained cyclopropane-like portion of the protoadamantane skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide, heated.\n*   **Analysis:** Aluminum isopropoxide is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which would reduce the ketone to an alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol). However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This confirms that Product 2 must be an alkene. The reaction conditions (Lewis acid from Al(OiPr)₃ and heat) are ideal for promoting carbocation formation and rearrangement. The strained protoadamantane skeleton is thermodynamically driven to rearrange to the much more stable adamantane skeleton.\n    1.  The ketone is likely reduced to the alcohol, protoadamantan-4-ol.\n    2.  The alcohol is protonated by the Lewis acid, and water leaves, forming the protoadamant-4-yl cation.\n    3.  This cation undergoes a rapid skeletal rearrangement to the more stable adamant-2-yl cation.\n    4.  Elimination of a proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbocation forms the alkene. Elimination of a proton from the adjacent bridgehead carbon (C1) results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The most plausible structure for Product 2 is **adamantene** (specifically, tricyclo[3.3.1.1³⁷]dec-2-ene), the rearranged and more stable alkene.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (adamantene).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C; 2. Dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The C=C double bond is cleaved, and each carbon of the original double bond becomes a carbonyl group.\n    *   The double bond in adamantene is between a bridgehead carbon (a tertiary CH group in the parent alkane) and a bridge carbon (a secondary CH₂ group in the parent alkane). Let's denote them as C¹(tert) and C²(sec). In the alkene, the bond is between a quaternary C¹ and a secondary CH.\n    *   Ozonolysis cleaves the C¹=C² bond.\n    *   The quaternary carbon (C¹) becomes a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The secondary CH carbon (C²) becomes an aldehyde (CHO).\n    *   This cleavage opens one of the rings of the adamantane cage, resulting in a bicyclic skeleton. The product is a keto-aldehyde based on a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The product is a **keto-aldehyde**, specifically a **formyl-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanone** isomer (e.g., 7-formylbicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one).\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (the keto-aldehyde), the most deshielded proton will be the aldehyde proton (-CHO), which typically appears at δ 9-10 ppm. The question asks for the coupling pattern of this proton.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:**\n    1.  **³J Coupling (Vicinal):** The aldehyde proton (H-C=O) is coupled to the proton(s) on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon). In the structure of our product, the formyl group is attached to a bridgehead carbon of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. This α-carbon has only **one** proton attached to it. This coupling (³J) will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **⁴J Coupling (Long-Range):** In rigid cyclic systems like this, long-range coupling over four bonds is often observed, particularly when the bonds form a \"W\" or \"M\" shape. The aldehyde proton can couple with protons on the β-carbons. In the stable chair-chair conformation of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring, the aldehyde proton can be in a W-arrangement with two axial protons on the adjacent methylene groups. Due to the symmetry of the skeleton, these two β-protons are magnetically equivalent. Coupling to these **two** equivalent protons will split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n*   **Final Pattern:** The signal for the aldehyde proton is first split into a doublet by the single α-proton, and each peak of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the two equivalent β-protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA) doublet of triplets\nB) pentet\nC) triplet\nD) triplet of triplets\n\nThe derived pattern matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
