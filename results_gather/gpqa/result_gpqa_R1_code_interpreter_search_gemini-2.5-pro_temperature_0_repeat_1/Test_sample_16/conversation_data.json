    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves the equilibrium between the Ca-EDTA complex and its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The formation of the complex is represented by the following reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Define the Formation Constant ($K_f$):** The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction, also known as the stability constant, is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The expression for $K_f$ is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **Consider the Dissociation:** Since we start with the complex, it's easier to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We are given that the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n    From the table, at equilibrium:\n    *   $[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$\n    *   $[Ca^{2+}] = x$\n    *   $[EDTA^{4-}] = x$\n\n5.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Make a Simplifying Assumption:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This means the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex), and the amount of dissociation (x) will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can assume that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n7.  **Solve for x:** The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n8.  **Final Concentration:** The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** This calculated value matches option D.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a simple Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the equation: K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# Approximating initial_complex_conc - x as initial_complex_conc\n# K_f = initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n# x = sqrt(initial_complex_conc / K_f)\n\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **The Chemical Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction to consider is its dissociation:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the complex, which corresponds to the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$):\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Setting up the ICE Table:** We can track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Applying the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Equation:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is a very large number. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solving for x:** Now, we solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option D. The calculation was confirmed by the Python script output of `6.32e-07`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
