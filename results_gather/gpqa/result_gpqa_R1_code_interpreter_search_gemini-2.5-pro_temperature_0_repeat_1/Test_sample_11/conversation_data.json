    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics Principles\n\nThe decay of a particle at rest into two other particles is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy of the system after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum of the system after the decay.\n\n### 2. Define the System and Given Values\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n*   **Initial State:** The positive pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n    *   Initial momentum, `p_pi` = 0.\n    *   Initial kinetic energy, `KE_pi` = 0.\n    *   Initial total energy, `E_pi` = Rest mass energy of Pi(+) = `m_pi * c^2`.\n*   **Final State:** The products are a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Final momentum = `p_mu` + `p_nu` (vector sum).\n    *   Final total energy = `E_mu` + `E_nu`.\n*   **Given Rest Masses (in energy units):**\n    *   Rest mass energy of Pi(+), `M_pi` = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Rest mass energy of mu(+), `M_mu` = 105.7 MeV.\n*   **Assumption:** The neutrino (nu) is considered massless, which is a standard approximation in this type of problem.\n    *   Rest mass energy of nu, `M_nu` = 0 MeV.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial pion is at rest (`p_pi` = 0), the total momentum after the decay must also be zero.\n`p_mu` + `p_nu` = 0\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n|`p_mu`| = |`p_nu`| = `p`\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before equals the total energy after:\n`E_pi` = `E_mu` + `E_nu`\n\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`:\n*   `E_pi` = `M_pi` = 139.6 MeV (since it's at rest)\n*   `E_mu` = `KE_mu` + `M_mu`\n*   `E_nu` = `KE_nu` + `M_nu` = `KE_nu` (since `M_nu` = 0)\n\nSo, the energy conservation equation is:\n`M_pi` = (`KE_mu` + `M_mu`) + `KE_nu`\n139.6 MeV = `KE_mu` + 105.7 MeV + `KE_nu`\n`KE_mu` + `KE_nu` = 139.6 - 105.7\n`KE_mu` + `KE_nu` = 33.9 MeV  ---(Equation 1)\n\nThis tells us that the total kinetic energy of the products is the difference in rest mass energy between the initial and final particles, also known as the Q-value of the decay.\n\n### 5. Relate Energy and Momentum to Solve for Individual KEs\n\nWe need another equation to solve for the two unknowns (`KE_mu` and `KE_nu`). We use the momentum relation `p_mu = p_nu`.\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation:\n*   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p_mu * c)^2 + M_mu^2` => `(p * c)^2 = E_mu^2 - M_mu^2`\n*   For the (massless) neutrino: `E_nu^2 = (p_nu * c)^2 + M_nu^2` => `E_nu^2 = (p * c)^2`\n\nEquating the expressions for `(p * c)^2`:\n`E_mu^2 - M_mu^2 = E_nu^2`\n\nNow substitute `E_mu = KE_mu + M_mu` and `E_nu = KE_nu`:\n` (KE_mu + M_mu)^2 - M_mu^2 = KE_nu^2 `\n` KE_mu^2 + 2 * KE_mu * M_mu + M_mu^2 - M_mu^2 = KE_nu^2 `\n` KE_mu^2 + 2 * KE_mu * M_mu = KE_nu^2 ` ---(Equation 2)\n\n### 6. Solve the System of Equations\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `KE_nu = 33.9 - KE_mu`\n2.  `KE_mu^2 + 2 * KE_mu * M_mu = KE_nu^2`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`KE_mu^2 + 2 * KE_mu * (105.7) = (33.9 - KE_mu)^2`\n`KE_mu^2 + 211.4 * KE_mu = 33.9^2 - 2 * 33.9 * KE_mu + KE_mu^2`\n`KE_mu^2 + 211.4 * KE_mu = 1149.21 - 67.8 * KE_mu + KE_mu^2`\n\nCancel `KE_mu^2` from both sides:\n`211.4 * KE_mu = 1149.21 - 67.8 * KE_mu`\n\nNow, solve for `KE_mu`:\n`211.4 * KE_mu + 67.8 * KE_mu = 1149.21`\n`279.2 * KE_mu = 1149.21`\n`KE_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2`\n`KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nNow find `KE_nu` using Equation 1:\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.116`\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\n### 7. Final Answer\n\nRounding the results to two decimal places, we get:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (`KE_mu`) = 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (`KE_nu`) = 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a general formula for the energy of a decay product. For a decay `1 -> 2 + 3`, the energy of particle 2 is given by:\n`E_2 = (M_1^2 + M_2^2 - M_3^2) / (2 * M_1)`\n\nLet's calculate the energy of the muon (`E_mu`):\n`E_mu = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2 - 0^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`E_mu = (19488.16 + 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.816 MeV`\n`KE_mu = E_mu - M_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV`\n\nAnd the energy of the neutrino (`E_nu`):\n`E_nu = (139.6^2 + 0^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`E_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.784 MeV`\nSince the neutrino is massless, `KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
