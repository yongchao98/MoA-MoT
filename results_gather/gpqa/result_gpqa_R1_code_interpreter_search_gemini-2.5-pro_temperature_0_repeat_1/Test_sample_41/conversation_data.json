    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    In this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem also states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is only dependent on the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{a} \\right)^{1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the semi-major axes.**\n    From the relationship above, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (i and j) is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\left( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\right)^{-1/2} = \\left( \\frac{a_j}{a_i} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Using the formula for the ratio of Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = 1.4$\n    Squaring both sides gives the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 1.4^2 = 1.96$\n\n    Similarly, for Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2} = 2.3$\n    Squaring both sides:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = 2.3^2 = 5.29$\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axis of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($a_3/a_1$).**\n    We can find this by multiplying the two ratios we just calculated:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to relate the orbital periods and semi-major axes.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($P$) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be written as a ratio:\n    $\\left( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^3$\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n    The information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is extra information not needed for this calculation, as the planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final ratio of the orbital periods ($P_3/P_1$).**\n    Substitute the value of $a_3/a_1$ into the equation from Kepler's Third Law.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script for the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nT_ratio_12 = 1.4\nT_ratio_23 = 2.3\n\n# From T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2), we get a_j/a_i = (T_eq_i/T_eq_j)^2\na_ratio_21 = T_ratio_12**2\na_ratio_32 = T_ratio_23**2\n\n# Calculate the overall semi-major axis ratio a3/a1\na_ratio_31 = a_ratio_32 * a_ratio_21\n\n# From Kepler's Third Law, P ∝ a^(3/2)\n# So, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP_ratio_31 = a_ratio_31**(3/2)\n\nprint(P_ratio_31)\n```\n<execute_code>\n33.38624800333432\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.39. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
