    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The formula for the ring itself is C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms. So the formula must contain O2.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) from structure:** A benzene ring has a DoU of 4. An ester group has a C=O double bond, which adds 1 to the DoU. The 1H NMR indicates vinyl protons, meaning there is at least one C=C double bond, which adds another 1 to the DoU. Therefore, the minimum expected DoU is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring, a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern often leads to two signals for the four aromatic protons due to symmetry. Other substitution patterns (1,2-ortho or 1,3-meta) would typically produce four distinct signals. So, we can assume a para-substituted benzene ring (p-C6H4).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons and one of the methyl groups. The formula for this substituent is -C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We've identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). Its signal would be a doublet because it's coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton. There must be a second -CH3 group in the molecule, which would account for the second -CH3 signal.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   The other substituent must be the ester group and contain the second methyl group. To satisfy the \"no -CH2-\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3). An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) is ruled out because it contains a -CH2- group. The methyl group of the ester would appear as a singlet in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   So, the two substituents are -CH=CH-CH3 and -COOCH3. The most likely structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n4.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Let's sum the atoms from the deduced structure:\n        *   Benzene ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n        *   Methyl ester group: COOCH3 (which is C2H3O2)\n    *   Total Carbon (C) = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11\n    *   Total Hydrogen (H) = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Total Oxygen (O) = 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the proposed formula C11H12O2:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   This matches the expected DoU of 6 calculated from the structural features (ring + C=O + C=C).\n\n6.  **Check Other Options:**\n    *   A) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. Inconsistent.\n    *   C) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. Inconsistent (missing a double bond).\n    *   D) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. While the DoU matches, it's not possible to construct a molecule with this formula that fits all the specific NMR constraints (especially the number of vinyl/methyl signals and the absence of CH2 groups), as detailed in the thought process.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only formula that corresponds to a valid chemical structure is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
