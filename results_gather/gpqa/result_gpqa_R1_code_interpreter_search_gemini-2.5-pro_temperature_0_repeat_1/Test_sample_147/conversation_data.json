    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine can be expressed as:\nɷF = (n × M_F) / (M_Y + n × M_F)\nwhere M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~18.998 g/mol) and M_Y is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M_Y:\n0.3196 = (n × 18.998) / (M_Y + n × 18.998)\n0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * (n × 18.998) = n × 18.998\n0.3196 * M_Y = n × 18.998 × (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M_Y = n × 18.998 × 0.6804\nM_Y = n × (18.998 × 0.6804 / 0.3196)\nM_Y ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe need to find an integer 'n' that corresponds to a known element Y which forms multiple fluorides.\n*   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar, K - unlikely candidates).\n*   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, but bromine fluorides' %F do not match).\n*   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n = 4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy).\n*   If n = 5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg, Bi).\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for SbF3 (n=3):\nM(SbF3) = 121.760 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\nɷF(SbF3) = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.31884 or 31.884%.\nThis value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with the small difference likely attributable to rounding in the problem statement. Thus, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Compounds**\n\n*   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine (F2). This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common higher fluoride is SbF5. The reaction would be SbF5 → SbF3 + F2. A1 also oxidizes xenon. SbF5 is a very strong oxidizing agent and is known to react with xenon (Xe + 2SbF5 → [XeF]+[Sb2F11]−). This fits. (Note: The problem describes A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\", while SbF5 is a colorless, stable liquid. This is a known inconsistency in this classic puzzle problem, but the chemical reactivity points strongly to SbF5).\n\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and also interacts with xenon. Fluorination of antimony can yield SbF3 or SbF5. Since it interacts with xenon, it must be the powerful oxidizing agent **SbF5**.\n\n*   **A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A4 must be a binary fluoride of antimony, so it is either SbF3 or SbF5.\n    *   Case 1: A4 = SbF5. The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. This is a comproportionation reaction. The standard reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3, which is not 1:1.\n    *   Case 2: A4 = SbF3. The reaction is Sb + SbF3 → A5. This would involve the reduction of Sb(III), which is less common than comproportionation but plausible in the context of a puzzle that may involve unusual species (like a subfluoride, SbF, as A5).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nWe have two candidates for A4: SbF3 and SbF5. Let's calculate their molecular weights and check against the given options.\n\n*   **Molecular Weight of SbF3**:\n    MW = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Molecular Weight of SbF5**:\n    MW = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\nA) 220-240\nB) 160-180\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within the range **B) 160-180**.\nThe calculated molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any of the provided ranges.\n\nTherefore, based on the options, A4 must be SbF3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
