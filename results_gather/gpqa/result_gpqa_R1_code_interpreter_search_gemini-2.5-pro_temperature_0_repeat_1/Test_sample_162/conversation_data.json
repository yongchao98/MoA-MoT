    "This is a multi-step chemistry problem involving stoichiometry, solubility equilibrium, and pH calculations. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n**1. Stoichiometry of the Dissolution Reaction**\n\nFirst, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, a sparingly soluble base, in a strong acid (represented by H+).\n\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that for every 1 mole of solid Fe(OH)3 that dissolves, 3 moles of H+ ions are consumed.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nWe are given 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3. We need to convert this mass to moles using its molar mass.\n*   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3:\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**3. Determine the pH of the Final Solution using Solubility Product (Ksp)**\n\nFor the Fe(OH)3 to be completely dissolved, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. The minimum amount of acid is required when the solution is exactly saturated.\n\nThe dissolution equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nThe concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution will be:\n[Fe³⁺] = moles / volume = (9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.3575 x 10⁻³ M\n\nThe Ksp for Fe(OH)3 at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹. We can now calculate the maximum hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] allowed in the solution for it to be saturated.\n\n[OH⁻]³ = Ksp / [Fe³⁺] = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.3575 x 10⁻³) = 2.9818 x 10⁻³⁷\n[OH⁻] = (2.9818 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) = 6.680 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nNow, we can find the pOH and then the pH of the resulting solution:\npOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.680 x 10⁻¹³) = 12.175\npH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.175 = 1.825\n\nLooking at the options, pH = 2.04 is the closest value. The discrepancy arises from using slightly different Ksp values found in various sources. Let's proceed by checking if pH = 2.04 is consistent.\n\nIf pH = 2.04, then [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M.\npOH = 14 - 2.04 = 11.96\n[OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶ M\nIon Product = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.3575 x 10⁻³)(10⁻¹¹.⁹⁶)³ = 2.08 x 10⁻³⁹. This is very close to the literature Ksp value, confirming that pH ≈ 2.04 is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the Volume of Acid Needed**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid is used for two purposes:\n1.  **To react with Fe(OH)3:** From stoichiometry, this is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.\n2.  **To establish the final acidic pH:** This is the amount of H⁺ remaining in the solution.\n\nLet V_acid be the required volume of the 0.1 M acid in cm³.\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺ added** = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × (V_acid / 1000) L\n*   **Moles of H⁺ reacted** = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 × 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ = 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   **Moles of H⁺ remaining** = [H⁺]_final × V_total = (10⁻².⁰⁴ M) × 0.1 L = 9.120 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nNow, set up the balance equation:\nTotal H⁺ added = H⁺ reacted + H⁺ remaining\n0.1 × (V_acid / 1000) = 2.8073 x 10⁻³ + 9.120 x 10⁻⁴\n0.0001 × V_acid = 3.7193 x 10⁻³\nV_acid = (3.7193 x 10⁻³) / 0.0001\nV_acid = 37.193 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) is significantly different from the value in option D (28.05 cm³). Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nA common simplification in such problems is to assume that the volume of the acid added is negligible compared to the final volume, or that the final volume is made up *to* 100 cm³ with water *after* adding the acid. However, the most accurate interpretation is that the total moles of H+ are present in the final 100 cm³ volume.\n\nLet's re-calculate using the exact values from the provided options to see which one is self-consistent.\n\n**Test Option D: pH = 2.04; V_acid = 28.05 cm³**\n\n*   If V_acid = 28.05 cm³, total moles of H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 × moles Fe(OH)3 = 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol.\n*   Moles of H⁺ remaining = Total H⁺ added - H⁺ reacted = (2.805 x 10⁻³) - (2.8073 x 10⁻³) ≈ -2.3 x 10⁻⁶ mol.\n\nThis result is impossible (negative remaining moles). This indicates there is a flaw in the problem statement or the provided options.\n\nLet's reconsider the stoichiometry. The amount of H+ needed just to neutralize the base is 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol. The volume of 0.1 M acid to provide this is:\nV = moles / Molarity = (2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 M = 0.028073 L = 28.073 cm³.\n\nThis volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option D. It seems the problem intended to ask for the volume of acid required for neutralization, and then separately calculate the pH, possibly assuming the excess H+ is negligible or that the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the resulting Fe³⁺ ion.\n\nLet's follow this line of reasoning:\n1.  **Volume of Acid for Neutralization:**\n    V_acid ≈ 28.05 cm³. This amount of acid almost perfectly neutralizes the Fe(OH)3.\n2.  **pH of the Resulting Solution:**\n    After neutralization, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions at a concentration of 9.3575 x 10⁻³ M. The Fe³⁺ ion is the conjugate acid of a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic:\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n    The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe³⁺(aq) is related to the base dissociation constant (Kb) of Fe(OH)₂⁺, which is complex. A more direct approach is using the Ksp and Kw:\n    Ka = Kw / Kb. The Ka for the hydrated iron ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ is typically given as ~6.3 x 10⁻³.\n\n    Using this Ka value:\n    Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n    6.3 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (9.3575 x 10⁻³ - x)\n    Assuming x is small: x² ≈ (6.3 x 10⁻³)(9.3575 x 10⁻³) = 5.895 x 10⁻⁵\n    x = [H⁺] ≈ 7.68 x 10⁻³ M\n    pH = -log₁₀(7.68 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.11\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.11 is very close to the pH of 2.04 given in option D. The small difference can be attributed to using a slightly different Ka value or the fact that a tiny excess of strong acid is indeed present.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logic that best fits the provided options is:\n1.  The volume of acid (28.05 cm³) is primarily that which is required for the stoichiometric neutralization of the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3.\n2.  The final pH of the solution (pH 2.04) is determined by the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ions produced, which makes the solution acidic.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most plausible answer, despite the slight inconsistencies when performing a rigorous calculation that accounts for all factors simultaneously.\n\n<<<D>>>"
