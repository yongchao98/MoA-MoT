    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states, `i` and `j`. Let's consider the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_excited`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_ground`). The equation is:\n    \n    N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    \n    Where:\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    *   `g_excited` and `g_ground` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the respective energy levels.\n\n3.  **Apply to Both Stars:** We can write this equation for each star. Let `T_1` and `T_2` be the temperatures of star_1 and star_2, respectively. The term `(g_excited / g_ground)` is a constant for the specific iron transition, so it will be the same for both stars. Let's call this constant `C`.\n\n    For star_1:\n    (N_excited / N_ground)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    \n    For star_2:\n    (N_excited / N_ground)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms in star_1 is twice the same ratio in star_2.\n    \n    (N_excited / N_ground)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n    \n    C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperatures:** We can simplify this equation:\n    \n    *   Cancel the constant `C` from both sides:\n        exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    \n    *   Isolate the '2' by dividing both sides by `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`:\n        exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n    \n    *   Use the exponent rule `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n        exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ) = 2\n        exp( ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) ) = 2\n    \n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        ln(exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )) = ln(2)\n        (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    \n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n        (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Substitute the Numerical Values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental physical constant with a value of approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    \n    Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K\n    \n    The problem is designed so that this pre-factor `(ΔE / k)` simplifies to 1.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived equation:\n    \n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    \n    Which simplifies to:\n    \n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
