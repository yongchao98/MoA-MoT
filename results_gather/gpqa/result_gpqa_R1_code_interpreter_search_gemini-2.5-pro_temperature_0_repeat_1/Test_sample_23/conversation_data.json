    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n*   `0.1428 * (12n + m) = m`\n*   `1.7136n + 0.1428m = m`\n*   `1.7136n = 0.8572m`\n*   `m/n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`\n*   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2. The H/C ratio is > 2.\n*   The general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n. The H/C ratio is exactly 2.\n*   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. This perfectly matches the mass percentage: `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. Let the other component of Y be D.\n*   Hydrogenation of Z (CnH2n) gives no reaction.\n*   Hydrogenation of D must give Z (CnH2n).\n*   Since D is part of mixture Y, it does not decolorize bromine water. An aromatic compound fits this description, as it only undergoes hydrogenation under severe conditions and does not react with bromine water.\n*   For D to hydrogenate to CnH2n, it must have the same carbon skeleton. The corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon would have the formula CnH2n-6 (the benzene series).\n*   So, Mixture Y consists of an aromatic hydrocarbon (CnH2n-6) and a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   Let's consider the simplest and most common case, where n=6.\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is a widely used solvent.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound is Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   So, Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}. This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of this mixture (specifically, the benzene component) yields pure cyclohexane (Z). This hypothesis fits all the conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   X has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction carried out by heating with platinum.\n    *   `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)`\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One molecule is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   The total number of atoms must be conserved.\n    *   Reactants: A + B\n    *   Products: C6H6 + C6H12. Total atoms in products: 12 Carbon, 18 Hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, the combined formula of A and B is C12H18.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B must have a C6 ring carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's deduce the formulas of A and B. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) must be more unsaturated than benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) must be less saturated than cyclohexane.\n    *   The hydrogen donor (let's say A) reacts to form benzene: `A → C6H6 + H2` (conceptually). This means A must be C6H8.\n    *   The hydrogen acceptor (let's say B) reacts to form cyclohexane: `B + H2 → C6H12`. This means B must be C6H10.\n*   So, mixture X consists of C6H8 and C6H10.\n*   Let's check the constraints for these components.\n    *   A = C6H8: This is a cyclohexadiene. To have no conjugated bonds, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated).\n    *   B = C6H10: This is **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n*   Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene are liquids at room temperature and will decolorize bromine water. The proposed mixture X = {1,4-cyclohexadiene, cyclohexene} fits all the conditions of the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1 is cyclohexene (C6H10). It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2 is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n(Note: While a similar scenario could be constructed for n=7 (Y = {Toluene, Methylcyclohexane}, X = {C7H10, C7H12}, total H = 22), the C6 system is the most fundamental and archetypal example of this chemical transformation, making it the most probable intended answer in a problem of this type.)\n\n<<<D>>>"
