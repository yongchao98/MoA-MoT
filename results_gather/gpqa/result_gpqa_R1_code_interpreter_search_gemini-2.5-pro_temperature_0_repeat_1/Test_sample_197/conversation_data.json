    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M.\n    *   Thiocyanate ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M.\n    *   Overall stability constants for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:\n        *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺` ; `β₁ = [Co(SCN)]⁺ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` ; `β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻` ; `β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n        *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` ; `β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n    We can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants `β_n`:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n    Substituting these into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Define the Fraction of the Desired Species:**\n    The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α₂`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions from step 3:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Justify the Assumption for Ligand Concentration:**\n    The total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is significantly smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the thiocyanate is in large excess, and the amount consumed to form complexes is small compared to its total concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand `[SCN⁻]` as its initial total concentration, `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Value:**\n    Let's calculate the denominator of the fraction, which we'll call `D`:\n    `D = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n    `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n    `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `D = 2.3646`\n\n    Now, calculate the numerator term for `α₂`:\n    `Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    To get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n    Percentage = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches option D. To ensure accuracy, we can use a python script for the calculation.\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The denominator of the fraction formula (alpha) is the sum of all terms in the distribution equation\n# D = 1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc + beta2 * (scn_conc**2) + beta3 * (scn_conc**3) + beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# The numerator for the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2] is the term corresponding to this species\nnumerator_co_scn2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# The fraction (alpha2) of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its term to the sum of all terms\nalpha2 = numerator_co_scn2 / denominator\n\n# The percentage is the fraction multiplied by 100\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free (uncomplexed) `Co²⁺` ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\n\nThe overall stability constants (`β_n`) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**3. Formulate the Fraction (α)**\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, in this case `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is denoted by `α₂`. It is the ratio of the concentration of that complex to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Make a Reasonable Assumption**\n\nThe total concentration of the ligand `[SCN⁻]` (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal `c(Co)` (0.01 M). This means the ligand is in large excess, and the concentration of the free ligand at equilibrium will be very close to its initial total concentration. Therefore, we can approximate `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Result**\n\nNow, we plug the given values into the formula for `α₂`:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\nDenominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\nDenominator = `2.3646`\n\nNext, calculate the numerator:\nNumerator = `β₂ * [SCN⁻]²`\nNumerator = `40 * (0.1)²`\nNumerator = `40 * 0.01`\nNumerator = `0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the value calculated by the code (`16.916...%`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
