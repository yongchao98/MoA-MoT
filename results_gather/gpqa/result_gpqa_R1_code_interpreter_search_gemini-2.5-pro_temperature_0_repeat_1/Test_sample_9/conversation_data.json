It is, for all intents and purposes, a replica of Earth.\n    *   Earth's average density is a standard value, approximately **5.51 g/cm³**. This serves as our reference point.\n\n2.  **Analyze Planet (b)**\n    *   This planet has 2 Earth masses, and its density is explicitly stated as **approximately 5.5 g/cm³**.\n    *   This density is virtually identical to Earth's.\n\n3.  **Analyze Planet (d): The \"Sub-Earth\"**\n    *   This planet has the same composition as Earth but only half the mass.\n    *   Gravity is a function of mass. With less mass, this planet will have weaker gravity than Earth.\n    *   The force of gravity is what compresses a planet's material. With weaker gravity, the material (which is the same as Earth's) will be less compressed.\n    *   Less compression means the material takes up more volume for its mass, resulting in a **lower average density** than Earth's. So, its density will be < 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Analyze Planet (c): The \"Super-Earth\"**\n    *   This planet has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive.\n    *   With significantly more mass, this planet will have much stronger internal gravity.\n    *   This powerful gravity will squeeze and compress its constituent materials (rock and iron, just like Earth) much more tightly.\n    *   Greater compression means the same amount of material is packed into a smaller volume, resulting in a **higher average density** than Earth's. So, its density will be > 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density significantly **greater** than 5.51 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n*   Planet (d) has a density **lower** than 5.51 g/cm³ due to less gravitational compression.\n\nBy comparing the four options, the planet with 5 times the mass of Earth (c) will be the most compressed and therefore have the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>",
