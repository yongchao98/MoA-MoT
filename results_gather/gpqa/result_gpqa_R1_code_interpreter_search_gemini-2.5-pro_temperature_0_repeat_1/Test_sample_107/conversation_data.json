    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate and compare the magnitudes of two distinct energies: the paramagnetic coupling energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ and the atomic transition energy $\\Delta E$.\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Calculation\n\n**a) Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H_p = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field. The orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction energy is then:\n$H_p = \\frac{e}{2m_e} (\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}) = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$\n\nThis can be expressed using the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$:\n$H_p = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} L_z$\n\nThe expectation value of this energy for an atomic state with orbital magnetic quantum number $m$ is found by taking the eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator, which is $m\\hbar$.\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle H_p \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) = m \\mu_B B$\n\nNow, we calculate its value using the given parameters:\n*   $B = 1$ T\n*   $m$ is a small integer, so we take $m=1$ for the order of magnitude.\n*   The Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}$ J/T.\n\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (1) \\cdot (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\cdot (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n**b) Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The energy of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   Planck's constant, $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n*   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n**c) Comparison**\n\nNow we compare the two energies:\n*   $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24}$ J\n*   $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19}$ J\n\nTo compare their orders of magnitude, we can look at their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is extremely small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of the electronic transition.\n\n### 2. Conclusion\n\nThe calculation clearly shows that the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis result is expected, as the Zeeman effect (the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field) is a fine structure effect, representing a very small perturbation to the main energy levels of an atom. The transition energy given corresponds to the visible part of the spectrum (the blue-green H-beta line of the Balmer series), which involves changes in the principal quantum number and energies on the order of electron-volts, whereas the Zeeman splitting for a 1T field is on the order of micro-electron-volts.\n\n<<<A>>>"
