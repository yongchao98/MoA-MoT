    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Metric and the Geometry**\n    The given metric is:\n    $ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\n    This is a Riemannian metric defined on a 2-dimensional space with coordinates $(x, y)$. The metric is only physically meaningful where the term in the denominator is positive, as distances must be real.\n    $4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \\implies x^2 + y^2 < 4$\n    This inequality defines the domain of our space: it is an open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin in the Euclidean $(x,y)$ plane. The problem statement \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" confirms that we should consider this disk of radius 2 as our manifold.\n\n2.  **Determine the Area Element**\n    The area element $dA$ for a metric $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$ is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor matrix.\n    In our case, the metric is diagonal (conformal to the Euclidean metric):\n    $g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    $g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    $g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\n    The determinant of the metric tensor $g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$ is:\n    $\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    The square root of the determinant is:\n    $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\left| \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\right|$\n    Since we are in the domain $x^2+y^2 < 4$, the denominator is positive, so:\n    $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n\n    Therefore, the area element is:\n    $dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n3.  **Set up the Area Integral**\n    The total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the entire domain, which is the disk $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n    $A = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n4.  **Convert to Polar Coordinates**\n    To evaluate this integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let:\n    $x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n    $y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\n    Then $x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$. The differential area element in Cartesian coordinates $dx \\, dy$ is replaced by $\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$ in polar coordinates.\n\n    The domain of integration $x^2+y^2 < 4$ becomes $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$.\n\n    The integral transforms to:\n    $A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\, \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral**\n    We can separate the integrals over $\\theta$ and $\\rho$:\n    $A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho \\right)$\n\n    The integral over $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n    $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\n    The integral over $\\rho$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ becomes infinite as $\\rho$ approaches 2. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n    $I_\\rho = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n\n    To solve this integral, we use the substitution $u = 4-\\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which means $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\n    The limits of integration for $u$ are:\n    -   When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n    -   When $\\rho = a$, $u = 4 - a^2$.\n\n    Substituting into the integral:\n    $I_\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{4}^{4-a^2} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{4}^{4-a^2} -\\frac{16}{u} \\, du$\n    $I_\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left[ -16 \\ln|u| \\right]_{4}^{4-a^2}$\n    $I_\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln|4-a^2| - (-16 \\ln|4|) \\right)$\n    Since $a < 2$, $4-a^2 > 0$, so we can drop the absolute value signs.\n    $I_\\rho = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-a^2) + 16 \\ln(4) \\right)$\n\n    Now, we evaluate the limit:\n    As $a \\to 2^-$, the term $4-a^2$ approaches $0^+$.\n    The natural logarithm $\\ln(z)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $z \\to 0^+$.\n    So, $\\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\ln(4-a^2) = -\\infty$.\n    Therefore, $\\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-a^2) \\right) = (-16) \\times (-\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n\n    The integral over $\\rho$ diverges to infinity:\n    $I_\\rho = +\\infty$\n\n6.  **Final Result**\n    The total area is the product of the two integrals:\n    $A = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n    The area of the specified pseudosphere is infinite. This is a common feature in models of hyperbolic geometry, where the boundary of the disk represents points at an infinite distance.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$ (This is a function, not a value for the area)\nB) $+\\infty$\nC) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$ (This is a function, not a value for the area)\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is $+\\infty$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
