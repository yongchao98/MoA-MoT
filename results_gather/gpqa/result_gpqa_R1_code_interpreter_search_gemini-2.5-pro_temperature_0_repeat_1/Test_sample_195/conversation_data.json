    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system, the total energy remains constant. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential, the total energy is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\text{constant}$\n    The relativistic energy of the particle is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    So, the conservation of energy equation is:\n    $\\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n    At the maximum displacement, $x = A$, the mass momentarily comes to a stop.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   Potential energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at the equilibrium position.**\n    At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Potential energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy at both points.**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Next, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    This matches option B.\n\n    *   Option A is incorrect due to signs.\n    *   Option C, $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, is the non-relativistic (classical) limit, obtained by equating classical kinetic energy $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ to potential energy $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   Option D is dimensionally inconsistent because it subtracts a term with units of velocity-squared ($\\frac{kA^2}{2m}$) from the dimensionless number 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
