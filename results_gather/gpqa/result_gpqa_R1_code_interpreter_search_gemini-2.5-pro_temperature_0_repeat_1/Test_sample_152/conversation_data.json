    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The `p-tolyl` group is a toluene ring attached at the para position. The electrophilic center for Michael addition is the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and subsequently, the C=O π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Draw and Name the Product (A):**\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the esters). This can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate.\n    *   The propane chain is C1-C2-C3. Let's number it to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The structure is `MeOOC-CH₂ - CH(p-tolyl) - CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   We can name this as a propane derivative. The main chain is C3-C2-C1.\n        *   At C1, there are two methoxycarbonyl groups: `-CH(COOMe)₂`.\n        *   At C2, there is a p-tolyl group.\n        *   At C3, there is one methoxycarbonyl group (as part of a `-CH₂COOMe` group).\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis, which is a variation of the Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are neutral nitrogen analogs of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Workup:** The reaction is followed by acidic workup (H₃O⁺), which hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion, regenerating the carbonyl group of the cyclohexanone.\n\n3.  **Draw and Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n    *   The fragment added from but-2-enenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with the `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   To name this product, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `CN-C2H₂-C3H-C4H₃`.\n    *   The substituent is on C3 and is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   Therefore, the name of product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns and Unknowns:**\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Unknown:** Reactant C, the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Structure of Reactant C from the Product:**\n    *   The product is formed by a Michael addition. The added fragment is `-(3-oxobutyl)`, which has the structure `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   This fragment results from the attack of a nucleophile onto the β-carbon of MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) followed by protonation.\n    *   The product shows that this `(3-oxobutyl)` group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, formed at the C2 position. The protons at C2 are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates C2 of the Michael donor to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, the reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = correct, B = correct, C = incorrect (2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione is a different molecule).\n*   B) A = correct, B = correct, C = correct.\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect, C = correct.\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = incorrect, C = incorrect.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies all reactants and products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
