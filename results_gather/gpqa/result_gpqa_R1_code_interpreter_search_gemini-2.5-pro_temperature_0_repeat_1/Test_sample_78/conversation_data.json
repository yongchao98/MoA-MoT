    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product's NMR spectra to determine its structure.**\n\nThe reaction is described as Compound X (C11H12O) reacting with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) at high temperature, resulting in a product whose NMR spectra are provided. This is likely an isomerization reaction, meaning the product also has the molecular formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   Signals at **δ 21.3** and **δ 28.4** are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two methyl groups.\n    *   The remaining signals are in the sp2 region (δ 126-145), corresponding to aromatic and alkene carbons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The absence of a signal around δ 9-10 ppm, combined with the carbonyl signal in the 13C NMR, indicates the product is a **ketone**, not an aldehyde.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons. This is consistent with one methyl group being attached to an aromatic ring (like in a tolyl group) and the other being part of an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, are characteristic of two protons on a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-) that are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product's Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (a ketone, two methyl groups, a para-substituted benzene ring, and a -CH=CH- double bond), we can propose a structure. The most plausible structure that incorporates all these features is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Let's verify this structure against the data:\n    *   **Structure:** `CH3(a)-C6H4-CH(b)=CH(c)-C(=O)-CH3(d)`\n    *   **Formula:** C11H12O. This matches.\n    *   **1H NMR signals:**\n        *   `CH3(a)` (tolyl methyl): One singlet (δ 2.31).\n        *   `CH3(d)` (acetyl methyl): One singlet (δ 2.28).\n        *   `p-C6H4-`: Two 2H doublets (δ 7.08 and 7.71).\n        *   `-CH(b)=CH(c)-`: Two 1H doublets (δ 7.68 and 6.75). The proton β to the carbonyl (H(b)) is more deshielded than the proton α to the carbonyl (H(c)).\n    *   The proposed structure is fully consistent with the provided 1H and 13C NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound X from the given options.**\n\nThe reaction is the isomerization of Compound X into 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The starting material must therefore have the same atoms arranged differently. Specifically, it must contain a **p-tolyl group**.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** The term \"styryl\" implies a `phenyl-CH=CH-` group. This contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Also, the formula is C10H10O, which is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This also contains a styryl (phenyl) group, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot be the precursor.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-tolyl-CH=CH-`. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This compound has the correct formula (C11H12O) and the necessary p-tolyl group.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n\nOnly option C has the correct carbon skeleton to form the identified product.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the reaction pathway.**\n\nCompound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, which is a vinylic epoxide. The reaction with a base like DABCO at high temperature is a known base-catalyzed isomerization of a vinylic epoxide. The mechanism involves deprotonation of the proton on the oxirane carbon that is also allylic to the double bond. This generates an anion that rearranges to an enolate, which then tautomerizes to the final, more stable, conjugated ketone product.\n\n`p-tolyl-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2` (Compound X from option C)  ---(DABCO, 403 K)---> `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3` (Product)\n\nThis transformation is chemically sound and connects the starting material from option C to the product determined from the NMR spectra.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
