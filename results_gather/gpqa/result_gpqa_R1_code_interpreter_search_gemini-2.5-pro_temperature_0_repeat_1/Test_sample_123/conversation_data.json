    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` remaining at time `t` from an initial number `N_0` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N_0 * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame where time `t` is measured.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Their internal \"clock\" runs slower compared to the clock in the laboratory frame (the detector's frame). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to their proper mean lifetime (`τ_0`, the lifetime in their own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ_0`\n    The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `v` is the particle's velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius `L = 30 m`. They travel this distance to reach the inner walls. The time this takes in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = L / v`\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\" (`γ ~ 20`), their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. We can make the excellent approximation `v ≈ c`.\n    So, `t_lab ≈ L / c`.\n\n4.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is the fraction that has not decayed after the time `t_lab`.\n    Fraction `f = N(t_lab) / N_0 = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n    `f = exp(-(L / c) / (γ * τ_0))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `f = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ_0))`\n\n5.  **Setting up the Equations:** We have two scenarios. Let's analyze them using the formula derived above. The term `L / (c * τ_0)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction reaching the wall, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n        *   Fraction reaching the wall, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n6.  **Solving for `γ₂`:** We can solve for `γ₂` by first taking the natural logarithm of both equations:\n    *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `-ln(3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:** Now we can compute the value of `γ₂`. I will use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ngamma_1 = 20\n# The relationship derived is gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n# ln(3/2) is also ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * (math.log(3) / math.log(1.5))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.1884312241228\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` is approximately 54.19.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 68\n    B) 54\n    C) 40\n    D) 28\n\nThe value `54.19` is closest to `54`.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are the exponential decay law and time dilation from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:** The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a time `t` in a given reference frame is described by the formula:\n    `f = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ_effective)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles, `N(t)` is the number at time `t`, and `τ_effective` is the mean lifetime in that frame.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The particles are moving, so their lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame (the detector's frame) is dilated. This effective lifetime `τ_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ₀` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance `L = 30 m` to the inner wall. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = exp(-(L / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    This can be written as:\n    `f = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n6.  **Set Up a System of Equations for the Two Scenarios:**\n    The term `L / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this particle and detector. Let's call this constant `A`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-A / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-A / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂` is the unknown Lorentz factor.\n        `2/3 = exp(-A / γ₂)`\n\n7.  **Solve for `γ₂`:**\n    First, take the natural logarithm of both equations to solve for `A` and then `γ₂`.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1:\n        `ln(1/3) = -A / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -A / 20`\n        `A = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   From Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = -A / γ₂`\n        `γ₂ = -A / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `A` from the first step into the second:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`, we have `ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2)`.\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the provided calculation:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value of `γ₂` is approximately 54.2. This is closest to option B.\n\n    A) 68\n    B) 54\n    C) 40\n    D) 28\n\n<<<B>>>"
