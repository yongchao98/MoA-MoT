    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This means the starting material is a single enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The ketone group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces (top or bottom).\n    *   This non-selective attack results in the formation of two possible configurations at the new chiral center (C3): (R) and (S).\n    *   Since the starting molecule already has a chiral center at C5 with (S) configuration, the two products will be:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but different spatial arrangements. They are stereoisomers. Since one chiral center is the same (S) and the other is different (R vs. S), they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to alcohols. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This product molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships between these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material was achiral, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**.\n        *   **(2S, 4R):** This is identical to the (2R, 4S) meso compound (rotating the molecule 180 degrees in the plane shows they are the same).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The final mixture contains 5 compounds in total.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Counting the peaks:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical polarities and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Compound 5 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has a different polarity and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   So, the products from Reaction II will produce **2 peaks** (one for the enantiomeric pair, one for the meso compound).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will be well-separated from each other.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It **can** separate enantiomers.\n    *   It **can also** separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** We have 5 distinct stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Counting the peaks:**\n    *   A chiral column is designed to separate all non-identical stereoisomers. Since all five compounds in the mixture are stereochemically distinct, they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Assuming the column has sufficient resolving power (which is the standard assumption in such problems), all five compounds will be separated.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
