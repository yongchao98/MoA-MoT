    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, meaning they only contain single bonds (besides the C=O in the carboxyl group). This information is consistent with all four options.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial information comes from the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the **n+1 rule**, where a proton's signal is split into `n+1` peaks by `n` equivalent neighboring protons. For complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton (let's call it Hₓ) is coupled to:\n    *   1 neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   2 equivalent neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet).\n    *   3 equivalent neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet).\n*   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton (let's call it Hᵧ) is coupled to:\n    *   1 neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   2 equivalent neighboring protons (giving one **t**riplet).\n    *   Another set of 2 equivalent neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each proposed structure to see which one matches the required splitting patterns. We will focus on the protons on the main carbon chain (methine, -CH- protons), as they are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   `HOOC-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₃`\n*   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂ on C4 (2H). This would give a **dtt**.\n*   The proton on C2 is coupled to the H on C3 (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This would give a **dt**.\n*   **Result:** This structure has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. So, A is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   `HOOC-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₂-CH₃`\n*   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₃ group (3H), and the CH₂ on C4 (2H). This would give a **dqt** (doublet of quartets of triplets).\n*   The proton on C2 is coupled to the H on C3 (1H) and the CH₃ group (3H). This would give a **dq** (doublet of quartets).\n*   **Result:** This structure has neither a `dtt` nor a `dtq`. So, B is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's draw this structure as written and label the key protons on the backbone:\n`CH₃(a) - CH(b)(C₂H₅) - CH(e)(C₂H₅) - CH₂(h) - COOH`\n\n*   **Analyze proton H(e):** This proton is on a carbon atom connected to:\n    *   The adjacent `CH(b)` group (1 proton neighbor). This coupling creates a **doublet**.\n    *   The adjacent `CH₂(h)` group (2 proton neighbors). This coupling creates a **triplet**.\n    *   The `CH₂` of the ethyl group attached to its own carbon (2 proton neighbors). This coupling creates another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for proton H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **Analyze proton H(b):** This proton is on a carbon atom connected to:\n    *   The adjacent `CH(e)` group (1 proton neighbor). This coupling creates a **doublet**.\n    *   The `CH₂` of the ethyl group attached to its own carbon (2 proton neighbors). This coupling creates a **triplet**.\n    *   The adjacent `CH₃(a)` group (3 proton neighbors). This coupling creates a **quartet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for proton H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n*   **Result:** This structure perfectly matches the NMR data, showing both a `dtt` and a `dtq`.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₃`\n*   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), its CH₃ group (3H), and the CH₂ on C2 (2H). This would give a **dqt**.\n*   The proton on C4 is coupled to the H on C3 (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H + 3H). This would give a **dqq** (doublet of quartets of quartets).\n*   **Result:** This structure has neither a `dtt` nor a `dtq`. So, D is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the ¹H NMR splitting patterns, only structure C, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, has protons that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n\n<<<C>>>"
