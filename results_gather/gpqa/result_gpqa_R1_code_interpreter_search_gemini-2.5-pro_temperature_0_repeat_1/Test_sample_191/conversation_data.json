    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** According to the principles of electrostatics, the presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will induce an electric field. However, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. To achieve this, charges within the conductor will redistribute. Specifically, a total charge of `-q` will be attracted to the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself on the cavity's surface in such a way that its electric field perfectly cancels the electric field of the point charge `+q` for all points within the conductor's material and outside of it. This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor as a whole was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the bulk of the conductor, a net positive charge of `+q` must be left behind. In the absence of any external electric fields, this excess charge `+q` will move to the outer surface of the conductor to be as far apart as possible, minimizing electrostatic repulsion.\n\n5.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere. Due to the shielding effect of the conductor, the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the configuration of charges inside the cavity (the point charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall). Since the outer surface is spherical and there are no other external charges, the charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the electric field outside:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges. These are:\n    *   The point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n    As established in step 3 (shielding), the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge `+q` distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The charge is distributed uniformly on a sphere centered at O (the center of the conductor).\n    *   The point P is at a distance `L` from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at O:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its position `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta`, are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
