    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is the IUPAC name for cyclohexene oxide. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons, C1 and C6. The oxygen atom is numbered C7.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The configuration of the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, C6) is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\nLet's determine the 3D structure from this information. We will use a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring with wedges (for bonds coming out of the plane, beta) and dashes (for bonds going into the plane, alpha).\n\n1.  **Epoxide Orientation:** Let's test the stereochemistry. The epoxide connects C1 and C6. Let's assume the epoxide is on the alpha face (pointing down, dashed bonds to O).\n2.  **Configuration at C1 (must be R):** C1 is bonded to O, C6, C2, and a methyl group. The priorities are O > C6 > C2 > CH3. For the configuration to be R, the methyl group must be on the beta face (up, wedge). If the lowest priority group (CH3) is on a wedge, we determine the direction of the remaining three (O -> C6 -> C2 is counter-clockwise, S) and reverse it to get R. This matches. So, **C1-Me is beta (up)**.\n3.  **Configuration at C6 (must be S):** C6 is bonded to O, C1, C5, and H. The priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. The epoxide is alpha (down), so the H on C6 must be beta (up, wedge) to maintain the ring structure. With the lowest priority group (H) on a wedge, we determine the direction of the remaining three (O -> C1 -> C5 is clockwise, R) and reverse it to get S. This matches. So, **C6-H is beta (up)**.\n4.  **Configuration at C3 (must be R):** C3 is bonded to C4, C2, a methyl group, and H. Priorities: C4 > C2 > CH3 > H. For a 3R configuration, the methyl group must be alpha (down, dash). If the H is on a wedge (up), the sequence C4 -> C2 -> Me is counter-clockwise (S). Reversing this gives R. This matches. So, **C3-Me is alpha (down)**.\n5.  **Configuration at C4 (must be R):** C4 is bonded to C3, C5, a methyl group, and H. Priorities: C3 > C5 > CH3 > H. For a 4R configuration, the methyl group must be beta (up, wedge). If the H is on a dash (down), the sequence C3 -> C5 -> Me is clockwise (R). This matches. So, **C4-Me is beta (up)**.\n\n**Summary of Reactant Structure:**\n*   An alpha-epoxide (pointing down).\n*   A beta-methyl group at C1 (pointing up).\n*   An alpha-methyl group at C3 (pointing down).\n*   A beta-methyl group at C4 (pointing up).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The nucleophile is a methyl anion equivalent (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that for organocuprates, the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O bond), and the attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the alpha face (down).\n    *   The Me⁻ nucleophile will attack C6 from the beta face (up).\n    *   The configuration at C6 will invert from S to R.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is not affected by the attack and is retained. The configurations at C3 and C4 are also retained.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  **Ring Opening:** The attack of Me⁻ at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻).\n2.  **Workup:** A mild acid workup (e.g., H₃O⁺ or NH₄Cl) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n3.  **Resulting Molecule:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name and Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n1.  **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules for alcohols, the carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned the lowest possible number, which is C1.\n    *   The old C1 (with the retained configuration) becomes the **new C1**.\n    *   The old C6 (where the attack and inversion occurred) becomes the **new C2**.\n    *   The numbering continues around the ring: old C5 -> new C3, old C4 -> new C4, old C3 -> new C5, old C2 -> new C6.\n2.  **Substituents on the Product:**\n    *   At new C1: an -OH group and a methyl group.\n    *   At new C2: a methyl group (from the cuprate) and a hydrogen.\n    *   At new C4: a methyl group and a hydrogen.\n    *   At new C5: a methyl group and a hydrogen.\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   **New C1 (from old C1):** Configuration is retained. Old C1 was R. -> **1R**.\n    *   **New C2 (from old C6):** Configuration is inverted. Old C6 was S. Inversion leads to R. -> **2R**.\n    *   **New C4 (from old C4):** Configuration is retained. Old C4 was R. -> **4R**.\n    *   **New C5 (from old C3):** Configuration is retained. Old C3 was R. -> **5R**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect structure and stereochemistry.\nB) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **Matches our derived product.**\nC) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2 (implies retention).\nD) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect structure (implies attack at C1).\n\nTherefore, the correct product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
