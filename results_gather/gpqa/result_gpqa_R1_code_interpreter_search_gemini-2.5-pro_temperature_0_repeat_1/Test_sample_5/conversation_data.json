    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:**\n    The given potential is V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ). This potential is described in 2D polar coordinates (r, θ). To solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often advantageous to switch to Cartesian coordinates (x, y), especially if the potential simplifies.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    From these, we can see that x^2 = (r cos(θ))^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ).\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (x^2)\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Combine the terms with x^2:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\n    V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + 1/2 k y^2\n\n4.  **Recognize the Separable Potential:**\n    The potential V(x, y) is now in the form of a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2 k x^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 k y^2\n\n    This is the potential for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the total energy E of the system will be the sum of the energies from the independent motions in the x and y directions: E = E_x + E_y.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Energy Spectrum of Each 1D Oscillator:**\n    The standard potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator is V(q) = 1/2 m ω^2 q^2, and its energy spectrum is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        We have V_x(x) = 2 k x^2. Comparing this to the standard form 1/2 m ω_x^2 x^2:\n        1/2 m ω_x^2 = 2k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k / m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n        E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        We have V_y(y) = 1/2 k y^2. Comparing this to the standard form 1/2 m ω_y^2 y^2:\n        1/2 m ω_y^2 = 1/2 k\n        ω_y^2 = k / m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n        E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y directions:\n    E = E_nx + E_ny\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\n    E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m).\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
