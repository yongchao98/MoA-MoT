    "This is a classic relativistic collision problem involving electron-positron annihilation. To solve it, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Process:**\n    *   **Initial State:** An electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺) are moving towards each other along the x-axis.\n    *   **Process:** They collide and annihilate.\n    *   **Final State:** Two photons (γ) are produced.\n\n2.  **Define Kinematic Variables (Initial State):**\n    *   Let the rest mass of both the electron and positron be $m_e$.\n    *   Let the speed of light be $c$.\n    *   **Electron (e⁻):**\n        *   Moves in the +x direction.\n        *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n        *   Energy, $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Velocity, $v_e$, is found from $\\gamma_e = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v_e/c)^2}$. This gives $(v_e/c) = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma_e^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 1/16} = \\sqrt{15}/4$.\n        *   Momentum, $p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e c (\\sqrt{15}/4) = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$. The momentum is a vector in the +x direction.\n    *   **Positron (e⁺):**\n        *   Moves in the -x direction.\n        *   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n        *   Energy, $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n        *   Velocity, $v_p$, is found from $\\gamma_p = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v_p/c)^2}$. This gives $(v_p/c) = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma_p^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 1/4} = \\sqrt{3}/2$.\n        *   Momentum, $p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e c (\\sqrt{3}/2) = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$. The momentum is a vector in the -x direction.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies:\n        $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   The final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons, $E_{\\gamma1}$ and $E_{\\gamma2}$.\n        $E_{final} = E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2}$.\n    *   The problem states the photons have the same energy, so $E_{\\gamma1} = E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$.\n    *   By conservation of energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma \\implies E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   The magnitude of a photon's momentum is related to its energy by $p = E/c$. So, the momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = (3 m_e c^2)/c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Momentum is a vector, so we must conserve it in each direction (x and y).\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum:** Both particles move along the x-axis.\n        $P_{initial, x} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n        $P_{initial, y} = 0$.\n    *   **Total Final Momentum:**\n        *   Let the first photon move at an angle $\\theta$ above the x-axis and the second at an angle $\\phi$ below the x-axis.\n        *   From the problem description (\"upper-right\" and \"lower-right\"), both have positive x-components of momentum.\n        *   **y-component conservation:**\n            $P_{final, y} = p_\\gamma \\sin(\\theta) - p_\\gamma \\sin(\\phi) = 0$.\n            Since $p_\\gamma$ is not zero, $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(\\phi)$, which means $\\theta = \\phi$. The angles with the x-axis are symmetric.\n        *   **x-component conservation:**\n            $P_{final, x} = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$.\n    *   **Equating initial and final x-momentum:**\n        $P_{initial, x} = P_{final, x}$\n        $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$.\n    *   Substitute the value of $p_\\gamma = 3 m_e c$:\n        $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$.\n        $\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos(\\theta)$.\n        $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angle:**\n    *   Now we compute the value of $\\theta$.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    # Calculate the value of cos(theta)\n    cos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n    \n    # Calculate theta in degrees\n    theta_deg = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n    \n    # The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\n    total_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n    \n    print(total_angle)\n    ```\n    *   Executing this code gives a result of approximately 138.1 degrees.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The angle $\\theta$ is the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis. The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the photons, which is $2\\theta$. The calculated value is ~138 degrees.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 96\nB) 138\nC) 172\nD) 74\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
