    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the interplanar distance `d` for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n    *   Lattice parameter (interatomic distance), `a` = 10 Angstrom\n    *   Interaxial angles, `α` = `β` = `γ` = 30°\n    *   Miller indices of the plane, `(hkl)` = (111)\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Formula:** For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` is given by:\n    \n    1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²(α) - cos(α)) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²(α) + 2cos³(α)) ]\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    *   `a` = 10\n    *   `h` = 1, `k` = 1, `l` = 1\n    *   `α` = 30°\n\n5.  **Calculate the necessary components of the formula:**\n    *   `h² + k² + l²` = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n    *   `hk + kl + lh` = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3\n    *   `a²` = 10² = 100\n    *   `α` = 30°\n        *   `sin(30°)` = 0.5\n        *   `cos(30°)` = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.8660\n    *   `sin²(30°)` = (0.5)² = 0.25\n    *   `cos²(30°)` = (√3 / 2)² = 3/4 = 0.75\n    *   `cos³(30°)` = (√3 / 2)³ = 3√3 / 8 ≈ 0.6495\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerator and Denominator of the main expression:**\n    *   **Numerator:**\n        `N = (3) * (0.25) + 2 * (3) * (0.75 - 0.8660)`\n        `N = 0.75 + 6 * (-0.1160)`\n        `N = 0.75 - 0.696`\n        `N = 0.054`\n    *   **Denominator:**\n        `D = 100 * (1 - 3 * (0.75) + 2 * (0.6495))`\n        `D = 100 * (1 - 2.25 + 1.299)`\n        `D = 100 * (0.049)`\n        `D = 4.9`\n\n7.  **Calculate 1/d²:**\n    `1/d² = N / D = 0.054 / 4.9 ≈ 0.01102`\n\n8.  **Calculate d:**\n    `d² = 1 / 0.01102 ≈ 90.74`\n    `d = √90.74 ≈ 9.526` Angstrom\n\nTo avoid rounding errors during manual calculation, it is more accurate to use a computational tool. The following Python script performs the calculation with higher precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n\n# Convert angle from degrees to radians for trigonometric functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate trigonometric values\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the formula for 1/d^2\nnumerator = (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * sin_alpha**2 + 2 * (h*k + k*l + l*h) * (cos_alpha**2 - cos_alpha)\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the formula for 1/d^2\ndenominator = a**2 * (1 - 3*cos_alpha**2 + 2*cos_alpha**3)\n\n# Calculate 1/d^2\none_over_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate d by taking the square root of the reciprocal\nd = math.sqrt(1 / one_over_d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n<execute_code>\n9.54300331133339\n</execute_code>\nThe result from the code is approximately 9.543 Angstrom.
