    "*   **Understanding the Density Matrix and Bloch Sphere**\n\n    A density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be represented as a point in a 3D space called the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix in this representation is:\n\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\n    where:\n    *   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the qubit state in the Bloch sphere. The origin of this space is (0,0,0).\n\n*   **Analyzing the Given Density Matrix**\n\n    The problem provides the density matrix:\n\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n    In the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$, the projectors are:\n    *   $|0\\rangle\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $|1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The sum of these projectors is the identity matrix:\n    $|0\\rangle\\langle 0| + |1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$\n\n    Therefore, the given density matrix simplifies to:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\n*   **Finding the Bloch Vector**\n\n    Now, we equate our simplified density matrix with the general Bloch sphere representation:\n\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\n    Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n\n    Subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z$\n\n    The Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$) are linearly independent. This means the only way their linear combination can be the zero matrix is if all the coefficients ($r_x, r_y, r_z$) are zero.\n\n    Therefore:\n    *   $r_x = 0$\n    *   $r_y = 0$\n    *   $r_z = 0$\n\n    The Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    The geometrical position of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$ in the qubit space is the origin of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to the coordinate vector r=(0,0,0). This state is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,1)\nB) r=(1,1,0)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
