    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of alcohols and, even more so, carboxylic acids.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This could indicate a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an **alkene** in the molecule's structure, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very important clue. We need to determine what common chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid functional group, -COOH:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The fragment [COOH]⁺ has an m/z of 45. This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** The presence of this fragment provides strong evidence that the unknown compound is a **carboxylic acid**.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas**\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion.\n\n*   A carboxylic acid contains a C=O double bond (1 degree of unsaturation).\n*   An alkene contains a C=C double bond (1 degree of unsaturation).\n*   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of at least **2 degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each potential formula using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula does not have enough degrees of unsaturation to be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with one C=C bond and one C=O bond. It also has two oxygen atoms, required for a carboxylic acid. This formula fits all the spectral evidence.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. While this has the correct DoU, it only has one oxygen atom. This cannot be a carboxylic acid, which contradicts the strong evidence from the FTIR and Mass Spec.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has neither the correct number of oxygens nor the correct degree of unsaturation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the provided analytical data (an unsaturated carboxylic acid) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
