    "*   **Analyze the question:** The core of the question is about \"regularization at high energies\". This is a concept from quantum field theory (QFT). Regularization is a technique used to handle infinities, specifically ultraviolet (UV) divergences, which arise in calculations involving loop diagrams. These divergences are associated with very high energies or, equivalently, very short distances. The question asks which of the listed theories does *not* need this procedure.\n\n*   **Evaluate each option:**\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It was one of the first successful QFTs. However, when calculating physical quantities beyond the simplest \"tree-level\" approximations, one encounters loop diagrams that result in infinite values. These infinities must be dealt with using regularization and a subsequent process called renormalization. Therefore, QED definitely requires regularization.\n\n    *   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force. Like QED, it is a QFT. Calculations in QCD also involve loop diagrams that lead to UV divergences. Thus, QCD also requires regularization and renormalization to make finite, physical predictions.\n\n    *   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is described by Maxwell's equations. It is a *classical* theory, not a quantum one. However, it has its own high-energy/short-distance problem. If one considers a fundamental particle like an electron to be a point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) becomes infinite. This is a divergence that occurs as the radius of the charge goes to zero. To get a finite answer, one must introduce a cutoff or \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the charge is not a point but has a small, finite radius. So, in its own way, classical electrodynamics also requires a form of regularization to deal with an inconsistency at short distances.\n\n    *   **A) Superstring Theory:** This is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity, in a quantum-mechanical way. A key feature and motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be \"UV finite\". Unlike the point particles of QFT, the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional strings. These extended objects interact over a region of spacetime rather than at a single point. This \"smearing out\" of the interaction smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to UV divergences in QFT. As a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in string theory are expected to be finite without the need for regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** QED, QCD, and even Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities at high energies (short distances) that require some form of regularization to be handled. Superstring Theory is specifically proposed as a framework that resolves this issue fundamentally and is believed not to require regularization.\n\n<<<A>>>"
