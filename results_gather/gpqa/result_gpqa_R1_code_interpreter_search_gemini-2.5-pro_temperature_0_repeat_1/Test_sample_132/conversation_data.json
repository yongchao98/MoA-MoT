    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the components of the solution:**\n*   The solution contains KH2PO4, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   It also contains Na2HPO4●2H2O, which dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n*   The key species forming the buffer are the conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base).\n\n**2. Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of each salt.\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L\n\nMoles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\nThis gives us 0.007348 mol of H2PO4-.\nConcentration of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\nThis gives us 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.\nConcentration of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer:**\nThe buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n\nWe can use the Ka2 expression to find [H+]:\nKa2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\nRearranging for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] = 8.10x10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration:**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-):\nHPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n\nThe Ka3 expression is:\nKa3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have calculated:\n*   Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n*   [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02809 M (we assume its concentration doesn't change significantly from this third, very weak dissociation)\n*   [H+] = 8.10x10^-8 M\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809) / (8.10x10^-8)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\n\n# Ka values\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Calculate [H+] using the buffer equation from Ka2\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] -> [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] using the equation from Ka3\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] -> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10^-7 M, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\nThe solution contains a buffer system made of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄ (source of H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (source of HPO₄²⁻):**\n    Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.**\nThe equilibrium governing the buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n\nWe can use the equilibrium constant expression to find [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\nRearranging for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), which is the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n\nWe use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃:\nKa₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\nRearranging to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n\nNow, we substitute the values we have calculated:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
