    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to treat a nucleon bound inside a nucleus as if it were a free particle during a high-energy interaction. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a fundamental tenet of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the incoming probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) interacts with just one nucleon at a time. It neglects more complex interactions, such as \"meson-exchange currents\" or \"two-body currents,\" where the probe interacts with a pair of nucleons or the force-carrying particles between them. Therefore, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. It posits that the incoming probe and any outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not interact with the other (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus. These are known as \"final-state interactions\" (FSI) or \"initial-state interactions.\" Ignoring them is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). This ensures that the observed final state is a direct result of the primary interaction on the single nucleon, not distorted by subsequent scatterings. Thus, this assumption is also crucial.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it within the framework of the non-relativistic quark model. The impulse approximation, however, is a statement about the nucleon's behavior *within the nuclear medium*, not about its intrinsic composition. One can apply the impulse approximation regardless of whether the nucleon's internal structure is described by a non-relativistic model, a relativistic bag model, or full Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Therefore, this is a separate physical approximation and not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The approximation assumes the interaction happens over a very short timescale, so \"impulsively\" that the nucleon does not have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the nuclear potential that binds it. During the brief moment of interaction, it behaves like a free particle, with its binding energy being negligible compared to the energy transferred in the collision. This assumption is essential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the assumptions that the interaction is a rapid event (ignoring binding forces, statement 4) that happens with a single nucleon (statement 1), and that the rest of the nucleus is a passive spectator (statement 2). Statement 3 is an unrelated approximation about the nucleon's internal structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
