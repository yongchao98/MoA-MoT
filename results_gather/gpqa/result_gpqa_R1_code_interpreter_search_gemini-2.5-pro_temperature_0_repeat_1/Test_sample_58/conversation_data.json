    "This problem requires us to calculate the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH will be determined by the component that is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol H+\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two moles of OH- per mole of Ba(OH)2: Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol OH-\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total moles of acid and base.**\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H+ equivalents):**\n    *   This includes H+ from the strong acid (HCl) and the protons from the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Total acid = Moles of H+ (from HCl) + Moles of CH3COOH\n    *   Total acid = 0.08 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.13 mol\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH- equivalents):**\n    *   Total base = Moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 mol\n\n**Step 3: Perform the neutralization reaction.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will neutralize all available acid. We compare the total moles of acid and base to see which is in excess.\n\n*   Total acid = 0.13 mol\n*   Total base = 0.18 mol\n\nSince the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH-** = Total moles of base - Total moles of acid\n*   Moles of excess OH- = 0.18 mol - 0.13 mol = 0.05 mol\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess OH-. The other species present (CH3COO-, the conjugate base of the weak acid) is a weak base, and its contribution to the overall OH- concentration is negligible compared to the excess strong base.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-.**\n\nFirst, we need the total volume of the final solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, we can calculate the molarity of the excess OH-.\n\n*   **[OH-]** = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the pOH and pH.**\n\n*   **pOH** = -log10([OH-])\n*   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial moles\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500  # Weak acid\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400 # Strong acid\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 0.3 * 0.300 * 2 # Strong base\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total moles of acid and base\ntotal_moles_acid = moles_ch3cooh + moles_h_from_hcl\ntotal_moles_base = moles_oh_from_baoh2\n\n# Step 3: Determine the excess reactant\nmoles_excess_oh = total_moles_base - total_moles_acid\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nconcentration_excess_oh = moles_excess_oh / total_volume_L\n\n# Step 5: Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_excess_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (a strong acid):**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely to yield two hydroxide ions (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**2. Determine the total moles of acid and base.**\n\n*   The strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acidic protons, both from the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):** 0.05 mol (from CH₃COOH) + 0.08 mol (from HCl) = 0.13 mol\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):** 0.18 mol\n\n**3. Identify the excess reactant.**\n\n*   Compare the total moles of acid and base:\n    *   Acid: 0.13 mol\n    *   Base: 0.18 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of base than acid, the hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is in excess.\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻:** 0.18 mol - 0.13 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n\n*   First, find the total volume of the final solution:\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n*   Now, calculate the molarity of the excess OH⁻:\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**5. Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n\n*   **pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻]**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **pH + pOH = 14**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
