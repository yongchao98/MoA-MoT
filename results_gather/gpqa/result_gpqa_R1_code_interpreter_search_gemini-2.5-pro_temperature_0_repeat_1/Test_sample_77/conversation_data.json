    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nThe scalar potential V and vector potential A at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ due to a time-varying charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ are given by:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, $t_r$ is the **retarded time**, defined by the condition that the signal (propagating at speed c) emitted at $t_r$ from position $\\vec{r}'$ reaches the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. This is expressed as:\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n*   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nThe evaluation of these integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A rigorous derivation involves a change of variables and accounts for the \"compression\" of the source volume due to the motion of the charge relative to the observer. This gives rise to a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe result of this integration is a standard result in classical electrodynamics:\n$\\int \\frac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nThe subscript \"ret\" means that all quantities inside the brackets (the charge's position $\\vec{s}$, its velocity $\\vec{v}$, and the distance $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nLet's use the notation from the problem description:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$.\n\nWith this notation, the denominator term becomes:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\hat{d}) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$\n\n### 4. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting this result back into the integral expressions for V and A, we get the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d - (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d})/c} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d})/c} \\right]$\n\nNow, we manipulate these expressions to match the format of the given options. We can factor out $1/c$ from the denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this into the potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   This is the static potential, which ignores retardation effects. Incorrect.\n\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    *   This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    *   Incorrect static potential and incorrect relation for the vector potential.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer. It's also worth noting that for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, where $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity at the retarded time. Option C satisfies this relationship, as $\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
