    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an ortho-, para-directing group or a meta-directing group. This classification determines the primary positions where the incoming bromine electrophile will attach.\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to the substituent. They typically have lone pairs to donate via resonance (like -Cl) or are electron-donating alkyl groups.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Alkyl group, activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Alkyl group, activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Halogen, deactivating but o,p-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are typically electron-withdrawing groups that contain a double or triple bond to an electronegative atom.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-directing.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing compounds**\n\nThe compounds with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will produce the meta-isomer as the major product, meaning the yield of the para-isomer will be very low. To rank them, we need to consider the strength of their deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the ortho and para isomers.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\n*   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It will give the highest yield of the meta-product and therefore the **lowest** yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The -COOH group is less deactivating than -NO2.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is the least deactivating among the three. The electron-donating nature of the -OC2H5 part slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group compared to the -OH in a carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this subset is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho-, para-directing compounds**\n\nThe compounds with ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is determined by a combination of electronic effects and steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible to the incoming electrophile. The size of the substituents increases in the order: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5. Based on sterics alone, we would expect the para yield to increase with the size of the alkyl group.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** Halogens like -Cl have a unique effect. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), they direct ortho-para due to resonance electron donation (+R effect). The inductive effect is distance-dependent and weakens the ortho position more than the para position, leading to a very high preference for para substitution.\n\nLet's look at typical experimental data for bromination:\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3):** The para-isomer yield is very high, typically around 87-88%.\n*   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** The para-isomer yield is around 67%.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, leading to slightly more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This results in a slightly higher para yield than for toluene, around 68%.\n\nBased on this data, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this subset is:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups**\n\nAny ortho-, para-directing group will produce a much higher yield of the para-isomer than any meta-directing group. Therefore, we can combine the two ordered lists from Step 2 and Step 3.\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n(4) < (6) < (2) < (1) < (5) < (3)\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
