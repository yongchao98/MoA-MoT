    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and States:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, for the two electrons, we have $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The possible values for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for a single electron in a p-orbital are given by the magnetic quantum number $m_l$, which can be -1, 0, or +1. The corresponding eigenvalues of the operator $L_z$ are $m_l \\hbar$, i.e., $-\\hbar, 0, +\\hbar$.\n    *   The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   The eigenstates of these measurements are the *uncoupled* states, denoted by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles of Quantum Mechanics:**\n    *   The probability of measuring a particular outcome is given by the square of the absolute value of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that outcome.\n    *   In this case, the probability $P$ is:\n        $P = |<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m>|^2$\n    *   Substituting the given values:\n        $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    *   The term inside the absolute value, $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$, is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n4.  **Use the Conservation of Angular Momentum (Selection Rule):**\n    *   A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   For the operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   For the corresponding quantum numbers, this means: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   This relationship acts as a selection rule. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, and thus the probability, is non-zero only if the quantum numbers satisfy this condition.\n    *   Let's check this condition for our problem:\n        *   From the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n        *   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        *   The sum of the individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Now, we compare $m$ with the sum $m_1 + m_2$:\n        *   $m = -1$\n        *   $m_1 + m_2 = -2$\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the inner product (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) is zero:\n        $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is:\n        $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n    *   It is impossible to measure the individual z-components as $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ when the total system is in a state with $m = -1$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
