    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. For distances far from the source (the radiation zone), the radiation can be described by a multipole expansion. The dominant term in this expansion is typically the lowest-order non-vanishing multipole moment.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Dominant Radiation Type:**\n    The source is a spheroid-shaped charge distribution oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis). This oscillation creates a time-varying electric dipole moment, `p(t)`, along the z-axis. Since the electric dipole moment is changing with time (`d²p/dt² ≠ 0`), it will radiate. The electric dipole is the lowest-order multipole, and since it is non-zero for this configuration, its radiation will dominate over higher-order multipoles like the electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole (unless the dipole moment is specifically made to be zero, which is not the case here).\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Dipole Radiation:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment.\n\n    The function `f` in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\n    The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * (1) = C`.\n\n    We need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n    At `θ = 30°`, the power is:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    So, `(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) = C * (1/4) = A / 4`.\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n3.  **Wavelength Dependence of Dipole Radiation:**\n    The full formula for the power per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `c` is the speed of light, and `μ₀` is the permeability of free space.\n\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2πc/λ`.\n    Therefore, the power is proportional to `ω⁴`:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    Substituting the relation for `λ`:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n\n    So, a possible form for the dependence of the function `f` on wavelength `λ` is `λ⁻⁴`. This is the characteristic dependence for Rayleigh scattering and electric dipole radiation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that they correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
