    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH)\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, specifically a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction or a variation thereof. The reaction brominates the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group (the α-carbon).\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid is brominated at its α-carbon (the methyl group).\n    CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH)\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxyl group of bromoacetic acid is esterified with ethanol.\n    BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN)\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization (a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction).\n    1.  **First Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)5Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since *excess* NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other bromine-bearing carbon at the end of the pentyl chain in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon atom. The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure of 4:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n    C1 -- C -- COO-CH2-CH3\n      /   \\\n    CH2   CH2\n    |     |\n    CH2   CH2\n      \\   /\n       CH2\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry and Dynamics:** At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This conformational change averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon. The molecule, when time-averaged, possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the opposite carbon), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-CH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **one signal** (a triplet).\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are also equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **one signal** (a quartet).\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes the two CH2 groups at C2 and C6 equivalent. Due to rapid chair flipping, the four protons on these two carbons become chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale. This gives **one signal**.\n        *   Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the two CH2 groups at C3 and C5 equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons are also averaged by the chair flip, resulting in **one signal**.\n        *   The CH2 group at C4 is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on this carbon are equivalent and will produce **one signal**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Summing up the distinct signals:\n    1 (from ethyl CH3) + 1 (from ethyl CH2) + 1 (from C2/C6 protons) + 1 (from C3/C5 protons) + 1 (from C4 protons) = **5 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 5 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product 4.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
