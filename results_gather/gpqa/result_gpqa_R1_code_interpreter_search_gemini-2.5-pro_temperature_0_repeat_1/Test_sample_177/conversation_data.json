    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### **1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we work in natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$. In these units, mass, energy, and momentum all have the same dimension, which we denote as $[M]$. Length and time have the inverse dimension, $[L] = [T] = [M^{-1}]$.\n\nThe action, $S$, is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$, over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe action must be a dimensionless quantity. The spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of (length)$^4$, so its mass dimension is $[d^4x]_M = [L^4]_M = [M^{-4}]$.\n\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension that cancels this out. Therefore, the mass dimension of $\\mathcal{L}$ must be 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$\n\n### **2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nTo find the dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$, we first need the dimensions of the other components of the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$. We can deduce these from their standard kinetic terms, which must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic, \\psi} = \\bar{\\psi} i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has the dimension of inverse length, so its mass dimension is $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices.\n    *   The fields $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ have the same mass dimension: $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M$.\n    *   For the kinetic term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have:\n        $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4$\n        $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$\n        $2[\\psi]_M = 3 \\implies [\\psi]_M = 3/2$\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic, A} = -\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have:\n        $[F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n        $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4 \\implies [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless, their commutator $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless.\n    $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$\n\n### **3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can analyze the interaction term given in the problem:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\kappa \\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nLike any other term in the Lagrangian density, this term must have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension ($[g]_M > 0$), the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension ($[g]_M = 0$), the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension ($[g]_M < 0$), the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this case, $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory described by this interaction is non-renormalizable. Such terms are typically interpreted as low-energy effective interactions that arise from a more fundamental, renormalizable theory at a higher energy scale.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
