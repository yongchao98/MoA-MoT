    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a powerful technique in electrostatics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by a simpler system. We replace the entire sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge,\" let's call it `q'`, placed at a specific point `b` inside the sphere's original volume. The problem then becomes finding the potential and field of two point charges, `q` and `q'`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface of radius `R` is zero, matching the \"grounded\" condition. For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center, the image charge and its position are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, along the line connecting the center to `q`).\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. An elegant way to calculate this energy is using the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    *   `V_induced` is the potential at the final location of the charge `q` that is created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, \"other charges\" are the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n    *   The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are not constant; they build up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity. The work done is against a potential that is, on average, half of its final value.\n\n5.  **Calculating V_induced:**\n    According to the method of images, the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The image charge `q'` is at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `distance = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    Now, we can find the potential at `d` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    where `k = 1 / (4πε₀)`.\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and the distance:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\n    The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of U:**\n    Now, substitute this `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    Let's examine the given choices:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\n    Our derived result, `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`, matches option C perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
