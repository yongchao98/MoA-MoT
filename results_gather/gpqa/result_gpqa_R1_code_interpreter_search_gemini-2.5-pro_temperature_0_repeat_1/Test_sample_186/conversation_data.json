    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT 8m telescope, we need to check two criteria for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### Step 1: Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. A star is generally considered observable if its declination (DEC) is greater than the observatory's latitude minus 90 degrees.\nObservability limit: DEC > -24.6° - 90° = -114.6°.\nHowever, for high-quality observations, the star should ideally be well above the horizon. A common rule of thumb is that the star's declination should be less than the observatory's latitude + 45 degrees for good observability, but for our purposes, we will check if the star is ever visible.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Declination (DEC) ≈ -52° 41'. This is well within the observable range for Paranal.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Declination (DEC) ≈ +89° 15'. This star is very close to the North Celestial Pole and is not visible from the Southern Hemisphere's latitude of -24.6°. Therefore, Polaris is not detectable.\n*   **c), d), e), f):** These stars are all located at a Declination (DEC) of 0°. This is on the celestial equator, which is easily observable from Paranal.\n\nSo, based on visibility, Polaris is out. We are left with stars a, c, d, e, and f.\n\n### Step 2: Brightness and S/N Calculation\n\nThe detection criterion is an S/N of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure. We need to find the apparent V magnitude (m_V) for each star and compare it to the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO for this S/N and exposure time.\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) and performance documentation, for the 1-UT mode (using one 8m VLT), an S/N of 10 in a 1-hour (3600s) exposure is achieved for a star with an apparent V magnitude of approximately **m_V = 16.5**. Any star brighter than this (i.e., with a V magnitude less than 16.5) will be detectable.\n\nNow let's calculate the apparent magnitude for each star.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky. Its apparent V magnitude is -0.74. Since -0.74 < 16.5, Canopus is easily detectable.\n\n*   **For stars c, d, e, f:** We use the distance modulus formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d).\n    *   Formula: m_V = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d)\n    *   Given: Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 15\n\n    *   **c) d = 10 pc:**\n        m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) = 10 + 5 * 1 = 15.0\n        Since 15.0 < 16.5, this star is detectable.\n\n    *   **d) d = 200 pc:**\n        m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200) = 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.505 = 21.505\n        Since 21.505 > 16.5, this star is **not** detectable.\n\n    *   **e) d = 5 pc:**\n        m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) = 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.495 = 13.495\n        Since 13.495 < 16.5, this star is detectable.\n\n    *   **f) d = 50 pc:**\n        m_V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50) = 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.495 = 18.495\n        Since 18.495 > 16.5, this star is **not** detectable.\n\n### Summary of Results:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Visible and bright enough. **(Detectable)**\n*   **b) Polaris:** Not visible. **(Not Detectable)**\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** Visible and bright enough (m_V = 15.0). **(Detectable)**\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** Visible but not bright enough (m_V = 21.5). **(Not Detectable)**\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** Visible and bright enough (m_V = 13.5). **(Detectable)**\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** Visible but not bright enough (m_V = 18.5). **(Not Detectable)**\n\nIn total, there are 3 detectable stars: Canopus, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 10 pc.\n\n<<<A>>>"
