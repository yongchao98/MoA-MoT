    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the information given about the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integrations for each of the four possible compounds. This is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. Neither has an adjacent proton. This results in two separate **singlets**. Integration: 1H each.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in three separate **singlets**. Integration ratio: 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent to each other. However, they are adjacent and will couple, forming an AB quartet or a pair of **doublets**. They are not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: {C1, C4} and {C2, C3}. This gives two **singlets**. Integration: 6H each.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic pair of doublets (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, similar to durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are equivalent, giving one **singlet**. Integration: 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons, giving a **quartet** (4H). The CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons, giving a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options Based on the Mixture's Spectrum**\n\nThe problem states the mixture's spectrum contains only singlets. This immediately allows us to eliminate any options containing compounds that produce other multiplicities.\n\n*   **Eliminate options with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** This compound produces doublets in the aromatic region. The observed spectrum has only singlets. This rules out options B and D.\n*   **Eliminate options with 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound produces a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. The observed spectrum has only singlets. This rules out option A.\n\n### **4. Confirm the Remaining Option (C)**\n\nThe only remaining option is C, which is a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two can produce the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Total Protons in the Mixture:**\n    *   Both are isomers with 2 aromatic H and 12 alkyl H.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, we have a total of 4 aromatic H and 24 alkyl H.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   **Observed:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. With 4 total aromatic protons, this means we have a **2H singlet** and another **2H singlet**.\n    *   **From the mixture:**\n        *   Durene contributes one **2H singlet**.\n        *   Isodurene contributes two **1H singlets**.\n    *   **Reconciliation:** If the two 1H singlets from Isodurene are \"accidentally degenerate\" (meaning they have the same chemical shift by chance), they will appear as a single 2H singlet. This, combined with the 2H singlet from Durene, gives two 2H singlets in total. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n    *   **Observed:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. With 24 total alkyl protons, the integrations must be **12H, 6H, and 6H**. (Let the ratio be 2x:1x:1x. Then 4x = 24, so x = 6).\n    *   **From the mixture:**\n        *   Durene contributes one **12H singlet**.\n        *   Isodurene contributes three singlets: one **6H singlet** and two **3H singlets**.\n    *   **Reconciliation:** We can assemble the observed signals:\n        1.  The **12H singlet** comes from Durene.\n        2.  The first **6H singlet** comes from the C1/C3 methyl groups of Isodurene.\n        3.  The second **6H singlet** is formed if the two 3H singlets from Isodurene (from C2 and C5 methyls) are accidentally degenerate, appearing as a single combined signal.\n    *   This combination also perfectly matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that can produce the observed spectrum, assuming two instances of accidental degeneracy in the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
