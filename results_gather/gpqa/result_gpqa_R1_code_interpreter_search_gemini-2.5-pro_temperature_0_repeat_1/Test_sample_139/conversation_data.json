    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This immediately suggests the presence of isotopes like Deuterium (D or ²H), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc. The context of a violent reaction often points towards deuterated hydrides.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential simple gases produced in reactions:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D has 1p, 1n. The D₂ molecule has **2 protons, 2 neutrons**. (Yes)\n        *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. (No)\n        *   N₂: Each N has 7p, 7n. The N₂ molecule has **14 protons, 14 neutrons**. (Yes)\n        *   CO: C (6p, 6n), O (8p, 8n). The CO molecule has **14 protons, 14 neutrons**. (Yes)\n        *   HF: H (1p, 0n), F (9p, 10n). The HF molecule has **10 protons, 10 neutrons**. (Yes)\n        Given the \"heavier isotope\" clue, D₂ is the most probable candidate for gas W.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   277 K is approximately 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n        *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n        *   If heating precipitate G releases D₂O, then G must be a deuterated compound, likely a metal deuteroxide (like M(OD)ₓ) or a salt hydrated with D₂O.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify X, Y, and the Reaction:**\n\n    *   We have established that the reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and involves D₂O (B). This confirms the system is rich in deuterium.\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂(g) + G(s)\n    *   G is a precipitate that yields D₂O upon heating, so G is likely a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   To produce D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide, a plausible reaction is between a powerful deuteride reducing agent (X) and heavy water (Y).\n    *   Let's test common deuterated reagents used in organic chemistry (another clue). The most prominent are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs (LiAlH₄, NaBH₄) are extremely common.\n\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis: X = LiAlD₄**\n\n    *   **Analog Clue:** The analog of LiAlD₄ is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). The clue states \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" LiAlH₄ is arguably one of the most famous and powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry, fitting this clue perfectly.\n    *   **Reaction Clue:** Let's assume liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O. The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O is known to be violent.\n        *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum Deuteroxide), which is a solid precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. This matches.\n        *   **Substance B:** Heating G (Al(OD)₃) causes decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The released substance is D₂O (B), which has a melting point of ~277 K. This matches.\n\n    *   **Keto Acid Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a general structure like R-C(=O)-COOH, containing 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone (C=O) and the carboxylic acid (COOH) functional groups.\n        *   The reaction proceeds as: R-C(=O)-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄, 2. H₃O⁺ workup)--> R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH).\n        *   The final organic product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol, -OH, groups). A diol contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is perfectly satisfied.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of Identification:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)\". It also specifies that if there are multiple atoms of an element, their masses should be summed.\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   **Atomic Masses (using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes):**\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): Mass ≈ 2 amu\n        *   Lithium (⁷Li is the most common isotope): Mass ≈ 7 amu\n        *   Aluminum (²⁷Al is the only stable isotope): Mass ≈ 27 amu\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:**\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (represented by its isotope D, mass 2).\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (mass 27).\n    *   **Sum the masses according to the formula LiAlD₄:**\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are 4 Deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 Aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
