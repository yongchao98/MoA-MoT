    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main objective is to eliminate an \"anti-nutritional compound.\" The problem states this compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective way to eliminate the compound is to completely disrupt the function of the protein. This is typically achieved by making the gene produce a non-functional or truncated protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Gene and Mutations:**\n    *   The gene starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the standard start codon (Methionine).\n    *   The gene ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is a stop codon.\n    *   The mutations are all located near the beginning of the gene, in the first exon. This is important because a mutation early in the sequence can have a more drastic effect on the final protein product.\n    *   I need to examine each mutation and determine its likely effect on the protein. The most disruptive mutation will be the best candidate.\n\n3.  **Establish the \"Intact\" Baseline:**\n    *   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’`\n    *   To understand the changes, I'll translate this sequence into its amino acid sequence. I'll break the DNA sequence into three-letter codons.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   `ACT` -> Threonine (Thr)\n    *   **Intact Protein (start):** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Compare to Intact: `ATG TTT CTC...` vs `ATG TTC TAC...`\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **synonymous (silent) mutation**. No change in the amino acid.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid.\n        *   **Effect:** The protein will have one amino acid difference (Leucine to Tyrosine) near the beginning. This *might* affect protein function, but it's not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein will still be produced at full length. This is not the most reliable way to knock out function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Compare to Intact: `ATG TTT CTC...` vs `ATG TTC TAA...`\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu). `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon. The ribosome will stop translation after the second amino acid. The resulting \"protein\" will only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this short is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n        *   Compare to Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` vs `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. Missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr).\n        *   Codon 6: `ACT` -> `GTC`. `ACT` codes for Threonine (Thr), while `GTC` codes for Valine (Val). This is another **missense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** The protein has two amino acid changes. Like Mutant 1, this might alter function, but it's less certain to completely eliminate it compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...-3’`\n        *   Intact Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...-3’`\n        *   Let's compare the lengths of the provided segments. Intact is 45 bases, Mutant 4 is 42 bases. This indicates a deletion of 3 bases. A deletion of 3 bases (or a multiple of 3) is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one or more amino acids but does not shift the reading frame for the rest of the sequence.\n        *   Let's align the codons:\n            *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n            *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...)\n        *   It appears there is a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`, changing Leu to Tyr) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon (which codes for Glycine).\n        *   **Effect:** The resulting protein is missing one amino acid (Glycine) and has another one changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this will likely alter the protein's structure and function, the rest of the protein is translated in the correct frame. It is less likely to be completely non-functional than the severely truncated protein from Mutant 2.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The goal is to *eliminate* the compound, which requires eliminating the protein's function.\n    *   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in full-length (or near full-length) proteins with one or more amino acid changes/deletions. These mutations *might* knock out function, but they might also just reduce it or have no significant effect.\n    *   Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This leads to the production of a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment instead of a full protein. This is the most definitive and reliable way, among the given options, to ensure the protein is non-functional.\n    *   Therefore, Mutant 2 is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
