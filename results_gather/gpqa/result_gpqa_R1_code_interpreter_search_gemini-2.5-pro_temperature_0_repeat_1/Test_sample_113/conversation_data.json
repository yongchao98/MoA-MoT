    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two main steps.\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH3CH2C(=O)CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3CH2C(O⁻)(CN)CH3`\n        2.  This alkoxide intermediate is then protonated by a proton source to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding the cyanohydrin product.\n            `CH3CH2C(O⁻)(CN)CH3 + H⁺ → CH3CH2C(OH)(CN)CH3` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be the source of protons (H⁺) needed for the second step.\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (Sodium bisulfite) is incorrect. It reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction.\n        *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., from HCl or H₂SO₄). This provides the necessary protons to complete the cyanohydrin formation. In practice, the reaction is often carried out by mixing the ketone and NaCN, and then slowly adding acid. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺ is the correct choice.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n        *   `R-C≡N + 2 H₂O + H⁺ --(heat)--> R-COOH + NH₄⁺` (Acid-catalyzed)\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, along with water, acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not effective for nitrile hydrolysis.\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   Therefore, B = HCl is the correct choice.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, the required reagent A is `H₃O⁺`.\n    *   For the second reaction, the required reagent B is `HCl`.\n    *   Combining these, we find that the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
