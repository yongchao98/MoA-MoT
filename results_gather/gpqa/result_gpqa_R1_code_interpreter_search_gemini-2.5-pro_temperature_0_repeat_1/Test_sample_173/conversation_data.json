    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Since it's at rest, its initial momentum `P_initial` is 0.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1):\n    `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2):\n    `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy is conserved. The initial energy is the rest-mass energy of the nucleus. The final energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `M * c^2 = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n    `M * c^2 = (m1 + m2) * c^2 + (T1 + T2)`\n\n    The total kinetic energy `T_total = T1 + T2` is the energy released in the fission, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies (the \"mass defect\").\n    `T_total = M * c^2 - (m1 + m2) * c^2`\n    `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    `T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum is conserved.\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `0 = p1 + p2`\n    This implies that the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nAlso, the total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting this into the first equation gives:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`. Therefore:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have two unknowns, `T1` and `T2`, and two equations:\n1.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n2.  `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV` => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Classical Mechanics (Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, so `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n\nThis gives us the ratio of kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference is `Delta_T1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n`Delta_T1 = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Delta_T1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo confirm the calculation:\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nE0 = 300\n\n# Rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * E0\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * E0\n\n# Total kinetic energy released in GeV\nT_total = E0 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1\n# We solve the quadratic equation derived from momentum conservation:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1_c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2_c2\n# where T2 = T_total - T1\n# This simplifies to a linear equation:\n# (2*m1_c2 + 2*m2_c2) * T1 = T_total^2 + 2*T_total*m2_c2\n# Let's re-derive the linear equation from the text to be sure:\n# T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99\n# T1^2 + 396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + T1^2 + 594 - 198*T1\n# 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n# 600*T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = 603 / 600\n\n# Classical calculation for T1\n# T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2\n# T1_classical + T2_classical = T_total\n# T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = T_total\n# 3*T1_classical = T_total\nT1_classical = T_total / 3\n\n# Difference in GeV\ndiff_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Difference in MeV\ndiff_MeV = diff_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{diff_MeV=}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\ndiff_MeV=5.0\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation confirms that the difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Define Initial and Final State Parameters**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given the mass ratio: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` (for `m1`) and `T2` (for `m2`).\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses and Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies in terms of the initial energy:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n    `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`):\n    `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n    `T_total = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n    `T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    `P_initial = P_final = 0`\n    `p1 + p2 = 0`\n    This means the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n\nThis gives us the ratio of kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum relation gives:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`. Therefore:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have two unknowns, `T1` and `T2`, and two equations:\n1.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n2.  `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV` => `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**6.

We convert GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n`ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
