    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\n*   The relative speed (v_rel) between them.\n*   The total energy (E_total) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n*   Astronaut 1: Rest mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Astronaut 2: Rest mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Both velocities are in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):**\nSince the speeds are relativistic, we must use the Lorentz velocity subtraction formula. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v1` and `v2` as measured from a stationary frame, the relative velocity `v_rel` is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3 * c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7) * c`\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857... c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):**\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by `E = γ * m_0 * c^2`, where `m_0` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n\n**a. Calculate the energy of Astronaut 1 (E1):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 (`γ1`):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v1)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ1 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n    `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n    `E1 = 2.5 * mc^2`\n\n**b. Calculate the energy of Astronaut 2 (E2):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 (`γ2`):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 3.4641 * mc^2`\n\n**c. Calculate the total energy (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = (2.5 * mc^2) + (3.4641 * mc^2)`\n*   `E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) * mc^2`\n*   `E_total = 5.9641 * mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**5. Compare with Options:**\n*   Calculated `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Calculated `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese results match option B.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nm = 1 # We can use a placeholder for m since it's a common factor\nc = 1 # We can use a placeholder for c since it's a common factor\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Part 1: Calculate Relative Speed ---\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\nv_rel_numerator = v1 - v2\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\nv_rel = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# --- Part 2: Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Formula: E = gamma * m0 * c^2\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\n# Energy of astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2) / (c**2))\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * (c**2)\n\n# Energy of astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2) / (c**2))\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * (c**2)\n\n# Total energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\n# Print the results in the format of the options\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
