    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structure of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the number of rings and/or pi (Ï€) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring with one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   A C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   A C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   A C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   A C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nBy summing up these contributions, we can find the IHD of the starting material:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n**2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known for its ability to carry out the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n\nSpecifically, the Red P + HI reagent will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (specifically, a -CH3 group).\n*   Reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (specifically, a -CH3 group).\n*   Reduce alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of the Red P + HI reagent to our reactant:\n*   The **formyl group's C=O bond** will be reduced.\n*   The **carboxylic acid group's C=O bond** will be reduced, and the -OH will be replaced by -H. The entire -COOH group becomes a -CH3 group.\n*   The **vinyl group's C=C bond** will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The **C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n\nThe original carbon skeleton, which includes the six-membered ring, remains intact. All the pi bonds are removed by the reduction. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the ring itself.\n\nTherefore, the product is a substituted **cyclohexane**. It is a saturated cycloalkane, meaning it contains only single bonds, but it still has a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the product can be determined from its final structure.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   Number of pi bonds = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product.\n*   The reactant has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 in the -COOH, 1 in the -CHO, and 2 in the vinyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n*   The reduction does not change the number of carbon atoms. So, the product also has 10 carbon atoms.\n*   Since the product is a simple cycloalkane (a monocyclic saturated hydrocarbon), its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   For n=10, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\nNow, we can use the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
