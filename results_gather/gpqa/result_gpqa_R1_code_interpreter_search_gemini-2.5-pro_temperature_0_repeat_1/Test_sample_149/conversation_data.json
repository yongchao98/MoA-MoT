    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) corresponds to a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O) as suggested by the oxygen atom and NMR data.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (n=2 protons on the adjacent carbon).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n=1). The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic CH2 group that is also alpha to a carbonyl. This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (typical aromatic protons are > 7.0 ppm), suggesting the ring is substituted with at least one strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to the aromatic ring. An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethanal group (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is the standard procedure for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** 2-(4-diazoniophenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O (gentle warming)**\n    *   The diazonium salt is treated with water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves the reaction of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This aldehyde has acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a nucleophilic enolate ion.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond and, after protonation, yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons.\n        4.  **Final Product:** The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is stabilized by conjugation between the new C=C double bond and the C=O double bond of the aldehyde. The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option C).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal into 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. While the aldol addition product (Option D) is formed as an intermediate, the specified condition of \"Heat\" drives the reaction to completion via dehydration, yielding the more thermodynamically stable α,β-unsaturated condensation product (Option C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
