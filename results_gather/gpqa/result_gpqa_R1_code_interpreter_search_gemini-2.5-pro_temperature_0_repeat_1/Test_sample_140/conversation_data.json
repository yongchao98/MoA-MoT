    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate via an elimination-addition mechanism.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, and the amide ion (:NH2-) is the active species.\n\n**2. Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (Benzyne formation)**\n\nThe first step is an elimination reaction to form a highly reactive intermediate called benzyne. The strong base, :NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide ion can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. This leads to two different elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n\n1.  The amide ion (:NH2-) removes the proton (H+) from C6.\n2.  This creates a carbanion at C6.\n3.  The carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C1.\n4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n```\n      Br                      Br                      (Benzyne A)\n      |                       |                       3-deuteriobenzyne\n C1---C2-D       - H+      C1---C2-D       - Br-\n ||   |         (from C6)   ||   |                     D\n |    |          ----->     |    |          ----->    / \\\nHC6---C3H                   (-)C6--C3H                 C----C\n |    |                                              //   //\n ...                                                 C----C\n                                                      \\  /\n                                                       C==C (triple bond C1-C6)\n```\n\n**Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n\n1.  The amide ion (:NH2-) removes the deuteron (D+) from C2.\n2.  This creates a carbanion at C2.\n3.  The carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C1.\n4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this process. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n*Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), abstraction of H+ (Pathway A) is significantly faster than the abstraction of D+ (Pathway B). However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways.*\n\n**3. Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (:NH2-), now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH3).\n\n**Addition to Benzyne A (3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n\nThe amide ion can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n\n*   **Attack at C1:** The :NH2- group adds to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 gives a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n*   **Attack at C6:** The :NH2- group adds to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 gives a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. According to IUPAC nomenclature for anilines, the carbon with the -NH2 group is C1. Therefore, the original C6 is now C1, C1 is C2, and C2 is C3. The deuterium is at C3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\nSo, Pathway A leads to two distinct products: **2-deuterioaniline** and **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n**Addition to Benzyne B (benzyne):**\n\nThe amide ion attacks the C1-C2 triple bond.\n\n*   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Since the benzyne is symmetrical, attack at C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion, which upon protonation by NH3 yields a single product. This product has no deuterium. This is **aniline**.\n\nSo, Pathway B leads to one product: **aniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we get three unique organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
