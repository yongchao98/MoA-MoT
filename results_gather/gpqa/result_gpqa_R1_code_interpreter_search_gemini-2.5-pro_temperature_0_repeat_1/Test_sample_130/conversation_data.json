    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This high symmetry and the chemical shifts are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The two vinylic protons are equivalent (giving one ¹H signal), and due to symmetry, there is only one type of vinylic carbon and one type of carbonyl carbon.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Its structure is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3, a methyl group on each of carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The four methyl groups from the diene are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3).\n    *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the one-carbon bridge (C7).\n    *   The maleic anhydride part forms the other two-carbon bridge, creating a fused anhydride ring at positions C5 and C6.\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:**\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Major vs. Minor Product):** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*. According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* isomer is the kinetically favored product and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* isomer is the thermodynamically more stable product and is the **minor product**.\n    *   In the **endo isomer**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   In the **exo isomer**, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n**3. Analyze the NMR Spectra and Symmetry**\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The resulting product, in both *endo* and *exo* forms, possesses a plane of symmetry (it is a *meso* compound). This plane passes through the C7 bridge, the oxygen of the anhydride ring, and bisects the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   **Predicted ¹H NMR Signals:** Due to this symmetry, pairs of protons and methyl groups are chemically equivalent. We expect four distinct signals:\n    1.  A singlet for the two equivalent bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bh on C1/C4).\n    2.  A singlet for the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups (Me_v on C2/C3).\n    3.  A singlet for the two equivalent protons on the C7 bridge (H_bridge).\n    4.  A singlet for the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part (H_anhydride on C5/C6).\n*   **Predicted Chemical Shifts (based on typical values and literature data):**\n    *   **H_anhydride (2H singlet):** Protons alpha to a carbonyl. ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   **Me_v (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyls. ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   **H_bridge (2H singlet):** Protons on the C7 bridge. ~1.5 ppm.\n    *   **Me_bh (6H singlet):** Bridgehead methyls. ~1.0 ppm.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak:** The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n*   **Spatial Analysis:**\n    *   **Endo Isomer:** The anhydride protons (H_anhydride) are tucked \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond. This brings them close to:\n        1.  The vinylic methyls (Me_v).\n        2.  The bridge protons (H_bridge).\n    *   **Exo Isomer:** The anhydride protons (H_anhydride) are pointed away from the double bond and the C7 bridge. They are now far from Me_v and H_bridge, but they become close to the bridgehead methyls (Me_bh).\n*   Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and either **Me_v** or **H_bridge** would be strong for the major (*endo*) product and weak or absent for the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's match our predicted signals and interactions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to an interaction between H_bridge (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhydride (~3.5 ppm). While the interaction is chemically correct for distinguishing the isomers, the description of the H_bridge signal as a \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent with the molecule's symmetry, which dictates a \"2H singlet\".\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to an interaction between the vinylic methyls (Me_v) and the anhydride protons (H_anhydride). This interaction is expected to be strong in the *endo* isomer and weak in the *exo* isomer. The signal descriptions (6H singlet, 2H singlet) and chemical shifts (~1.7 ppm, ~3.5 ppm) are perfectly consistent with our analysis of the major product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is an interaction between the bridgehead methyls (Me_bh) and the vinylic methyls (Me_v). The distance between these groups is fixed by the rigid bicyclic frame and should be nearly identical in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. Therefore, this NOE peak would not be the key differentiator.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This option also contains the inconsistent \"1H doublet\" description.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B is the only choice that presents a chemically correct interaction for distinguishing the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) isomers and provides spectroscopic descriptions (multiplicity, integration, and chemical shift) that are fully consistent with the known structure and symmetry of the major product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
