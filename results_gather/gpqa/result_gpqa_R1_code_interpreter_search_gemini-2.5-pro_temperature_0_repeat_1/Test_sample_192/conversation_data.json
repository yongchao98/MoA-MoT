    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". In astronomical contexts, this typically refers to the number of stars found per unit interval of parallax. Let's denote the number of stars as `N` and the parallax as `plx`. So, this statement can be written as a proportionality for the number density with respect to parallax:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, `r`, per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Establish the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    From this, we can also write `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Differentiation:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule. This is essentially a change of variables for the number density function.\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since number density cannot be negative, we are interested in the magnitude of this change. So, we use the absolute value of the derivative (the Jacobian of the transformation):\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Quantities into the Chain Rule Formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n    *   `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express the Entire Relation in Terms of Distance `r`:**\n    The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` using `plx = 1/r`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `1 / (1/r)⁵ = 1 / (1/r⁵) = r⁵`\n    So, the expression becomes:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, varies as the cube of the distance, `r³`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
