    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\n    The ratio is:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, these terms cancel out.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((1/a_1) / (1/a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observables:** The semi-major axis `a` can be related to the observed radial velocity (RV) of the star. The maximum RV shift is the RV amplitude, K_star.\n    The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r):\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    The RV amplitude K_star is therefore:\n    K_star = (Δλ_max / λ₀) * c\n\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two planets is:\n    K_star1 / K_star2 = [(Δλ₁ / λ₀) * c] / [(Δλ₂ / λ₀) * c] = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n    Given Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å and Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å:\n    K_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\n5.  **Derive the Semi-Major Axis Formula:** The star's RV amplitude (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K_star = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where M_p is the planet mass, M_star is the star mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and v_p is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    Since the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume the inclination `i` is close to 90° (sin(i) ≈ 1) and is the same for both planets.\n    The planet's orbital velocity for a circular orbit is v_p = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a).\n    Since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.\n    v_p ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n    Substituting v_p into the K_star formula:\n    K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K_star ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n    Now, we solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    K_star² ≈ (M_p² / M_star) * (G / a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K_star²)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K_star₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K_star₁²)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K_star₂²) / (M_p₁² / K_star₁²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K_star₁ / K_star₂)²\n\n    We have the following ratios from the problem statement:\n    *   M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n    *   K_star₁ / K_star₂ = 3/4\n\n    Substitute these values into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25/49) * (9/16)\n    a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the temperature ratio formula.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n8.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    This value is approximately 0.53.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given mass ratio M_p2 / M_p1\nmass_ratio_p2_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Given Doppler shift ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n# This is equal to the radial velocity amplitude ratio K_star1 / K_star2\nk_star_ratio_1_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a_2 / a_1 is derived as:\n# a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\na_ratio_2_1 = (mass_ratio_p2_p1)**2 * (k_star_ratio_1_2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\ntemp_ratio_1_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio_1_2)\n```\n>0.5357142857142857\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
