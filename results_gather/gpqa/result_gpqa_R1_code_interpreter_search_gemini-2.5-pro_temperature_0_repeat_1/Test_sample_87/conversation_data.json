    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental setup and its results.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus, tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Observation 1:** Fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a key component of GALT and are secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated. The fluorescence indicates the antigen has reached these sites.\n    *   **Observation 2:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from these patches. In secondary lymphoid organs, antigen presentation leads to the activation and rapid proliferation of B cells, forming structures called germinal centers.\n    *   **Observation 3:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the immunological processes listed in the options:**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors (BCRs) and T cell receptors (TCRs). It occurs in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during their development, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ. Therefore, VDJ recombination is not the correct process.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* affect the variable region, which determines antigen specificity. The question specifically states high variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene. Therefore, class switching is not the primary cause of the observed variability in the variable region.\n    *   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune system where a cascade of plasma proteins is activated to fight infection. It does not involve any genetic changes to B cells.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells proliferating within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations at a very high rate specifically into the genes encoding the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. B cells with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and differentiate, a process known as affinity maturation. The \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of \"proliferating cells\" in a Peyer's patch is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The experimental observations perfectly match the description of somatic hypermutation occurring in a germinal center reaction within a Peyer's patch in response to an oral antigen.\n\n<<<D>>>"
