    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the experimental data to identify the decomposition products and their quantities.**\n\n*   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes in succession.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to test for acidic gases like CO₂. The weight of the tube did not change, which means no CO₂ was present in the gas mixture. This tells us the original salts A and B do not contain carbon (e.g., they are not carbonates or oxalates).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted. The weight increased by 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base (Ca(OH)₂), or hot copper. This indicates it is a relatively inert gas. Given that the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts often produces nitrogen gas (N₂), it is the most likely candidate for Gas C.\n\n**2. Verify the products using the law of conservation of mass.**\n\n*   Let's calculate the total mass of the gaseous products we've identified: H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = Moles of N₂ × Molar mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification and quantification of the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct.\n\n**3. Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture.**\n\n*   The initial mixture of salts A and B must contain all the atoms found in the products.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** All H comes from the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** All N comes from the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol from H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n**4. Identify the salts A and B.**\n\n*   The initial mixture contains N, H, and O. This strongly suggests ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\n*   The problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning moles(A) = moles(B). Let this be 'n'.\n*   The total amount of each element is the sum from n moles of A and n moles of B.\n*   The overall molar ratio of elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20: N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined empirical formula for (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   We need to split this formula into two plausible, equimolar salt formulas.\n    *   Let's try combining ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Formula of NH₄NO₃: N₂H₄O₃\n    *   Formula of NH₄NO₂: N₂H₄O₂\n    *   Sum of formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\n*   This is a perfect match. So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**5. Verify the decomposition reactions.**\n\n*   Let's check if the decomposition of these two salts produces the observed amounts of products.\n*   Let n be the moles of each salt. From our analysis, the total moles of N, H, and O correspond to the decomposition of the entire 7.20g mixture.\n*   Decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Decomposition of ammonium nitrate (at higher temperatures): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   If we have 'n' moles of each salt:\n    *   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n    *   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 0.5n O₂ + 2n H₂O (based on the 2:2:1:4 stoichiometry)\n*   Total products predicted:\n    *   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n    *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.5n\n*   From our data, we have: Moles N₂ = 0.10, Moles H₂O = 0.20, Moles O₂ = 0.025.\n    *   2n = 0.10  => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   4n = 0.20  => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   0.5n = 0.025 => n = 0.05 mol\n*   The value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming our identification of the salts and their reaction pathways.\n\n**6. Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
