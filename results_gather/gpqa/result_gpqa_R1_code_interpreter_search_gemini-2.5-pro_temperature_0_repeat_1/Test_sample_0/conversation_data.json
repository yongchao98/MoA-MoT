    "*   **1. Understand the Core Principle:** The problem revolves around the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a quantum state and its lifetime. The relationship is given by:\n    \n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    \n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth of the state).\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which we can take as the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    \n    For practical calculations, we often use the approximation:\n    \n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **2. Define \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly distinguished or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies must be greater than the combined uncertainty of their energy levels. The total uncertainty is dominated by the state with the larger energy uncertainty (i.e., the shorter lifetime). A common criterion for resolvability is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the sum of the individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).\n    \n    Energy Difference |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n*   **3. Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s.\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    \n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    \n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **4. Determine the Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\n    *   The minimum energy difference required to resolve the two states is approximately the sum of their individual linewidths.\n    *   Minimum Separation ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2\n    *   Minimum Separation ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Minimum Separation ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Minimum Separation ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    \n    The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has a much larger energy width (ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) and is the primary factor limiting the resolution. The required energy difference must be greater than this value.\n\n*   **5. Compare with the Options:**\n    We are looking for an energy difference that is significantly larger than the calculated minimum separation of ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    \n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ >> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the required separation.\n    \n    Only the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<A>>>"
