    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem describes a vector field `f(r)` with the following properties:\n*   It is directed radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this means it is in the direction of the unit vector `r_hat`.\n*   Its magnitude falls off as `1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n*   Therefore, the vector field can be written as: `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`.\n\n**2. The Problem Statement**\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∇.f`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral is:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n\n**3. Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nFirst, let's find the divergence of `f`, denoted as `∇.f`. We use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates:\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂(sinθ * f_θ)/∂θ + (1/(r*sinθ)) * ∂f_φ/∂φ`\n\nIn our case, the components of the field `f` are:\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2` (the radial component)\n*   `f_θ = 0`\n*   `f_φ = 0`\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇.f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis result `∇.f = 0` is valid for all points where `r > 0`. However, at the origin (`r=0`), the field `f(r) = 1/r^2` is infinite, creating a singularity. The standard divergence formula is not applicable at this single point.\n\nIn physics and mathematics, the divergence of the field `r_hat / r^2` is known to be a Dirac delta function located at the origin:\n`∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4π * δ³(r)`\nwhere `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. This function is zero everywhere except at `r=0`, and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 1.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the volume integral:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∫_V (4π * δ³(r)) dV`\nSince the volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin, it contains the point `r=0`.\n`∫_V (4π * δ³(r)) dV = 4π * ∫_V δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\n\n**4. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nA more elegant way to solve this is by using the Divergence Theorem, which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface bounding the volume:\n`∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\n*   **V:** The volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **S:** The surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **f:** The vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`.\n*   **dS:** The differential surface area element. For a sphere, `dS` points radially outward, so `dS = dS * r_hat`. The magnitude `dS` in spherical coordinates is `R^2 * sinθ * dθ * dφ`. Thus, `dS = (R^2 * sinθ * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`.\n\nNow, we calculate the surface integral (the flux):\n`∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nFirst, evaluate the dot product `f . dS` on the surface of the sphere, where `r = R`:\n`f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n`f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] . [(R^2 * sinθ * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\nSince `r_hat . r_hat = 1`:\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sinθ * dθ * dφ) = sinθ * dθ * dφ`\n\nNow, integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `φ` are 0 to `2π`, and for `θ` are 0 to `π`.\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_φ=0 to 2π ∫_θ=0 to π (sinθ * dθ * dφ)`\n`= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sinθ dθ)`\n`= [φ]_0^(2π) * [-cosθ]_0^π`\n`= (2π - 0) * (-cos(π) - (-cos(0)))`\n`= 2π * (-(-1) - (-1))`\n`= 2π * (1 + 1)`\n`= 4π`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods show that the value of the integral is `4π`. The Divergence Theorem is particularly useful here as it avoids the complexity of dealing with the singularity at the origin. The result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as the sphere encloses the origin.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
