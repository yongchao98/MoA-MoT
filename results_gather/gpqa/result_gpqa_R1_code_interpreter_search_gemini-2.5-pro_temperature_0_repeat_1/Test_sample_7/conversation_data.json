As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Analyze the role of each gene based on single-mutant data.\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. This means Gene G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype. Its loss causes a 25% drop in resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. This means Gene G2 is absolutely essential for resistance. Its loss completely abolishes the plant's defense.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. This means Gene G3 also contributes significantly to resistance. Its loss causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n\n### 2. Analyze the gene interactions using double-mutant data.\nThis is where we can determine concepts like epistasis (one gene masking the effect of another) and synergistic interactions.\n\n*   **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants:** Both have 0% resistance.\n    *   The phenotype of the `g2` single mutant is 0% resistance.\n    *   When `g2` is mutated along with `g1` or `g3`, the phenotype is still 0%.\n    *   This is the classic definition of **epistasis**. The `g2` mutation's phenotype (0% resistance) masks the phenotypes of the `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) mutations.\n    *   In a genetic pathway, the \"epistatic\" gene is typically the one that acts upstream. Since the problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the strongest candidate. A transcription factor that turns on the other resistance genes (G1, G3) would, when knocked out, prevent them from functioning, leading to a complete loss of resistance regardless of their status.\n    *   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 and is likely an upstream transcription factor.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   Let's compare this to what we might expect if the genes acted independently. The loss of resistance from `g1` is 25%, and from `g3` is 50%.\n    *   An additive effect would be a total loss of 25% + 50% = 75%, resulting in 25% resistance.\n    *   The observed resistance is 10%, which means a 90% loss. This loss is greater than the sum of the individual losses (90% > 75%).\n    *   This phenomenon is called a **synergistic interaction**. It implies that G1 and G3 work together, perhaps in parallel pathways, and have some overlapping or compensatory function. When both are removed, the system is compromised much more severely than expected. This functional overlap is often described as **gene redundancy**. The genes are not fully redundant (because single mutants have a phenotype), but they are part of a redundant system.\n    *   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show a synergistic interaction, which suggests they have redundant functions.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the given options based on our conclusions.\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a possible mechanism but is a speculation, not a direct conclusion from the data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: **Incorrect.** The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.** (Based on epistasis analysis).\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: **Correct.** (The synergistic interaction is strong evidence for this).\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.** The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: **Incorrect.** G2 is the clear upstream epistatic gene.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We are only measuring one trait (resistance), so this cannot be concluded.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is correct, but the main premise of the option is wrong.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: **Incorrect.** We have no data for this.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOption B contains two strongly supported conclusions from the data: \"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\". Although its third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on a strict definition, Option B provides the most accurate overall description of the genetic interactions among the choices. The other options contain more significant errors or unsubstantiated claims.\n\n<<<B>>>"
