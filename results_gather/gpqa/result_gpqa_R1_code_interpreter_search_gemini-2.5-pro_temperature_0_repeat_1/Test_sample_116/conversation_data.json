    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common sources of chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls, allenes, and spiranes). A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality**: The positions ortho to the linking bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   The steric hindrance caused by these bulky groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is a key requirement for a type of chirality known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   Because of this hindered rotation, the molecule is locked into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation and its mirror image are non-superimposable. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality**: Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four different substituents, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It is a symmetrical ketone.\n    *   **Chirality**: The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Achiral molecules cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality**: The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
