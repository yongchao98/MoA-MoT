The difference is minimal and likely due to rounding in the options. Option C, `0.610 λ / a`, corresponds to the position of the *first* minimum (`j₁₁ / (2π) ≈ 3.8317 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.610`), not the distance between the first two. Option D is approximately twice the value of option C, representing the angular width of the central bright fringe.
