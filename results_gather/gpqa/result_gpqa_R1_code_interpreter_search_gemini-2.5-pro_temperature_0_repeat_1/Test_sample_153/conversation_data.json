    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group. Specifically, 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is definitive for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The 's' indicates it's a singlet (it doesn't couple with neighboring protons), and the integration '1H' confirms it represents one proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   It contains a carboxylic acid group.\n*   It has a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure must be **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. The NMR would show three distinct aromatic protons with a more complex splitting pattern, not two doublets of 2H each. It also lacks a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would lead to a complex multiplet for the four aromatic protons in the NMR spectrum, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **MS:** Formula C₇H₅ClO₂. MW = (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 156. It contains one Cl.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and a para-substituted ring (two doublets in the aromatic region).\n\n<<<D>>>"
