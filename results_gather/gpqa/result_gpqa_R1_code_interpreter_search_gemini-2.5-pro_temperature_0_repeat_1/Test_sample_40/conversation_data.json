    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**\n    We need to consider two different inertial frames of reference:\n    *   **S Frame (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest. The glass block is observed to be moving with a velocity `v`.\n    *   **S' Frame (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame that is moving along with the glass block. In this frame, the glass is stationary.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities in Each Frame**\n    *   **Velocity of the S' frame (the glass) relative to the S frame (the lab):** This is given as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the S' frame (u'):** In the rest frame of the glass, the light propagates through the medium. The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of the light beam as measured within the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The problem states the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass, so we take this velocity as positive.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n    To find the velocity of the light beam as seen by the observer in the laboratory (the S frame), we cannot simply add the velocities (`v + 1/n`) as that would be a Galilean transformation, which is not accurate for speeds approaching the speed of light. We must use the Einstein velocity addition formula:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the S frame (the lab frame). This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the S' frame (the glass's frame).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the S' frame relative to the S frame.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression:\n\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
