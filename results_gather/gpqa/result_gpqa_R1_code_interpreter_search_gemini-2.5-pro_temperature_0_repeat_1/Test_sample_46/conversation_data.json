    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    1.  Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    2.  A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    1.  **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This rules out option D, which is a secondary amine (amide).\n    2.  **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl stretching region. A value of ~1720 cm-1 is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. Amides (options B and D) typically absorb at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1). This strongly suggests the compound is an ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    1.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The four protons on the ring are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n    2.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2CH3). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group. This finding rules out option A (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the ethyl group's CH2 would be attached to a carbonyl and appear at a much lower chemical shift (~2.2-2.5 ppm).\n    3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group, which was also identified from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential chemical exchange.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   This leads to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shows an ethyl ester (-OCH2CH3), not a propionate ester (-OCOCH2CH3).\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. It's an amide (wrong IR), and it's 1,3-disubstituted (wrong NMR aromatic pattern).\n    *   C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. It is a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and is 1,4-disubstituted. All spectral data match this structure perfectly.\n    *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. It's a secondary amide (wrong IR), not a primary amine.\n\n<<<C>>>"
