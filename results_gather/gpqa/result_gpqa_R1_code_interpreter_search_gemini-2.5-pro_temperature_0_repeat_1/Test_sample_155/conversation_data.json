    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n    ```\n          H       CH2CH2CH3\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the alkene is retained in the product. A trans-alkene gives a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either face of the double bond with equal probability, leading to a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n        *   Product of epoxidation: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism, where water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) is equivalent to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *trans*-alkene. A useful mnemonic in stereochemistry is **\"Trans-Anti-Meso\"**. This means that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a meso compound.\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Starting with the (4R,5R)-epoxide and performing an anti-attack by water will lead to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n        *   Starting with the (4S,5S)-epoxide and performing an anti-attack by water will also lead to the (4R,5S)-diol (which is the same as (4S,5R)-diol because it's a meso compound).\n    *   A meso compound is an achiral compound that has stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical.\n    ```\n          CH2CH2CH3   CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\ /\n                    C = C\n                   / \\\n                  H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used: mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺. This is again an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-dihydroxylation on a *cis*-alkene. The relevant mnemonic is **\"Cis-Anti-Racemic\"**. This means that the anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Epoxidation of the cis-alkene gives the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   Anti-attack by water on this meso-epoxide can occur at either carbon (C4 or C5).\n        *   Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) inverts its configuration to S, giving the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (let's say it's S) inverts its configuration to R, giving the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they must be formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 (the meso isomer) is a **diastereomer** of compound 2 and a **diastereomer** of compound 3. (Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol (1) is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3). Thus, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. The enantiomers (2 and 3) will co-elute.\n    *   **Result:** Two peaks will be observed.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   Chiral columns can separate enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the chiral stationary phase, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times.\n    *   Chiral columns can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, a chiral column will be able to separate all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   **Result:** Three peaks will be observed.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n        (Note: The elution order may vary, but three distinct peaks will be resolved).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
