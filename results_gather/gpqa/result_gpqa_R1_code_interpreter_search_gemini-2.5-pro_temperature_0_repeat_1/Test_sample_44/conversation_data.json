    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the energies for the system.\n\n### 1. Understand the System\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they have half-integer spin, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its set of quantum numbers. In this case, the quantum numbers are the principal quantum number `n` (for the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `ms` (spin up, +1/2, or spin down, -1/2).\n*   **Energy Levels:** For a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n### 2. State Occupancy\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold at most two fermions: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### 3. Ground State Energy (E_ground)\nTo find the ground state energy, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level.\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    *   `E_ground = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### 4. First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)\nTo get the first excited state, we need to create the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n    *   One particle in n=2 (Energy = `1 * E_2 = 1 * 4E = 4E`)\n    *   One particle in n=3 (Energy = `1 * E_3 = 1 * 9E = 9E`)\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   `E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### 5. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited)\nThis is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (by moving a particle from n=2 to n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Move one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest empty level, n=3.\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Move one particle from n=2 to the next empty level, n=4.\n        *   Configuration: Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   **Possibility C (Double Excitation):** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: Two in n=1, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\n*   **Comparing the excited state energies:** We have found possible energies of 15E, 18E, 20E, and 22E.\n*   The lowest is 15E (the first excited state).\n*   The next lowest is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
