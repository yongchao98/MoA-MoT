    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State (Dilution)**\n\n*   First, the acetic acid solution is diluted. We need to find the new concentration of acetic acid before the titration begins.\n*   The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2, where M is molarity and V is volume.\n*   Initial Molarity (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V1) = 20.00 cm3\n*   Final Volume (V2) = 20.00 cm3 (acid) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3\n*   Final Molarity (M2) = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M.\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm3 of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles and Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The number of moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) to be titrated is:\n    Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 mol/L * (40.00 / 1000) L = 0.001 mol.\n*   The titration reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COONa + H2O.\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added equal the initial moles of CH3COOH.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach equivalence:\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm3.\n\n**3. Calculate pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-).\n*   This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO-).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where [A-] is the conjugate base and [HA] is the weak acid.\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to the conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid. The ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 + (-0.477)\n    pH ≈ 4.253\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 4.25.\n\n**4. Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid solution plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion (CH3COO-) is:\n    [CH3COO-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH- ions:\n    CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using the relationship Kw = Ka * Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.41 x 10^-10.\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]\n    Let x = [OH-]. Then [CH3COOH] = x and [CH3COO-] = 0.02 - x.\n    5.41 x 10^-10 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 x 10^-10 = x^2 / 0.02\n    x^2 = (5.41 x 10^-10) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10^-11\n    x = [OH-] = √(1.082 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.29 x 10^-6 M.\n*   Now, calculate pOH:\n    pOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.29 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.48\n*   Finally, calculate pH:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option A is the closest match.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Initial conditions\nconc_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nvol_acid_initial = 20.00  # cm3\nvol_water = 20.00 # cm3\nconc_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial solution of acetic acid is diluted with an equal volume of water. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n*   M1 (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n*   V1 (initial volume) = 20.00 cm³\n*   V2 (final volume) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   M2 (final concentration) = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   The ratio of the conjugate base [A⁻] to the weak acid [HA] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.253\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base of the weak acid. This conjugate base will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step a: Find the volume of NaOH needed.**\n    Moles of acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **Step b: Find the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻).**\n    Total volume at equivalence = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Step c: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n*   **Step d: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<A>>>"
