    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Starting Material):** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde.\n    *   Its structure is a benzene ring attached to a propenal chain: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO.\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring (C₆H₅), 2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH-), and 1 in the aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Total carbons in cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 carbons.\n\n*   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr).\n    *   This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻). It contains 1 carbon atom.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The Grignard reagent performs a 1,2-nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. The methyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon, and upon aqueous workup (a standard, implied step), the oxygen is protonated to form a secondary alcohol.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO + CH₃MgBr → [Intermediate] → (workup) → C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃\n\n*   **Product 1:** 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol.\n    *   The carbon skeleton of cinnamaldehyde (9 carbons) has one methyl group (1 carbon) added to it.\n    *   Total carbons in Product 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol), which is a secondary alcohol.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃\n    *   Carbon count: 10.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).\n    *   PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones. It does not affect the carbon-carbon double bond or the phenyl ring.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)CH₃) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃ + PCC → C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃\n\n*   **Product 2:** 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (also known as benzalacetone).\n    *   This reaction is an oxidation, which changes the functional group but does not add or remove any carbon atoms.\n    *   Total carbons in Product 2 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one), which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃\n    *   Carbon count: 10.\n\n*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane.\n    *   This is the IUPAC name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂], also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This reagent acts as a source for transferring a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n*   **Reaction:** With α,β-unsaturated ketones, the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent performs a conjugate addition (1,4-addition or Michael addition). The CH₂ group adds across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   The C₆H₅-CH=CH- part of the molecule reacts with the CH₂ from the ylide to form a phenyl-substituted cyclopropane ring.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The reaction adds one carbon atom (from the CH₂ group) to the skeleton of Product 2.\n    *   Total carbons in Product 3 = 10 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n\n**Summary of Carbon Count:**\n*   Starting material (cinnamaldehyde): 9 carbons\n*   After Step 1 (Grignard addition): 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   After Step 2 (PCC oxidation): 10 carbons (no change)\n*   After Step 3 (Cyclopropanation): 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
