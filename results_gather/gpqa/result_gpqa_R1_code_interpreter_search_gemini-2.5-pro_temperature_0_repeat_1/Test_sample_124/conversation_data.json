    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation is $H\\psi = E\\psi$, where the Hamiltonian $H$ is:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(r) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}) + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\n2.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The Hamiltonian can be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues of a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ are the quantum numbers.\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are ordered by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    This is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of ways to write an integer $n$ as the sum of $k$ non-negative integers is given by the formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$.\n    In our case, $n=3$ and $k=3$ (for $n_x, n_y, n_z$).\n    The degeneracy $g_n$ is:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{n+2}{2} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1) — 1 state.\n    Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy eigenvalue is equal to the degeneracy of that energy level. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3\n    B) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$\n    D) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$\n\n    The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
