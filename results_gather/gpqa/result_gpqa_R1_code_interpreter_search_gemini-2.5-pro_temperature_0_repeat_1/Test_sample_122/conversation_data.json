    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (S') is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time** (`t₀`), as it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   To find the distance `Δx` in the Galaxy frame (S), we need to use the formula `Δx = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (S).\n    *   According to the principle of **time dilation**, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt'`) measured in the moving frame (S').\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   First, combine the formulas: `Δx = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt')`.\n    *   This can be written as: `Δx = (v * Δt') / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   Calculate the term `v * Δt'`:\n        `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This would be the distance in a non-relativistic scenario.\n    *   Calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`.\n    *   Calculate `(v/c)²`:\n        `(0.2)² = 0.04`.\n    *   Calculate `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`:\n        `sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`.\n    *   Now, calculate the final distance `Δx`:\n        `Δx = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`.\n\nTo get a precise value, I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the final equation (v * dt')\ndistance_non_relativistic = v * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor denominator: sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\nlorentz_denominator = math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the final relativistic distance\ndistance_relativistic = distance_non_relativistic / lorentz_denominator\n\nprint(f\"{distance_relativistic:.0f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the ejecta's frame (S').\n    *   The Galaxy's frame (S) is considered the \"stationary\" frame for this problem.\n    *   The ejecta's frame (S') is the \"moving\" frame.\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (S') is `Δt' = 50 s`.

Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (S) is given by the formula `Δx = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval measured in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   According to the principle of **time dilation**, an observer in a stationary frame (S) measures a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the proper time (`Δt'`) measured in a moving frame (S').\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   First, we need to find the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Then, we use that time to find the distance `Δx` in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Combining the formulas: `Δx = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt')`.\n    *   Substituting the Lorentz factor `γ`: `Δx = v * (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt'`.\n    *   This can be rearranged as: `Δx = (v * Δt') / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   The numerator `v * Δt'` is the distance that would be calculated without considering relativistic effects: `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   The denominator involves the Lorentz factor. Let's calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`.\n    *   Now, calculate the term `sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`:\n        `sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`.\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `Δx`:\n        `Δx = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`.\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    *   The Python code executed this calculation: `3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options:\n        A) 2,880,000 km\n        B) 3,060,000 km\n        C) 2,940,000 km\n        D) 3,000,000 km\n    *   The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
