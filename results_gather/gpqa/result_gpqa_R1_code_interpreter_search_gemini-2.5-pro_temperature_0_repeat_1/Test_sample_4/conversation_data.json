    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the given operators.**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the components of the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.**\n    The vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector that lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle from the x-axis.\n    Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This means we can set the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\n    So, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator $P_n$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$.**\n    The operator representing the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, let's write this in matrix form:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation.**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the eigenvalue equation for the eigenvector components.**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides of the equation:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $b = a \\left( \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} \\right)$\n    Now, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b$:\n    $b = a \\left( \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can factor out $a$ and write the unnormalized eigenvector as $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ or, by multiplying by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$, as $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector.**\n    The normalization condition requires that the inner product of the eigenvector with itself is 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    Let the normalized eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a' \\\\ b' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Let's check the norm:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* (\\cos(\\theta/2)) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* (\\sin(\\theta/2))$\n    Since the components are real:\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    The vector is already normalized.\n\n7.  **Final Answer.**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
