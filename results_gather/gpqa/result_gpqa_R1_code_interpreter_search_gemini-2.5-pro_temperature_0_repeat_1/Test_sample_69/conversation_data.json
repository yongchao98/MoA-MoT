    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and answer the question.\n\n**1. Analyze Clue 4: The Solvent Formation**\n\n*   `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Let's consider common 1:1 gas-phase reactions that produce a solvent.\n    *   `SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)` (Sulfuryl chloride, a solvent). This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(g/l)` (Phosgene, a solvent in some applications, liquid below 8°C). This is also a plausible candidate.\n    *   `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) -> C₂H₄Cl₂(l)` (1,2-Dichloroethane, a solvent). Also possible.\n\n**2. Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n\n*   `C (bright red) + H₂O -> A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n*   This is the most chemically descriptive clue. The reaction \"reforms\" the initial solid reactant A, and produces two different acids. This points towards a disproportionation reaction.\n*   Let's assume from Clue 4 that **B = Cl₂**. This is a common gaseous reactant.\n*   If B = Cl₂, then C must be a chloride compound. Its hydrolysis produces HCl, which is a strong acid. So, **F = HCl**.\n*   The reaction is now: `C + H₂O -> A(s) + HCl (strong) + G (weak)`.\n*   For this to work, C must be a chloride of some element (let's call the element X), and the hydrolysis of C must produce the element X (which would be A) and a weak acid of X (which would be G).\n*   Let's test elements that form solids (A) and weak acids (G).\n    *   If A = P₄ (Phosphorus), G = H₃PO₃ (Phosphorous acid).\n    *   If A = S₈ (Sulfur), G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid, from SO₂).\n    *   If A = As (Arsenic), G = H₃AsO₃ (Arsenous acid).\n*   Let's test the sulfur case. If **A = S₈**, then the weak acid **G = H₂SO₃** (formed from SO₂).\n*   The hydrolysis reaction would need to be the disproportionation of a sulfur chloride. Let's check the hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O -> S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n*   Let's check if this fits Clue 3:\n    *   Reactant C is SCl₂.\n    *   Product A is S(s) (elemental sulfur, which is the building block of S₈). So, A is reformed. This fits.\n    *   Product F is HCl (a strong acid). This fits.\n    *   Product G is SO₂ (which forms H₂SO₃, a weak acid, in water). This fits.\n*   This is a perfect match. So we can tentatively identify:\n    *   **A = S₈** (Sulfur)\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride)\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid)\n\n**3. Analyze Clue 1: Formation of C**\n\n*   `A(s) + 8 equivalents of B(g) -> C (bright red)`\n*   With our assignments: `S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) -> C (bright red)`\n*   The reaction to form sulfur dichloride from elemental sulfur is: `S₈ + 8Cl₂ -> 8SCl₂`.\n*   The stoichiometry (1 mole of S₈ reacts with 8 moles of Cl₂) is a perfect match.\n*   Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is described as a cherry-red liquid. This fits the \"bright red product C\" description.\n*   All identifications so far are consistent.\n\n**4. Identify D, H, and E**\n\n*   We have established **A = S₈**, **B = Cl₂**, and **C = SCl₂**.\n*   Let's go back to Clue 4: `D + B -> H`. This becomes `D + Cl₂ -> H`.\n    *   From our initial analysis, D could be SO₂ (making H = SO₂Cl₂) or D could be CO (making H = COCl₂).\n*   Let's use Clue 2 to decide: `C + 2 equivalents of D -> E (extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   **Case 1: D = SO₂**. The reaction is `SCl₂ + 2SO₂ -> E`. This specific reaction is not standard.\n    *   **Case 2: D = CO**. The reaction is `SCl₂ + 2CO -> E`. There is a known reaction: `SCl₂ + CO -> COCl₂ + S`.\n*   The stoichiometry in the known reaction is 1:1, while the clue says 1:2. However, the stoichiometry in Clue 1 (`A + 8B`) was also specific and potentially tricky. It's common in such puzzles for stoichiometry to be a slight distractor. The chemical transformation is key.\n*   Let's assume the reaction produces **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene). Phosgene is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. This fits the description.\n*   This implies **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide).\n*   Now, let's check Clue 4 with these assignments: `D(CO) + B(Cl₂) -> H`. The reaction `CO + Cl₂ -> COCl₂` is a 1:1 reaction that produces phosgene. Phosgene can be used as a solvent. So **H = COCl₂**.\n*   This set of identifications is fully consistent.\n\n**Summary of Identities:**\n*   **A**: S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   **C**: SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   **D**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n*   **E**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n*   **F**: HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   **G**: H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n**5. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\n*   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of **E**, which we have identified as **phosgene (COCl₂)**.\n*   The structure of phosgene is a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. The molecule is planar.\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  A **C₂ axis** of rotation passes through the C=O bond.\n    2.  A **vertical mirror plane (σᵥ)** which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    3.  A second **vertical mirror plane (σᵥ')** that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n*   A molecule with an identity element (E), one C₂ axis, and two perpendicular vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂v** point group.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) D∞h\nB) C₂\nC) D₄h\nD) C₂v\n\nThe correct point group is C₂v.\n\n<<<D>>>"
