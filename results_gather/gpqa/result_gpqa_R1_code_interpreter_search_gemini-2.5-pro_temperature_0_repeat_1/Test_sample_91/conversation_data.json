    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, using the provided thermochemical data (enthalpy of atomization and bond energies).\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule. Let's break down the given condensed formula:\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens\n    *   CH: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen\n    *   CH2: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens\n    *   CH(CH3): 2 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   CH2: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens\n    *   CH: 1 Carbon, 1 Hydrogen\n    *   C(CH3)2: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The notation `C=C` appears twice in the structure (`(CH3)2C=CH-` and `-CH=C(CH3)2`). So, there are **2** C=C double bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We need to count all the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n        *   Bonds connecting the main carbon chain: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. There are 4 C-C single bonds in this chain.\n        *   Bonds connecting the methyl (CH3) groups:\n            *   (CH3)2C-: 2 C-C bonds\n            *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C-C bond\n            *   -C(CH3)2: 2 C-C bonds\n        *   **Total C-C bonds:** 4 (chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 (branches) = **9**.\n\n**3. The Thermochemical Cycle (Hess's Law)**\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be calculated using the following relationship derived from Hess's Law:\nΔH_f (compound) = [Enthalpy to form gaseous atoms from elements] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the Enthalpy to Form Gaseous Atoms**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states (C(s, graphite) and H2(g)) into individual gaseous atoms (C(g) and H(g)).\nThe reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`\n\n*   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy for Hydrogen: We need 22 H atoms, which come from 11 H2 molecules. The energy required is to break 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy to form gaseous atoms:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form individual gaseous atoms.\nThe reaction is: `C12H22(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`\nThis is the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of atomization (ΔH_atomization):** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nNow, we apply the formula from Step 3.\n\n*   ΔH_f = [Enthalpy to form gaseous atoms] - [Enthalpy of atomization of compound]\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Check the Options and Convert Units if Necessary**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\n*   Option D matches our calculated enthalpy of atomization, not formation.\n*   Option A has the correct numerical value (1900) but incorrect units (kJ/g).\n*   Options A and C are given in kJ/g, so we should convert our answer to these units to check for a match.\n\nTo convert from kJ/mol to kJ/g, we need the molar mass of the compound (C12H22).\n*   Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n*   Using approximate integer masses: Molar Mass ≈ (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, perform the conversion:\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_eq_C = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400   # kJ/mol\n\n# Define the counts from the molecular structure\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_H2 = 11\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_eq_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy to form gaseous atoms from elements\nsum_delta_H_f_atoms = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + (num_H2 * bond_energy_H_H)\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound\ndelta_H_atomization = (num_C_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                      (num_C_eq_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_eq_C) + \\\n                      (num_C_H_bonds * bond_energy_C_H)\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\ndelta_H_f_mol = sum_delta_H_f_atoms - delta_H_atomization\n\n# Calculate the molar mass (using integer values)\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\n\n# Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass\n\n# Print the final result to match the options\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {delta_H_f_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization (kJ/mol): {delta_H_atomization}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {round(delta_H_f_gram, 2)}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given compound, we will use Hess's Law. The overall formation reaction from elements in their standard states can be broken down into two conceptual steps:\n1.  Atomization of the elements into gaseous atoms.\n2.  Formation of the compound from these gaseous atoms.\n\nThe formula is:\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of all elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms:\n        *   In the main chain: C=C-C-C-C-C=C. There are 4 C-C single bonds.\n        *   In the branches: (CH3)2C- (2 bonds), -CH(CH3)- (1 bond), -C(CH3)2 (2 bonds). Total = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 bonds.\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)) to gaseous atoms (C(g) and H(g)).\nThe formation reaction involves 12 moles of C and 22 moles of H, which come from 11 moles of H2.\n\n*   Energy to atomize Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize Hydrogen: This is the energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of elements** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.
