    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. When a compound is named with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R, S, E, Z), it refers to a single stereoisomer. If that stereoisomer is chiral, it will be optically active.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n        *   C1 and C2 are sp2 hybridized and part of the double bond, so they cannot be chiral centers.\n        *   The other carbons are in methyl (-CH3) and ethyl (-CH2CH3) groups, none of which are chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond), making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. However, we don't need to draw the full structure.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These indicate the specific absolute configuration at two chiral centers (C-3a and C-7a).\n    *   A compound that is named as a specific enantiomer (e.g., by using R/S notation) is, by definition, a single chiral molecule. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and therefore optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** Succinic acid is butanedioic acid. The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The substituents on C2 (-H, -CH3, -COOH) are the same as on C3. This means the molecule can have a meso form. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. It is characterized by an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration (and its identical mirror image `(2S,3R)`) corresponds to the meso isomer. It has a plane of symmetry when viewed in an eclipsed conformation and a center of inversion in a staggered conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its enantiomer is the `(2S,3S)` isomer.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and therefore optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. Since the two paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and therefore optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation indicates that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** Let's consider the symmetry of the all-cis isomer. This molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the ring. More importantly, it has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** A ketone with a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. The structure is `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We check for any chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and a `-CH2-` group. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations. This plane can contain the `C(ring)-C(=O)-CH2-CH` fragment and bisect the two methyl groups and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   Optically **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Optically Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (meso)\n*   Optically **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   Optically **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Optically Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Optically Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we have 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
