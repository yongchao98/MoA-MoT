    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step quantum transition in a hydrogen atom, from the state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0>. This is a cascade decay. The transitions are specified as \"dipole transitions\".\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers `n`, `l`, and `m`:\n    *   Δl = ±1\n    *   Δm = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted (but energy is typically lost, so n decreases).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transition Path:** The decay happens in two steps. Let the intermediate state be `|n', l', m'>`.\n    *   **Step 1: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n        *   Initial state: `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n        *   Applying Δl = ±1: Since `l=0`, the final `l'` must be 1.\n        *   Applying Δm = 0, ±1: Since `m=0`, the final `m'` can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The problem options suggest the intermediate state has `n'=2`. This is a valid energy-lowering transition.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,1>`, `|2,1,0>`, and `|2,1,-1>`.\n\n    *   **Step 2: |n', l', m'> → |1,0,0>**\n        *   Final state: `n=1, l=0, m=0`.\n        *   Let's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states are allowed.\n        *   Initial state: `|2,1,m'>` (with `m'` = -1, 0, or 1).\n        *   Δl = `l_final - l_initial` = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies Δl = ±1.\n        *   Δm = `m_final - m_initial` = 0 - `m'`. This is -1, 0, or +1 for `m'` = 1, 0, or -1, respectively. This satisfies Δm = 0, ±1.\n        *   So, all three paths proposed in the options (A, B, C/D) are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Determine the Probability:** The question asks for the probability of a specific route. The probability of a cascade `A → B → C` is given by the branching ratio of the first step, `P(A→B)`, multiplied by the probability of the second step, `P(B→C)`.\n    *   **Probability of Step 2:** The intermediate state `|2,1,m'>` (a 2p state) can only decay to the `|1,0,0>` state (1s state) via a dipole transition, as there are no other lower energy states it can reach with Δl=±1. Therefore, the probability of the second step, `P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>)`, is 1 for any of the intermediate states.\n    *   **Probability of Step 1:** The problem thus reduces to finding the branching ratio for the first decay: `|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>`. The total probability of decaying from `|3,0,0>` to the `n=2, l=1` manifold is 1 (assuming this is the only decay channel, which is standard for such problems). We need to find how this probability is distributed among the three possible final states: `|2,1,1>`, `|2,1,0>`, and `|2,1,-1>`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Relative Transition Rates for Step 1:** The probability (or branching ratio) of a transition to a specific final state is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element, `|<f|d|i>|^2`, where `d` is the dipole operator.\n    *   `i` (initial state) = `|3,0,0>`\n    *   `f` (final state) = `|2,1,m'>`\n\n    We can determine the relative rates using three methods:\n\n    *   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state `|3,0,0>` is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. The Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom is also spherically symmetric (rotationally invariant). There is no preferred direction in space. The three final states `|2,1,1>`, `|2,1,0>`, and `|2,1,-1>` are physically equivalent, differing only by their orientation in space (they can be transformed into one another by rotations). Since the initial state and the laws governing the transition have no preferred direction, the probability of ending up in any of these three oriented states must be equal.\n\n    *   **Wigner-Eckart Theorem:** This theorem provides a powerful way to calculate matrix elements in systems with rotational symmetry. The transition rate from `|n,l,m>` to `|n',l',m'>` is proportional to `|<l,k; m,q | l',m'>|^2`, where `k=1` for a dipole transition and `q = m' - m`. The other factor in the theorem, the reduced matrix element, is independent of `m` and `m'`.\n        *   For our transition: `l=0, m=0` and `l'=1`. So `q = m'`.\n        *   The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is `<0,1; 0,m' | 1,m'>`.\n        *   For coupling any angular momentum `j` with `j_1=0`, the coefficient `<0,j; 0,m | j,m>` is always 1.\n        *   Therefore, the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is `1^2 = 1` for all three final states (`m'=-1, 0, 1`).\n        *   This proves that the transition rates are equal.\n\n    *   **Direct Calculation (for verification):** One can explicitly calculate the matrix elements `|<2,1,m'| r |3,0,0>|^2`. The calculation shows that this value is identical for `m'=-1, 0, 1`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Branching Ratio:** Since the transition rates to the three intermediate states are equal, the probabilities must also be equal. Let the rate to each state be `A`.\n    *   Total rate `A_total = A_m'=-1 + A_m'=0 + A_m'=1 = A + A + A = 3A`.\n    *   The probability of taking a specific path, e.g., through `|2,1,0>`, is the branching ratio:\n        `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = A_m'=0 / A_total = A / (3A) = 1/3`.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The probability for each of the three possible routes is 1/3.\n    *   P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) = 1/3\n\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ... and 1/4 (Incorrect)\n    B) ... and 1/4 (Incorrect)\n    C) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3 (Correct)\n    D) ... and 2/3 (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct option is C, which gives a valid route with the correctly calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
