    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n### **2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` = Effective temperature of the star\n*   `R_star` = Radius of the star\n*   `a` = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n*   `A` = Albedo of the planet\n\n### **3. Formulate the Ratio**\n\nWe can set up the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both and will cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n\nThe formula simplifies significantly to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a_1)) * ( (2 * a_2) / R_star))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the inverse square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes. The next step is to find `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n### **4. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (`K_star`), which is the maximum velocity of the star's wobble, is related to the planet's mass and orbit. For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), the formula is:\n`K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` = Mass of the planet\n*   `M_star` = Mass of the star\n*   `G` = Gravitational constant\n\nWe need to solve this for `a`:\n`K_star^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`K_star^2 ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n`a ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (K_star^2 * M_star)`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂/a₁)**\n\nUsing the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_p2^2 * G) / (K_star2^2 * M_star) ] / [ (M_p1^2 * G) / (K_star1^2 * M_star) ]`\n\nThe `G` and `M_star` terms are constant for both planets and cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_star1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\n### **6. Relate K_star to the Observed Doppler Shift (Δλ)**\n\nThe observed Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is related to the radial velocity (`K_star`) by the formula:\n`Δλ / λ_0 = K_star / c`  => `K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\nWhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength.\n\nThe ratio `K_star1 / K_star2` is therefore:\n`K_star1 / K_star2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n### **7. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we can substitute the ratio of the Doppler shifts back into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\nAnd finally, substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `M_p1` = 7 M_earth\n*   `M_p2` = 5 M_earth\n*   `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n*   `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# Planet masses in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7\nM_p2 = 5\n\n# Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to:\n# (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\ntemp_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation yields approximately 0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe value 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Let's write the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio using Given Information:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A_1 = A_2`, which means the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` terms also cancel out.\n    *   The `sqrt(1/2)` terms also cancel.\n    *   This leaves us with:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\n5.  **Connect Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** We need to find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`. The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the star's \"wobble\". The maximum velocity of this wobble (the radial velocity semi-amplitude, `K`) is related to the planet's properties. For a circular orbit (and assuming planet mass `M_p` << star mass `M_star`):\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    Where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Isolate the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Let's rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    `K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n    `K^2 = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n7.  **Find the Ratio `a_2 / a_1`:**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n    *   The constants `G` and `M_star` are the same for both planets and cancel out.\n    *   This simplifies to:\n        `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n        `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n8.  **Connect Radial Velocity (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (`Δλ`) to the velocity (`v`, which is `K` in our case):\n    `Δλ / λ_0 = v / c` => `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n    Where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n9.  **Find the Ratio `K_1 / K_2`:**\n    `K_1 / K_2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)]`\n    *   `c` and `λ_0` (6300 Å) are the same for both measurements and cancel out.\n    *   This gives: `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n10. **Substitute everything back into the Temperature Ratio Equation:**\n    *   We started with: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n    *   We found that: `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n    *   And we found that: `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n    *   Substituting these in:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n    *   Taking the square root gives the final simplified formula:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\n11. **Plug in the values from the problem:**\n    *   `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n    *   `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n    *   `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n    *   `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n12. **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n13. **Compare with the Options:** The calculated value `0.5357` is very close to `0.53`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
