    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem provides a key piece of quantitative information: compound A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote it YFₓ) and has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for the mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + x * Ar(F))\n    Where Ar(F) is the atomic weight of fluorine (~18.998 g/mol) and Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of element Y.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for Ar(Y):\n    Ar(Y) = (x * Ar(F) * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF\n    Ar(Y) = (x * 18.998 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\n    Ar(Y) = (x * 18.998 * 0.6804) / 0.3196\n    Ar(Y) ≈ x * 40.45\n\n    We need to test integer values for x (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic weight for element Y.\n    *   If x = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If x = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but the %F for BrF₂ would be incorrect, and BrF₂ is not a standard stable compound).\n    *   If x = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic weight of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   If x = 4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no stable element fits well).\n\n    The best fit is Y = Antimony (Sb) and A2 = SbF₃. Let's verify the fluorine percentage in SbF₃:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming our identification is likely correct.\n\n2.  **Identify Other Compounds.**\n    *   The problem states that \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Sb) are known.\" The most common are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This means A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony. The most logical candidate is A1 = SbF₅. (Reaction: SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂). The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" does not match the known properties of SbF₅ (a colorless liquid stable at that temperature), but in such problems, chemical identities derived from quantitative data are usually more reliable than descriptive properties which might be simplified or incorrect.\n    *   A1 (SbF₅) \"oxidizes xenon\". This is correct; SbF₅ is a very strong oxidizing agent and a Lewis acid that reacts with xenon fluorides.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Sb) and also interacts with xenon. The reaction Sb + F₂ can produce SbF₃ or SbF₅. Since A3 interacts with xenon, it must be the stronger oxidant and Lewis acid, so A3 = SbF₅.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction for A4 and A5.**\n    The core of the question involves substance A4.\n    \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This translates to the reaction:\n    Sb + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n    The problem implies that A4 is one of the binary fluorides of antimony. The candidates are SbF₃ and SbF₅. We need to find the molecular weight range for A4.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights and Compare with Given Ranges.**\n    Let's calculate the molecular weights of the candidate compounds for A4.\n    *   **M(SbF₃)** = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = **178.754 g/mol**\n    *   **M(SbF₅)** = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = **216.75 g/mol**\n\n    Now let's check the given ranges:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.754 g/mol) falls perfectly within range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.75 g/mol) does not fall into any of the ranges. It is close to range B, but not within it.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the molecular weight calculation, the only candidate that fits perfectly into one of the given ranges is SbF₃. Therefore, A4 is SbF₃.\n    Although the reaction described (Sb + SbF₃ → A5) is chemically unusual, the perfect match of the molecular weight provides the most direct and logical solution path in the context of a multiple-choice question. The other information (e.g., physical properties of A1, the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) might be distracting or simplified for the purpose of the puzzle.\n    Since A4 is SbF₃ and its molecular weight is ~178.8 g/mol, the correct range is 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>"
