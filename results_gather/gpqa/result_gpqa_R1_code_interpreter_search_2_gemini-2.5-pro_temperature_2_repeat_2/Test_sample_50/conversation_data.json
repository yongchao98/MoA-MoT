    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the conducting sphere, due to the induced charges on its surface, are equivalent to the field and potential of a single \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. This allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a sphere with a simpler problem of two point charges.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Image Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the induced charges on the sphere create a potential that perfectly cancels the potential from charge `q` on the surface of the sphere (so V=0 on the surface). This effect can be replicated by an image charge `q'` placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThe properties of the image charge are:\n1.  **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n2.  **Position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located inside the sphere since `d > R`, which means `b = R^2/d < R`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. The work done by an external agent against the electric field of the *induced charges* gives the potential energy of the system.\n\nA simpler way to calculate the potential energy of this configuration is to use the formula:\n`U = (1/2) * Î£ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. So, the total energy is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`\n\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential of the sphere itself, which is 0 because it is grounded.\n*   `V_sphere_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nSo, the energy equation simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`\n\nThe potential `V_sphere_at_q` can be found using the image charge we defined. The potential at `q`'s location due to the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe distance between the external charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is:\n`distance = d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nThe potential at the location `d` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n`V_sphere_at_q = k * q' / (distance)`\n`V_sphere_at_q = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_sphere_at_q = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation\n\nNow, substitute this potential back into the simplified energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system has lower potential energy than when the charge `q` is at infinity (where U=0).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = -kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nD) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur calculated potential energy matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
