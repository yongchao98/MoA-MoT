    "Goldstone's theorem states that whenever a continuous global symmetry is spontaneously broken, a massless (or light, if the symmetry is explicitly broken as well) particle appears in the spectrum of the theory. These particles are called Goldstone bosons or Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Let's analyze each of the given options in this context.\n\n1.  **Phonon:** In a crystal, the continuous translational symmetry of empty space is spontaneously broken by the formation of a periodic lattice. The atoms are fixed at specific locations, breaking the symmetry that would allow for translation by any arbitrary amount. The collective excitations of this lattice are phonons. The acoustic phonons, in particular, are the Goldstone bosons corresponding to this broken translational symmetry. Their dispersion relation goes to zero at zero momentum, which is characteristic of a massless excitation.\n\n2.  **Magnon:** In a ferromagnet, at temperatures below the Curie temperature, the individual magnetic moments (spins) of the atoms align in a specific direction. This choice of a particular direction for magnetization spontaneously breaks the continuous rotational symmetry of the system (in the absence of an external magnetic field, any direction would be equivalent). The Goldstone bosons associated with this broken spin-rotational symmetry are magnons, which are quantized spin waves.\n\n3.  **Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD), for massless up and down quarks, there is an approximate global symmetry called chiral symmetry. This continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum. According to Goldstone's theorem, this breaking should lead to massless bosons. The pions ($\\pi^+, \\pi^-, \\pi^0$) are identified as these particles. Because the up and down quarks are not perfectly massless, the initial chiral symmetry is not exact. This makes the pions not truly massless but very light compared to other hadrons like the proton. They are therefore called \"pseudo-Goldstone bosons\".\n\n4.  **Skyrmion:** A Skyrmion is a fundamentally different kind of object. It is not a Goldstone boson. It is a non-trivial, topologically stable configuration of a field. In the context of nuclear physics, Skyrmions are topological solitons in a field theory of pions (the Skyrme model). They were proposed as a model for baryons (like protons and neutrons). While they exist in a theory that *has* spontaneously broken symmetry (the pions are the Goldstone bosons), the Skyrmion itself is not the Goldstone boson. It is a stable, particle-like lump of the field, whose stability is guaranteed by its topology, not by a symmetry-breaking mechanism in the way Goldstone bosons are.\n\nTherefore, the Skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not a Goldstone (or pseudo-Goldstone) boson resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n<<<C>>>"
