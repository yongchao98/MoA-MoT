    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its Products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C-5 position, which has the (S) configuration. The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** The C=O group at C-3 is reduced to a CH-OH group. The existing chiral center at C-5 is unaffected by this reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (from LAH) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Since these two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one (but not all) of their stereocenters, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds (a pair of diastereomers).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its Products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a diketone with the structure CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This starting material is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, with the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction of the two ketones creates two new chiral centers, at C-2 and C-4. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Let's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S) is a **meso compound**. It has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the CH₂ group at C-3. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (just flip the molecule over).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces the enantiomers as a racemic mixture (1:1 ratio) along with the meso compound.\n*   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Total products:** The combined mixture contains the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II, for a total of **five** different compounds.\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase (Achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point) and can be separated by achiral HPLC.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by achiral HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different polarities and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, so it will be separated, giving another **1 peak**.\n        *   Thus, the products from Reaction II will give a total of **2 peaks**.\n    3.  The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂, with one ether and one alcohol) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂, with two alcohols). Their polarities will be different, so the peaks from Reaction I will not co-elute with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** Adding the peaks from each group gives a total of 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. A chiral column can separate all non-identical stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of **five** distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   An ideal chiral HPLC column will distinguish between all of these different molecules and resolve them.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **5 peaks**, one for each compound.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
