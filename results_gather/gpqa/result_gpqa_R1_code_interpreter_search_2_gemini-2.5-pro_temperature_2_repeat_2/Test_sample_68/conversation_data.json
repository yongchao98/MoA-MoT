    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum track length that a certain fraction of particles will exceed before they decay. This length corresponds to the required resolution of the detector.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nA particle moving at a relativistic speed has a longer lifetime in the laboratory frame (lab frame) than in its own rest frame (proper lifetime). This is due to time dilation.\n\n*   The proper lifetime of particle $X^0$ is $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   The lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau_{lab}$, is given by $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ or more before decaying is given by:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\ge d) = e^{-d / \\lambda_{lab}}$\nwhere $\\lambda_{lab}$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n**2. Interpret the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to \"observe at least 30% of the decays\".\n\n*   **Observing a decay:** A decay can be considered \"observed\" if the particle's track is long enough to be resolved by the detector. This means the track length, $d$, must be greater than or equal to the detector's resolution, $L_{res}$. So, we can observe the decay if $d \\ge L_{res}$.\n*   **At least 30% of the decays:** This means we want the fraction of particles that can be observed to be at least 30%. So, the probability that a particle's track length is greater than or equal to our resolution must be 0.30.\n    $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = 0.30$\n\nCombining these points, we get the equation:\n$e^{-L_{res} / \\lambda_{lab}} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for $L_{res}$:\n$-L_{res} / \\lambda_{lab} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L_{res} = - \\lambda_{lab} \\ln(0.30) = \\lambda_{lab} \\ln(1/0.3)$\n\nThe term \"minimum resolution\" is interpreted as the threshold value for the resolution; any detector with a better (smaller) resolution will also see at least 30% of the decays. Thus, we are looking for the maximum allowable value for the detector resolution $L_{res}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda_{lab}$)**\n\nThe mean decay length in the lab is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.\n$\\lambda_{lab} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\nwhere $v$ is the particle's velocity in the lab.\n\nA more direct formula connects the decay length to the particle's momentum ($p$) and mass ($m_0$):\n$\\lambda_{lab} = \\frac{p \\cdot \\tau_0}{m_0}$\nTo use this, we need the momentum $p$. We can find it from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/c² (so $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV)\n*   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nFirst, find the momentum in energy units (GeV):\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\, (\\text{GeV})^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\nNow, we can calculate $\\lambda_{lab}$ using the formula $\\lambda_{lab} = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot (c\\tau_0)$:\n$\\lambda_{lab} = \\frac{26.78 \\, \\text{GeV}}{3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\cdot (c\\tau_0)$\n$\\lambda_{lab} \\approx 7.854 \\cdot (c\\tau_0)$\n\nCalculate $c\\tau_0$:\n$c\\tau_0 = (2.9979 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}) \\approx 2.398 \\times 10^{-7}$ m\n\nNow, calculate $\\lambda_{lab}$:\n$\\lambda_{lab} = 7.854 \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 1.883 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Resolution**\n\nNow we can find the required resolution, $L_{res}$:\n$L_{res} = \\lambda_{lab} \\cdot (-\\ln(0.30))$\n$L_{res} = (1.883 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\cdot (-(-1.204))$\n$L_{res} \\approx (1.883 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\cdot 1.204$\n$L_{res} \\approx 2.267 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis result ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is not among the options. Let's re-examine the input values and options. It's common in such problems for the given options to be based on slightly different constant values or a subtle re-interpretation.\n\nLet's assume the question text implies $\\tau_0$ is half-life ($t_{1/2}$) rather than the mean lifetime ($\\tau$). If this is the case, the mean lifetime is $\\tau = t_{1/2}/\\ln(2)$.\nIf we perform the calculation with $\\tau_0 = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{-16}}{\\ln(2)}$, the mean lifetime gets larger, leading to an even larger resolution, further away from the options.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the given proper lifetime and check if any option is self-consistent. The only option in the correct order of magnitude is (B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's work backwards from this answer.\nIf $L_{res} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, then $\\lambda_{lab}$ would have to be:\n$\\lambda_{lab} = \\frac{L_{res}}{-\\ln(0.3)} = \\frac{2.08 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.204} \\approx 1.727 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThis implied $\\lambda_{lab}$ is about 8.3% smaller than the one we calculated. This difference could arise from a typo in the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$. If we assume the correct proper lifetime that yields this answer is $\\tau'_0$:\n$\\frac{\\tau'_0}{\\tau_0} = \\frac{1.727 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.883 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 0.917$\n$\\tau'_0 \\approx 0.917 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} s \\approx 7.34 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, it's most probable that either the input data or the options have a slight inconsistency. However, our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is closest to option B.\n\nFor verification, we can run a single Python script to perform the calculation with high precision:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given parameters\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27.0      # Energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41     # Rest mass in GeV/c^2\nc = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate pc in GeV\npc = np.sqrt(E**2 - m0**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (lambda_lab)\n# Formula: lambda_lab = (pc / m0) * c * tau0\nlambda_lab = (pc / m0) * (c * tau0)\n\n# Calculate the resolution L such that P(d >= L) = 0.3\n# Formula: L = -lambda_lab * ln(0.3)\nL_res = -lambda_lab * np.log(0.3)\n\nprint(f\"{L_res:.3e}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n`2.268e-06`\n\nThe precise calculation yields $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nOption (B) is the closest in value and order of magnitude to our calculated result. The discrepancy of about 9% likely points to a typo in the problem statement's given values. Based on the physically correct approach, option (B) is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\n\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame (lab frame) compared to its own rest frame. The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles is a random process. The probability that a particle travels a distance *d* or more before decaying is given by $P(d \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda_{lab}}$, where $\\lambda_{lab}$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n*   **Problem Interpretation:** We need to find a resolution length, let's call it $L_{res}$, such that at least 30% of the particles have a track length greater than or equal to $L_{res}$. This translates to the equation:\n    $P(d \\ge L_{res}) = 0.30$\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda_{lab}} = 0.30$\n\n**2. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda_{lab}$)**\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. It can be calculated using the particle's momentum ($p$), its mass ($m_0$), and its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/c² (which means rest energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV)\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$).**\n    We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = (27 \\, \\text{GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\, \\text{GeV})^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\, (\\text{GeV})^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda_{lab}$).**\n    The formula for the mean decay length is: $\\lambda_{lab} = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot (c\\tau_0)$\n    Let's calculate the term $c\\tau_0$ first:\n    $c\\tau_0 = (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}) \\approx 2.398 \\times 10^{-7}$ m\n    Now, substitute the values into the formula for $\\lambda_{lab}$:\n    $\\lambda_{lab} = \\frac{26.78 \\, \\text{GeV}}{3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\times (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m})$\n    $\\lambda_{lab} \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**3. Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$)**\n\nNow we solve the equation from Step 1 for the resolution, $L_{res}$.\n\n*   $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda_{lab}} = 0.30$\n*   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-L_{res}/\\lambda_{lab} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   Solve for $L_{res}$:\n    $L_{res} = - \\lambda_{lab} \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\times (-(-1.204))$\n    $L_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\times 1.204 \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\n\nOur calculated value for the minimum resolution is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the given options:\n\n*   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n*   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n*   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe calculated result is very close in value and order of magnitude to option (B). The minor difference (about 9%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's provided constants or options. Therefore, option (B) is the intended correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
