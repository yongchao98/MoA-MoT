    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to break down the user's query into key pieces of experimental evidence.\n    *   **Sample:** A chemically synthesized small peptidic compound. Peptides are polymers of amino acids linked by amide bonds. This is a crucial piece of context.\n    *   **Observation 1 (¹H NMR):**\n        *   An alpha-proton signal is duplicated (two peaks).\n        *   Chemical shifts are similar.\n        *   Integrals are roughly equal, summing to one proton (1H).\n        *   The cause is *not* spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):**\n        *   Analysis is at *elevated temperature*.\n        *   Two distinct peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   The intensities of these two peaks are equal.\n        *   Both peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum* (MS), which matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Implications of Each Piece of Evidence:**\n    *   **¹H NMR Duplication:** Seeing two distinct peaks for what should be a single proton means that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since the sample is a single compound that was synthesized, this suggests the compound exists as a mixture of two closely related forms. The fact that their chemical shifts are similar suggests these two forms are structurally very similar. The slow exchange on the NMR timescale (otherwise a single, averaged, broad peak would be seen) means there's a significant energy barrier to interconversion between these two forms at room temperature.\n    *   **LC-MS - Two Peaks:** The LC separates compounds based on their physical/chemical properties (like polarity, size, etc.). Seeing two peaks means there are two separable chemical species in the mixture.\n    *   **LC-MS - Same Mass:** The mass spectrometer measures the mass-to-charge ratio. Two species having the exact same mass means they are *isomers* (they have the same atomic composition, but a different arrangement of atoms).\n    *   **LC-MS - Equal Intensity:** This suggests the two isomeric species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio in the sample.\n    *   **Combined Interpretation:** I have a 1:1 mixture of two isomers that are stable enough to be observed separately by NMR at room temperature and to be separated by LC at an elevated temperature.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. You would see only *one* set of peaks, not two.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) LC system, enantiomers co-elute. You would see only *one* peak.\n        *   To separate enantiomers, you need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral NMR shift reagent or a chiral LC column), which is not mentioned and not standard practice for crude analysis.\n        *   Therefore, this option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data. **This is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They occur in molecules with two or more stereocenters.\n        *   Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Therefore, they *do* have distinct NMR spectra. It is perfectly plausible for one diastereomer's alpha-proton to have a slightly different chemical shift from the other's. This fits the NMR data.\n        *   They *can* be separated by standard (achiral) LC. This fits the two-peak LC data.\n        *   Being isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass. This fits the MS data.\n        *   What could cause this in a peptide? Two main possibilities:\n            1.  **Cis/trans isomerization:** The amide bond (peptide bond) has partial double-bond character, restricting rotation. This leads to *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are diastereomers of each other (assuming at least one chiral amino acid in the peptide). The barrier to rotation is high enough that they can be observed as separate species in NMR and sometimes separated by LC. This is a very common phenomenon, especially for peptide bonds preceding a proline residue.\n            2.  **Epimerization:** During synthesis, the stereochemistry at one of the alpha-carbons could have been scrambled. For example, an L-amino acid could have been partially converted to a D-amino acid. If the peptide contains other L-amino acids, the resulting L...D...L peptide would be a diastereomer of the intended L...L...L peptide.\n        *   This option perfectly explains all the observations. **This is a strong candidate.**\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular formula (e.g., a protecting group is still on, or an amino acid is missing).\n        *   A different molecular formula means a different mass.\n        *   The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the target molecule.\n        *   Therefore, the second species cannot be a precursor. **This is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This term is somewhat ambiguous. It could imply a side reaction where a molecule reacts twice when it should have reacted once.\n        *   If it means a dimer was formed (two peptide chains linked together), the mass would be roughly double the expected mass. This contradicts the MS data.\n        *   If it means some intramolecular rearrangement, it *could* produce an isomer. However, \"diastereomers\" (Option B) is a precise and well-established chemical concept that directly and comprehensively explains all the observations. Cis/trans isomerization and epimerization are well-known phenomena in peptide chemistry that lead to diastereomeric mixtures. This option is vague and less likely to be the primary, most direct explanation. Option B is a more accurate and specific description of the situation. **This is less likely than B.**\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Option B, the presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers, is the only choice that is fully consistent with all pieces of experimental data: two sets of signals in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and identical mass for both species.\n\n<<<B>>>"
