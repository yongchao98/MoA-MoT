    "This problem requires understanding the benzyne mechanism (an elimination-addition reaction) and the effect of isotopic labeling.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\n\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂ in liquid ammonia, NH₃). These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\nThe mechanism has two main steps:\n*   **Elimination:** The strong base removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the leaving group (Br⁻) to form a highly reactive benzyne intermediate, which contains a \"triple bond\" within the benzene ring.\n*   **Addition:** The nucleophile (which is also the amide ion, NH₂⁻, in this case) attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia) to give the final product.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nLet's analyze the starting material: 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene. The bromine atom is at position C1. The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n\n*   At C2, there is a deuterium atom (D).\n*   At C6, there is a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe amide base (NH₂⁻) can abstract an acidic proton/deuteron from either of these ortho positions. This leads to two possible elimination pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The base removes H⁺ from C6.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C6 triggers the elimination of Br⁻ from C1.\n    3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this process and remains in its position. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If you number the triple bond as C1-C6, the deuterium is at position 3 relative to C6).\n\n     \n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The base removes D⁺ from C2. This step is slower than abstracting H⁺ due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond), but it is still a possible pathway.\n    2.  The resulting carbanion at C2 triggers the elimination of Br⁻ from C1.\n    3.  A benzyne intermediate is formed with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom has been removed. The resulting intermediate is the standard, **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n     \n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and non-deuterated benzyne.\n\n**3. Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nNow, the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) will add to each of these intermediates. The resulting carbanion will be protonated by the ammonia solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    This benzyne is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The product has the NH₂ group at C1 and the D atom at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH₃. The product has the NH₂ group at C6 and the D atom at C2. This is equivalent to **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, Pathway A leads to **two** distinct products.\n\n*   **Products from non-deuterated benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    This benzyne is symmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation, the same single product is formed: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   Thus, Pathway B leads to **one** distinct product.\n\n**4. Summary of Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible initial deprotonation sites, we have identified three unique possible organic products:\n1.  2-Deuteroaniline\n2.  3-Deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
