    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Type of Reaction:** This is a Michael addition (or conjugate addition). A nucleophile adds to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Components:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The nucleophile is the enolate formed from 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically bulky base used to form the enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the α,β-unsaturated ester that will be attacked.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens. Therefore, it cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will abstract the only available acidic proton from C6, creating a resonance-stabilized enolate anion. This is the only possible enolate that can form.\n\n     \n\n4.  **The Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon. It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂= carbon).\n    *   This is a 1,4-addition reaction. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the ketone and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Subsequent protonation of the intermediate (typically during workup) yields the final product.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the `(-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group attached to C6 of the original ketone ring.\n    *   To name this product using the IUPAC conventions in the options, the `ethyl propanoate` is treated as the parent chain, and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   The cyclohexyl substituent itself is numbered starting from the point of attachment as C1'. To assign the lowest possible number to the principal functional group (the oxo group), we number around the ring towards it. This makes the carbonyl carbon C2'.\n    *   Following this numbering:\n        *   The propanoate chain is attached to C1' (which was C6 of the ketone).\n        *   There is a **methyl** group on C1'.\n        *   The **oxo** group is at C2' (which was C1 of the ketone).\n        *   There is an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group on C3' (which was C2 of the ketone).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Type of Reaction:** This is also a Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Components:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The carbanion (nitronate ion) formed from 1-nitropropane. The protons on the carbon alpha to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO₂) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base sufficient to deprotonate the α-carbon.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂) to form a nucleophilic carbanion, which is stabilized by resonance with the nitro group.\n\n4.  **The Addition Step:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` attached to the methyl group).\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The product structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂) -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain from C1 (CN group):\n        ```\n             NO₂\n             |\n        ⁶CH₃-⁵CH₂-⁴CH-³CH(CH₃)-²CH₂-¹CN\n        ```\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A **methyl** group at C3.\n        *   A **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The complete IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is correct, B is correct.\n*   D) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
