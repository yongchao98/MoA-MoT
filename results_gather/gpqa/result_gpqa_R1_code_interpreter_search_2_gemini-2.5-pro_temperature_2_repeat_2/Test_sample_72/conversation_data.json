    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe problem asks for the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since both are moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula.\n\nLet:\n*   `v1` = speed of the first astronaut = 0.6c\n*   `v2` = speed of the second astronaut = 0.5c\n\nThe formula for relative velocity `v_rel` is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857 c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γ * m0 * c^2`, where `m0` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts, as measured from a stationary frame of reference.\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n\n*   **Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n    *   Rest mass `m1_0 = 2m`\n    *   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1`:\n        `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n        `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n        `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n        `γ1 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   Calculate the energy `E1`:\n        `E1 = γ1 * m1_0 * c^2`\n        `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n        `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n*   **Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n    *   Rest mass `m2_0 = 3m`\n    *   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2`:\n        `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n        `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n        `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n        `γ2 = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3)`\n    *   Calculate the energy `E2`:\n        `E2 = γ2 * m2_0 * c^2`\n        `E2 = (2 / sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c^2`\n        `E2 = 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2`\n\n*   **Total Energy (E_total):**\n    *   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    *   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 2 * sqrt(3) mc^2`\n    *   `E_total = (2.5 + 2 * sqrt(3)) mc^2`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n`2 * sqrt(3) ≈ 2 * 1.732 = 3.464`\n`E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese results match option A.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\nv1 = 0.6  # in units of c\nv2 = 0.5  # in units of c\n\n# Relativistic velocity subtraction formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2)\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n# v_rel is in units of c\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# Mass of astronaut 1 = 2m\n# Mass of astronaut 2 = 3m\n# Energy is in units of mc^2\n\n# Energy of astronaut 1\n# Lorentz factor gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1^2)\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\n# E1 = gamma1 * m1_0 * c^2 = gamma1 * 2 * (m*c^2)\nenergy1 = gamma1 * 2\n\n# Energy of astronaut 2\n# Lorentz factor gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2^2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\n# E2 = gamma2 * m2_0 * c^2 = gamma2 * 3 * (m*c^2)\nenergy2 = gamma2 * 3\n\n# Total energy\ntotal_energy = energy1 + energy2\n\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E= {total_energy:.2f} mc^2\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to address two separate parts: the relative speed between the astronauts and the total energy of the system in the stationary frame of reference.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Relative Speed (`v_rel`)\n\nThe speeds are relativistic, so we cannot simply subtract them. We must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let `v1` be the speed of the first astronaut (0.6c) and `v2` be the speed of the second astronaut (0.5c). The relative speed `v_rel` of the first astronaut as seen by the second astronaut is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of each astronaut. The total energy `E` of a single particle is given by the formula `E = γ * m0 * c^2`, where `m0` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n**For the first astronaut:**\n*   Rest mass `m1_0 = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Energy `E1 = γ1 * m1_0 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**For the second astronaut:**\n*   Rest mass `m2_0 = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Energy `E2 = γ2 * m2_0 * c^2 = 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n*   `E_total = 5.9641 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\nBoth calculated values match the python code output and correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
