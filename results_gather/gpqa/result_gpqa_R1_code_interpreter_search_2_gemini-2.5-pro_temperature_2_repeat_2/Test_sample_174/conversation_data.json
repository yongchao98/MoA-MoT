    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the radiation source and determine the dominant radiation type.**\n\n*   The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis.\n*   In electromagnetism, radiating systems are analyzed using a multipole expansion (monopole, dipole, quadrupole, etc.).\n*   **Electric Monopole Radiation:** A pulsating spherically symmetric charge (a breathing mode) would be a monopole source. However, due to conservation of charge, electric monopole radiation does not exist.\n*   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** This is the next simplest case. It arises from a time-varying electric dipole moment. An oscillating spheroid where the center of positive charge oscillates with respect to the center of negative charge along the z-axis creates an oscillating electric dipole moment `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt)` along the z-axis. This is the simplest and typically the most dominant form of radiation unless forbidden by symmetry. The problem description perfectly fits a dipole radiator.\n*   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** This arises from a time-varying electric quadrupole moment. It would correspond to, for example, the spheroid oscillating between prolate (cigar-shaped) and oblate (pancake-shaped) forms. Quadrupole radiation is generally much weaker than dipole radiation and only becomes dominant if the dipole radiation is absent.\n\nSince there is no information to suggest that the dipole moment is zero, we assume the radiation is primarily electric dipole radiation, which is the most common and strongest type for such a system.\n\n**2. Determine the angular distribution of radiated power for an electric dipole.**\n\n*   The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` for an oscillating electric dipole along the z-axis is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n**3. Calculate the fraction of maximum power at θ = 30°.**\n\n*   The radiated power `f` is a function of `θ` through the `sin²(θ)` term.\n*   The maximum power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n*   So, `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n*   We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°`.\n    `Power at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)`.\n*   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    `Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\nThis calculation can be confirmed with a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# The angular dependence of dipole radiation power is sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power A is when theta=90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\n# The fraction of A at 30 degrees is sin^2(30).\nfraction = math.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: {fraction}\")\n```\n> 실행 결과\n> The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: 0.25\n\nThe output `0.25` confirms the fraction is `1/4`. This result eliminates options A and C.\n\n**4. Determine the wavelength dependence of the radiated power.**\n\n*   The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the square of the second time derivative of the dipole moment, `p̈`.\n*   If the dipole moment oscillates sinusoidally as `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt)`, then its second derivative is `p̈(t) = -ω²p₀ cos(ωt)`.\n*   The radiated power is proportional to `(p̈)²`, and its time average is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n    `P ∝ ω⁴`.\n*   The relationship between angular frequency `ω`, wavelength `λ`, and the speed of light `c` is `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\n*   Substituting this into the power proportionality:\n    `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n*   Therefore, the function for power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, must have a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n**5. Combine the results.**\n\n*   Fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The possible form of `f` includes a dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3/4, λ^(-6)\nB) 1/4, λ^(-3)\nC) 1/2, λ^(-4)\nD) 1/4, λ^(-4)\n\nOption D matches both of our findings.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem describes the radiation from an oscillating spheroid. The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from such a system is electric dipole radiation, assuming a non-zero oscillating dipole moment along the symmetry axis (z-axis).\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle with respect to the oscillation axis (the z-axis).\n\n*   The power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°`.\n*   Therefore, the maximum radiated power `A` corresponds to `θ = 90°`. We can write `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n*   We need to find the fraction of `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n*   At `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n*   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n*   So, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n*   The fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\nThis result was confirmed by the Python code execution, which yielded a value of approximately 0.25. This narrows down the options to B and D.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nAccording to Larmor's formula and its relativistic generalization for an oscillating charge, the total radiated power `P` is proportional to the square of the acceleration. For a sinusoidal oscillation with angular frequency `ω`, this leads to a power dependence of `P ∝ ω⁴`.\n\n*   The relationship between angular frequency `ω`, frequency `ν`, wavelength `λ`, and the speed of light `c` is:\n    `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`\n*   Substituting this into the power dependence relationship:\n    `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n*   The power radiated per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, will have the same dependence on the wavelength. Therefore, `f` must be proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is essentially dipole radiation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The form of `f` includes a dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
