    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the addition of a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the carbonyl group (C=O) of butan-2-one. This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n    2.  **Recall the mechanism:** Cyanohydrin formation involves two main steps:\n        a.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from NaCN, is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move onto the oxygen atom, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH3-CO-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n        b.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide ion is a base. It needs to be protonated to form the final, neutral cyanohydrin product. This requires a proton source.\n            `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n\n    3.  **Evaluate the options for reagent A:**\n        *   `NaHSO3` (Sodium bisulfite): This reagent typically adds to aldehydes and some ketones to form crystalline bisulfite adducts. It is not used as a proton source for cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   `H3O⁺` (Hydronium ion): This represents an aqueous acidic solution (e.g., from HCl or H2SO4). It is an excellent proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. The reaction is typically carried out in a slightly acidic medium to ensure a supply of protons without completely protonating the cyanide nucleophile (which would turn it into the less nucleophilic HCN). `H3O⁺` correctly represents the required proton source.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source, so `H3O⁺` is the correct choice. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a **nitrile hydrolysis** reaction. The reaction is carried out in the presence of water (H2O).\n\n    2.  **Recall the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis:** The conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a hydrolysis that requires a catalyst and usually heating. It can be performed under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions.\n        a.  **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H2SO4) will hydrolyze it directly to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n        b.  **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH) will first produce a carboxylate salt and ammonia. A subsequent acidification step is needed to protonate the carboxylate to the final carboxylic acid.\n\n    3.  **Evaluate the options for reagent B:**\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong acid. When heated with water and a nitrile, it effectively catalyzes the hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. This is a standard procedure.\n        *   `CH3COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile group to a carboxylic acid under typical reaction conditions.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for reagent B:** Reagent B needs to be a strong catalyst for hydrolysis. `HCl` is the suitable choice.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A should be `H3O⁺`.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B should be `HCl`.\n\n    This combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
