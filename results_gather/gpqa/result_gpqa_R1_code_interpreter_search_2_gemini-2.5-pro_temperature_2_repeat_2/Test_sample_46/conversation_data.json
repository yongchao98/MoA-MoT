    "**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The first step is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency. The formula for DBE is:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    Where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    DBE = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 3 for the double bonds and 1 for the ring) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band in this region.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for an ester group that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The conjugation lowers the frequency from the usual 1735-1750 cm-1. An amide C=O would be at a significantly lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons (likely a -CH3 group) that are split into a triplet (t). According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group must be adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a -CH2- group). This pattern is a classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons (a -CH2- group) split into a quartet (q). This means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a -CH3 group), confirming the other half of the ethyl group. The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates that this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons. This is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of acid or water. This matches the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). They account for a total of 4 protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets (d) of equal integration (2H each) is a classic indication of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, meaning they are deshielded. This happens when they are ortho (adjacent) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), like the ester carbonyl.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield, meaning they are shielded. This happens when they are ortho to a strong electron-donating group (EDG), like the amine group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound contains:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together in the only possible way that fits the 1,4-substitution pattern gives us **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's confirm this matches the choice D.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Would show a complex meta-splitting pattern in the aromatic region and an amide C=O in the IR (~1650 cm-1), which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is a secondary amide (not a primary amine) and has a formyl proton (-CHO) signal (~8 ppm), which is not observed.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionyl group (-CO-CH2CH3) not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group next to the carbonyl at around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly matches all the spectral data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ester, an ethyl group attached to oxygen, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring with an EDG and an EWG.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
