    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A**\n    *   The proton NMR spectrum shows two signals.\n    *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H: A triplet (3 peaks) means the neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). The integration of 6H suggests two equivalent CH3 groups. So, we have two CH3 groups each adjacent to a CH2 group.\n    *   A quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H: A quartet (4 peaks) means the neighboring carbon has 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). The integration of 4H suggests two equivalent CH2 groups. So, we have two CH2 groups each adjacent to a CH3 group.\n    *   Combining these pieces of information (two CH3-CH2- fragments that are equivalent), the only simple alkane structure that fits is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). In n-butane, the two terminal CH3 groups are equivalent, and the two internal CH2 groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. The CH3 protons are split by the adjacent CH2 (2 protons), giving a triplet. The CH2 protons are split by the adjacent CH3 (3 protons), giving a quartet. The proton ratio is 6H:4H. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   Therefore, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B and C**\n    *   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form B. There are two possible products: 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane.\n    *   Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH (a strong base) to form Compound C. This is an E2 elimination reaction (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkene.\n    *   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers (cis and trans).\n    *   If B were 1-bromobutane (CH3CH2CH2CH2Br), elimination would produce only but-1-ene (CH3CH2CH=CH2), which does not have geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B were 2-bromobutane (CH3CHBrCH2CH3), elimination would produce but-2-ene (CH3CH=CHCH3) as the major product (Zaitsev's rule). But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n    *   Therefore, **Compound B must be 2-bromobutane** and **Compound C must be but-2-ene**.\n\n3.  **The Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   The final step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the *cis*-isomer of C and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D.\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. The structure is HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3. For the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene must adopt an *s-cis* conformation.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry of the Product D**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. The stereochemistry of the reactants is preserved in the product. The major product is typically formed via the *endo* transition state.\n    *   **Numbering:** Let's number the diene carbons 1-4 (C1 having the OH group) and the dienophile carbons 5-6. The product is a cyclohexene derivative with a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    *   **Diene Stereochemistry:** Let's analyze the s-cis conformation of (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. The \"outward-pointing\" substituents (which will be cis to each other in the product) are the -OH on C1 and the -H on C4. The \"inward-pointing\" substituents (also cis to each other) are the -H on C1 and the -CH3 on C4. This means that in the cyclohexene product, the **-OH at C1 will be *trans* to the -CH3 at C4**.\n    *   **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** Since we start with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (on C5 and C6) will be ***cis*** to each other in the product.\n    *   **Endo Rule:** The *endo* rule predicts that the substituents of the dienophile (the two -CH3 groups) will be oriented on the same side as the \"inward-pointing\" substituents of the diene (H on C1, -CH3 on C4).\n    *   **Combining Stereochemical Information:**\n        1.  -OH at C1 is *trans* to -CH3 at C4.\n        2.  -CH3 at C5 is *cis* to -CH3 at C6.\n        3.  The pair of {-CH3 at C5, -CH3 at C6} is *cis* to the -CH3 at C4 (from the endo rule).\n    *   From this, we can deduce the relative stereochemistry of all four chiral centers (C1, C4, C5, C6). Let's set the methyl groups at C4, C5, and C6 to be pointing \"down\" (dashed). This means the -OH at C1 must be \"up\" (wedged).\n        *   C1: -OH is up (wedge)\n        *   C4: -CH3 is down (dash)\n        *   C5: -CH3 is down (dash)\n        *   C6: -CH3 is down (dash)\n\n5.  **Assigning R/S Configuration**\n    *   The IUPAC name for the product is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. The -OH group is at C1. The options confirm this structure. We just need to determine the correct stereoisomer.\n    *   Let's assign the R/S configuration for the structure derived above (this represents one of the two enantiomers formed):\n        *   **C1:** The substituents are -OH (wedge), -H (dash), -C2=C, -C6. Priorities: -OH (1), -C2=C (2), -C6 (3), -H (4). H is in the back. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise, so the configuration is **S**.\n        *   **C4:** The substituents are -CH3 (dash), -H (wedge), -C3=C, -C5. Priorities: -C3=C (1), -C5 (2), -CH3 (3), -H (4). The lowest priority group (-H) is wedged (forward). The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise (S). Because H is forward, we reverse the assignment, so the configuration is **R**.\n        *   **C5:** The substituents are -CH3 (dash), -H (wedge), -C4, -C6. Priorities: -C6 (1), -C4 (2), -CH3 (3), -H (4). H is wedged. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise (R). Because H is forward, we reverse the assignment, so the configuration is **S**.\n        *   **C6:** The substituents are -CH3 (dash), -H (wedge), -C1, -C5. Priorities: -C1 (1), -C5 (2), -CH3 (3), -H (4). H is wedged. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise (S). Because H is forward, we reverse the assignment, so the configuration is **R**.\n    *   The resulting absolute configuration for this enantiomer is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The calculated stereochemistry (1S, 4R, 5S, 6R) matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
