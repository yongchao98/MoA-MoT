    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential and Choose Coordinates:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n    Solving the Schrödinger equation is often easiest when the potential is separable. This potential is not easily separable in polar coordinates due to the coupling between r and θ in the `r^2 cos^2(θ)` term. Let's try converting to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to see if it simplifies.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    The standard transformations are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    The first term is `1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`.\n    The second term is `3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`. We can rewrite this as `3/2 k (r cos θ)^2`, which is simply `3/2 k x^2`.\n\n    Now, add the two terms to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n    V(x, y) = [1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)] + [3/2 k x^2]\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n3.  **Identify the Quantum System:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2, is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where V_x(x) = 2kx^2 and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n    This is the potential for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Energy Spectrum:**\n    Because the potential is separable in x and y, the total energy E is the sum of the energies for the motion in the x and y directions:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n\n    We need to find the energy levels for each 1D harmonic oscillator. The energy spectrum for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form `1/2 mω^2 q^2` is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        The potential is V_x(x) = 2kx^2. We match this to the standard form `1/2 m(ω_x)^2 x^2`.\n        1/2 m(ω_x)^2 = 2k\n        (ω_x)^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n        E_{n_x} = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        The potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2. We match this to `1/2 m(ω_y)^2 y^2`.\n        1/2 m(ω_y)^2 = 1/2 k\n        (ω_y)^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy:**\n    Now, sum the energies for the x and y components:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\n    E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
