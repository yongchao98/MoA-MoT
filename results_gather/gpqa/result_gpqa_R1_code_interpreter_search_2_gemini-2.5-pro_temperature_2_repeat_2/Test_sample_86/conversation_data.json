    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Deducing the Chemical Structure**\n\n*   **Carbon Count and Skeleton:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents, accounting for 6 carbon atoms (C6H4). The total carbon count is 8, so the two substituents must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's call this substituent -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The other substituent must therefore contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   **Assembling the Substituents:**\n    *   We need a substituent with 2 carbons and a C=O group. The most common and stable chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n*   **Final Structure:** Combining these pieces, the compound must be a **halo-acetophenone**. The general structure is **X-C6H4-COCH3**. This structure fulfills all the initial conditions:\n    *   It has 8 carbon atoms (6 in the ring + 2 in the acetyl group).\n    *   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   It contains a carbonyl group (in the acetyl substituent).\n    *   It contains an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**2. Predicting the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for halo-acetophenone. There are three possible isomers: ortho, meta, and para. Let's analyze the signals we would expect.\n\n*   **Acetyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and are not adjacent to any other protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl attached to an aromatic ring is around **2.2 - 2.7 ppm**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (on the C6H4 ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Their appearance depends on the substitution pattern:\n    *   **Ortho (1,2-disubstitution) and Meta (1,3-disubstitution):** All four aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent, leading to a complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm), usually consisting of four separate multiplet signals.\n    *   **Para (1,4-disubstitution):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons adjacent to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in a much simpler and highly characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm value) than those next to the halogen.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's compare our predicted spectrum with the given choices. We are looking for a spectrum with a 3H singlet around 2.5 ppm and signals for 4 aromatic protons. The pattern of the aromatic signals will tell us the substitution.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This spectrum corresponds to a compound like 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, which does not have an aromatic-halogen bond, contradicting the problem description.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm). These chemical shifts are incorrect for the proposed structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d)** and **7.6 (2H, d):** This is the classic pattern of two doublets for a para-substituted benzene ring. This matches our prediction for 4-halo-acetophenone.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a 3-proton singlet in the expected region for an acetyl methyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **4-halo-acetophenone**.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals are not in the correct regions for an aromatic ketone, and the integration and splitting patterns are inconsistent with the structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is 4-halo-acetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two doublets in the aromatic region and a 3H singlet for the methyl group. Option C is the only choice that matches this description.\n\n<<<C>>>"
