    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction using the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The reaction starts with Compound X (C11H12O). The reagent, DABCO, is a non-nucleophilic base and acts as a catalyst. The reaction is likely an isomerization or rearrangement, so the product should have the same molecular formula, C11H12O.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation:** For C11H12O, the degree of unsaturation is (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This indicates a combination of rings and double/triple bonds.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `δ 197.7 (1C, s)`: This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone or an aldehyde.\n    *   `δ 21.3 (1C, s)` and `δ 28.4 (1C, s)`: These are two carbons in the aliphatic region, likely from methyl groups.\n    *   The remaining 8 carbons are in the range of `δ 126.9` to `δ 144.1`, which is the typical region for aromatic and alkene (sp2) carbons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `δ 2.28 (3H, s)` and `δ 2.31 (3H, s)`: These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This confirms the presence of two methyl (-CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   `δ 7.08 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.71 (2H, d)`: These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring (a C6H4 group). The pattern is classic for an AA'BB' system.\n    *   `δ 6.75 (1H, d)` and `δ 7.68 (1H, d)`: These are two doublets, each for one proton. These are characteristic of two protons on a double bond (`-CH=CH-`) that are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a carbonyl group (`C=O`), two methyl groups (`-CH3`), a para-disubstituted benzene ring, and a `CH=CH` double bond.\n    2.  The presence of a ketone (`δ 197.7`), an acetyl-like methyl group (`δ 2.31`, C at `δ 28.4`), and a `CH=CH` group suggests an α,β-unsaturated ketone fragment: `-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    3.  The para-disubstituted benzene ring has a methyl group on it (a tolyl group), accounting for the other methyl signal at `δ 2.28` (C at `δ 21.3`).\n    4.  Connecting these pieces gives the structure: `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`. This is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure against the data:\n        *   **Formula:** C11H12O. Correct.\n        *   **1H NMR:** Two Me singlets (`p-Tolyl-CH3` and `CO-CH3`). A `p-disubstituted` pattern (2H + 2H doublets). Two vinylic `CH` doublets. This matches perfectly.\n        *   **13C NMR:** Ketone `C=O` (~198 ppm). Two methyl carbons (~21 and ~28 ppm). Eight sp2 carbons (4 aromatic CH, 2 aromatic Cq, 2 alkene CH). This is consistent with the signal count and chemical shifts provided.\n\nThe product of the reaction is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X**\n\nNow we must determine which of the starting materials (options A-D) would yield this product under the given conditions.\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** High temperature (403 K = 130 °C) and a non-nucleophilic base (DABCO).\n*   **Reactant Type:** All options are substituted oxiranes (epoxides). Options B, C, and D are vinyl epoxides (or allylic epoxides), meaning they have a double bond adjacent to the epoxide ring.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The reaction of a vinyl epoxide with a strong, non-nucleophilic base is a known rearrangement. The base abstracts the most acidic proton, which is the one alpha to (next to) both the double bond and the epoxide ring. This initiates a rearrangement that opens the epoxide and ultimately forms a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound after tautomerization.\n\nLet's apply this mechanism to the options:\n\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** Formula C10H10O. Incorrect molecular formula.\n\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n    *   Structure: `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. Formula: C11H12O. Correct.\n    *   The base (DABCO) will abstract the proton on the carbon between the vinyl group and the epoxide ring.\n    *   Rearrangement and subsequent keto-enol tautomerization lead to the product `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This matches the product we identified from the NMR data.\n\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:**\n    *   Structure: `C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH3)`. Formula: C11H12O. Correct.\n    *   Rearrangement would lead to `C6H5-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH2CH3` (1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one).\n    *   The NMR for this product would show an ethyl group (a quartet and a triplet), not two methyl singlets. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:**\n    *   Structure: `C6H5-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2`. Formula: C11H12O. Correct.\n    *   Rearrangement would lead to `C6H5-CH=C(CH3)-C(=O)-CH3` (3-methyl-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one).\n    *   The NMR for this product would show signals for a monosubstituted benzene ring (a complex multiplet for 5H), not a para-disubstituted ring. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly reactant B, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, undergoes the base-catalyzed rearrangement to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, the product whose structure is consistent with the given 1H and 13C NMR spectra.\n\n<<<B>>>"
