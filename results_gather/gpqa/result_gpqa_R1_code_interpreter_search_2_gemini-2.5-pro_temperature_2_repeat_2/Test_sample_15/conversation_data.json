    "A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule has a double bond, and we can consider the planarity around it. The molecule has no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents). Let's check for a plane of symmetry. A plane containing the atoms of the double bond (Cl, H, C1, C2, C(of CH3), C(of ethyl)) can act as a plane of symmetry if we consider the conformation of the ethyl group. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    This is a complex bridged-ring system. The name itself provides the absolute configuration for several stereocenters: `(3aR,7aS)` and for a double bond `(E)`. The designation of a specific `R` and `S` configuration implies that the molecule has chiral centers and that this specific compound is a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. The structure is asymmetric and lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has a symmetrical structure (the two ends are identical, `HOOC-`). For such molecules, the diastereomer with opposite configurations at the two stereocenters (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall because it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The `(2R,3S)` isomer is a meso compound. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers are enantiomers of each other. Since this is one of the enantiomers and it is not the meso form, it lacks internal symmetry. It is a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    The structure is a six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path to C3), and (4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (path to C5). Since C1 is a stereocenter, the molecule is chiral. The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    This notation refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). Let's visualize this in its stable chair conformation where all three large -OH groups are in equatorial positions. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv) that pass through each C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond. Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, indicating a four-carbon chain with a carbonyl at C1. A methyl group is at C3. A cyclopentyl group is attached at C1. This gives the structure `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The IUPAC name for the `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH` part is `3-methylbutanoic acid`, so the naming is consistent. Let's check this structure for chirality.\n    *   Are there any chiral centers? The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a methyl group (`-CH3`), the end of the chain which is also a methyl group (`C4H3`), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Wait, the structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nIn summary, the compounds that are optically active are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
