    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption with ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength:**\n    The problem states that the absorption occurs at the Lyman-alpha ($\\text{Ly}\\alpha$) wavelength of neutral hydrogen. The rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) of this spectral line is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å), which is in the far-ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Understand Redshift:**\n    Redshift ($z$) describes how much the wavelength of light is stretched as it travels from a distant object to an observer, due to the expansion of the universe. The relationship between the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) and the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) is given by the formula:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}}$\n    This can be rearranged to solve for the redshift:\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} - 1$\n\n3.  **Determine the Observational Constraint:**\n    The problem specifies that the detection is done with \"optical ground-based telescopes.\" This imposes a crucial limitation. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet (UV) radiation, primarily due to absorption by the ozone layer. Ground-based telescopes can only detect light that falls within the \"atmospheric window.\" The shortest wavelength that can effectively penetrate the atmosphere and reach the ground is around 330 to 380 nanometers (nm), or 3300 to 3800 Angstroms. This is known as the atmospheric cutoff.\n\n4.  **Find the Lower Limit:**\n    To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need to find the smallest redshift value ($z_{\\text{min}}$) at which the Lyman-alpha line becomes detectable. This occurs when the redshift is just large enough to shift the 1216 Å line to the shortest possible observable wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,min}}$. So we need to set $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$ to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Redshift:**\n    Let's use a typical value for the atmospheric cutoff, say $\\lambda_{\\text{obs,min}} \\approx 3500$ Å. Now we can calculate the minimum redshift:\n\n    $z_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs,min}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} - 1$\n    $z_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} - 1$\n    $z_{\\text{min}} \\approx 2.88 - 1$\n    $z_{\\text{min}} \\approx 1.88$\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Now we compare our calculated value with the given options:\n    A) 1.9\n    B) 3\n    C) 1.2\n    D) 2.4\n\n    Our calculated value of $z \\approx 1.88$ is extremely close to 1.9. Let's check what observed wavelength corresponds to a redshift of exactly 1.9:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z) = 1216 \\text{ Å} \\times (1 + 1.9) = 1216 \\text{ Å} \\times 2.9 = 3526.4$ Å.\n    This wavelength (352.6 nm) is a very reasonable and standard value for the atmospheric cutoff, confirming that a redshift of 1.9 is the correct lower limit.\n\n    *   A redshift of 1.2 would shift the line to $1216 \\times (1+1.2) = 2675$ Å, which is still in the far-UV and blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   Redshifts of 2.4 and 3 would shift the line to wavelengths of $4134$ Å and $4864$ Å respectively. These are easily observable from the ground, but they are not the *lower limit*.\n\nTherefore, the lowest redshift at which these absorption clouds can be detected is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
