    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of calcium ions:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry**:\n    *   The problem involves the formation of a complex ion, Ca-EDTA, from a calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) and an EDTA ligand (represented as $Y^{4-}$ for simplicity at ideal pH).\n    *   The reaction for the formation of the complex is:\n        $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction ($K_f$) is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n        $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n2.  **Set up the Dissociation Equilibrium**:\n    *   We start with a solution of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, $[CaY]^{2-}$.\n    *   This complex will slightly dissociate back into its constituent ions. The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n        $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    *   Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to this dissociation. At equilibrium, 'x' will be the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ and free $Y^{4-}$.\n\n3.  **Use an ICE Table**:\n    An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table helps visualize the concentration changes.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x         |\n| $Ca^{2+}$        | 0           | +x         | x                |\n| $Y^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                |\n\n4.  **Apply the Equilibrium Constant**:\n    *   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n        $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    *   $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve for x**:\n    *   The formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large, which means the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. Therefore, the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    *   We can make the simplifying assumption that `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n    *   The equation becomes:\n        $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    *   Now, rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n        $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n        $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    *   Take the square root to find x:\n        $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n        $x \\approx \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n        $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   Since 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of calcium ions:\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium**: The problem involves a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex, which is formed from the reaction of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The formation reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n\n    The problem starts with the product, the $[CaY]^{2-}$ complex, at a concentration of 0.02 M. This complex will dissociate slightly back into its constituent ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant ($K_f$)**: The stability of the complex is described by the formation constant, $K_f$, which is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The equilibrium expression for the formation is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table**: To find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms when the complex dissociates.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x         |\n| $Ca^{2+}$        | 0           | +x         | x                |\n| $Y^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                |\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Equation**: Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the $K_f$ expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption**: The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can assume that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate 'x'**: Now, solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value is indeed much smaller than 0.02 M, so our assumption was valid. Comparing this to the options, it matches option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation by solving the full quadratic equation $5 \\times 10^{10}x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0$, the following Python code can be used.\n```python\nimport cmath\n\n# From the equilibrium expression: 5e10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# This rearranges to the quadratic equation: 5e10*x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0\na = 5e10\nb = 1\nc = -0.02\n\n# Use the quadratic formula to solve for x: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndelta = (b**2) - 4*(a*c)\n\n# Find the two possible solutions\n# The concentration must be a positive value, so we take the positive root.\nsolution = (-b + cmath.sqrt(delta))/(2*a)\n\n# The solution will have a small imaginary part due to floating point precision, so we take the real part.\nconcentration = solution.real\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{concentration:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation from the previous step are correct and have been confirmed by the code execution.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium**: We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$. This complex will dissociate to a small extent into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$).\n    The dissociation reaction is: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant**: The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex, which is the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table Setup**: We can track the concentrations as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions at equilibrium. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of $Y^{4-}$ will also be 'x'.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x         |\n| $Ca^{2+}$        | 0           | +x         | x                |\n| $Y^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                |\n\n4.  **Solving for x**: We substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplification**: Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, and 'x' will be very small. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by assuming that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculation**: Now we solve for 'x', which is the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B. The output from the code, `6.32e-07`, confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
