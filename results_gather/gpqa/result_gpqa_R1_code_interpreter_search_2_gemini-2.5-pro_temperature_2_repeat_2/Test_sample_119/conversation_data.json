    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Star Density:** We are given that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere. The unit of `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume (e.g., stars/parsec³).\n\n2.  **Count Stars in a Volume:** Let's consider the number of stars (N) within a certain distance `d` from an observer. The volume of this spherical region is `V = (4/3)πd³`. The total number of stars within this volume is `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Count Stars in a Thin Shell:** To find how the number of stars changes with distance, we consider a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by the thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the density `ρ` multiplied by the shell's volume `dV`.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question asks about parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. For small angles, the relationship is:\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   Therefore, `d = 1/plx`\n\n5.  **Relate Differentials:** We need to express the thickness of the shell (`dd`) in terms of a change in parallax (`d(plx)`). We can do this by differentiating the relationship `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`\n    *   The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars within a range of parallax, we are interested in the magnitude of this change. So, we can write `|dd| = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for the number of stars in the shell (`dN`).\n    *   Original equation: `dN = 4πρd² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = 4πρ(1/plx)² dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = d(plx)/plx²` (using the magnitude): `dN = 4πρ(1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²) `\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:** Combine the terms to find the final expression for `dN`.\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our final equation by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n9.  **Determine the Proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<D>>>"
