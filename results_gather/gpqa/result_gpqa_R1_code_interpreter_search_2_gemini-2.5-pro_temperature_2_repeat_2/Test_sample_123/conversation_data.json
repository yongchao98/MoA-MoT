    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are the exponential decay law and time dilation from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the decay equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` (measured in the lab frame) is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = N(t) / N_0 = exp(-t / T)`\n    where `N_0` is the initial number of particles, `N(t)` is the number of particles at time `t`, and `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles *in the lab frame*.\n\n3.  **Define the terms in the lab frame:**\n    *   The time of flight, `t`, is the time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to the inner wall. The distance is the radius `R = 30 m`. The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`. Therefore, `t = R / c`.\n    *   The mean lifetime in the lab frame, `T`, is dilated due to relativistic effects. It is related to the particle's proper mean lifetime, `τ₀` (the lifetime in its own rest frame), by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n        `T = γ * τ₀`\n\n4.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the expressions for `t` and `T` into the decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the first scenario:** The problem states that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    Plugging these values into our combined equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ₀))`\n\n    The term `(R/c) / τ₀` is a constant for this experimental setup because `R`, `c`, and the proper lifetime `τ₀` of the particle type do not change. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    `K = (R/c) / τ₀`\n    So, `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`.\n\n    We can solve for `K`:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Analyze the second scenario:** The question asks for the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the wall.\n    *   `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n    The equation for this scenario is:\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n    We can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the final answer:** Now substitute the expression for `K` that we found in step 5:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    To get a numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe calculated value `54.189...` is very close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem involves relativistic time dilation and exponential decay of particles. Let's break down the physics and the calculation.\n\n**1. Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a time `t` is given by `f = exp(-t / T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles *in the lab frame*.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime `T` in the lab frame is related to the particle's proper mean lifetime `τ₀` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `T = γ * τ₀`.\n*   **Time of Flight:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R / c`.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equation**\n\nBy substituting the expressions for `t` and `T` into the decay formula, we get:\n\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThe term `(R/c) / τ₀` is a constant for this specific type of particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**3. Using the Initial Conditions**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor is `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles (`f₁ = 1/3`) reach the detector. We can use this to find the constant `K`.\n\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for K, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**4. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor**\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in two-thirds of the particles (`f₂ = 2/3`) reaching the detector. We use the same formula with the value of K we just found.\n\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -K / γ₂`\n`ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, substitute the expression for `K` from step 3:\n\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nUsing the numerical values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
