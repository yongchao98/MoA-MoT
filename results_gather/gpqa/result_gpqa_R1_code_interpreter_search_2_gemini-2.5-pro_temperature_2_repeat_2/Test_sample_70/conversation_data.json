    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between a planet's orbital period and its equilibrium temperature.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius (or semi-major axis, *a*).\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (P) of a planet to its semi-major axis (*a*). The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rearranged to express *a* in terms of P:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n3.  **Connecting Temperature and Period:** Now we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature equation.\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}}$\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{(2/3)*(1/2)}}$\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is $T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$. Using the relationship derived above:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   Period ratio for Planet 2 ($P_2$) = 2\n    *   Period ratio for Planet 4 ($P_4$) = 3.5\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) is\n# given by (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3), where P_2 and P_4 are the orbital periods.\n# From the problem statement, the ratio of periods P_2:P_4 is 2:3.5.\n\nP2_ratio = 2\nP4_ratio = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nperiod_ratio = P2_ratio / P4_ratio\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.8298816281358999\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>",
