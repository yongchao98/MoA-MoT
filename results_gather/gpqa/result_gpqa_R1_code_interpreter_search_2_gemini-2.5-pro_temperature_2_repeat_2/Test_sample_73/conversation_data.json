    "This is a problem about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential probability distribution. A key feature of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already survived.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define Survival and Decay Probability:**\n    *   The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom decays within a time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information:**\n    *   We are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   This allows us to find the survival probability for 100 minutes: `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   From the survival function formula, we have `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question:**\n    *   We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process. The probability of a single atom decaying is constant over any small time interval. This leads to an exponential decay law. A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The past history of the atom doesn't influence its future decay probability.\n\n**2. Formulate the Problem Mathematically**\n\n*   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom decays within time `t`.\n*   Let `S(t)` be the probability that the atom survives (does not decay) for time `t`.\n*   These are related by `P(t) = 1 - S(t)`.\n*   The survival probability follows an exponential law: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n**3. Use the Given Information**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   `P(100) = 0.32`\n*   This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n*   Using the formula for survival probability: `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n**4. Address the Core Question**\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the fact that it has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. The problem is equivalent to asking for the probability that a newly obtained atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\nSo, we need to calculate `P(150)`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Probability**\n\n*   We need to find `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n*   We can relate `S(150)` to `S(100)` without explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ`.\n*   `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Since we know `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`, we can substitute this value:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n*   Now we can calculate `P(150)`:\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**6. Compute the Final Value**\n\nTo get the numerical result, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The survival probability for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# We need to find the decay probability for 150 minutes.\n# P(150) = 1 - S(150)\n# S(150) is related to S(100) by S(150) = S(100)^(150/100)\nsurvival_prob_100 = 0.68\n# Calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes.\ndecay_prob_150 = 1 - (survival_prob_100 ** 1.5)\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(decay_prob_150 * 100)\n```\n<execute_result>\n43.93153579893963\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the probability is approximately `43.93%`.\n\n**7.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random, memoryless process governed by exponential probability. The \"memoryless\" property is crucial here: the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. It does not \"get older\" or \"become more likely to decay.\"\n\n**2. Formulate the Problem Mathematically**\n\n*   Let `S(t)` be the probability that an atom survives for a time `t`. This is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom decays within a time `t`. This is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**3.

Formulate the Question Using the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the fact that it survived the first 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The clock effectively resets. Therefore, the problem is simplified to finding the probability that a *new* atom will decay within 150 minutes. We need to calculate `P(150)`.\n\n**5.

    "This problem is about the probability of radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a \"memoryless\" process.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Understanding Radioactive Decay:** The probability of a single atomic nucleus decaying is described by exponential decay. A key feature of this process is that it is memoryless. This means the probability of the atom decaying in the future does not depend on how long it has already survived. The fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay is irrelevant to what happens next.\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Question:** Because of the memoryless property, the question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a brand-new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Using the Given Data:**\n    *   We know the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% or 0.32.\n    *   Let `P(t)` be the probability of decay within time `t`, and `S(t)` be the probability of survival for time `t`.\n    *   So, `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   This means the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n4.  **The Formula:** The survival probability is given by `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. Therefore, we know that `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the New Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150)`.\n    *   `S(150) = e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   We can relate `S(150)` to `S(100)`:\n        `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Substitute the value we found for `S(100)`:\n        `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating this value: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%.
