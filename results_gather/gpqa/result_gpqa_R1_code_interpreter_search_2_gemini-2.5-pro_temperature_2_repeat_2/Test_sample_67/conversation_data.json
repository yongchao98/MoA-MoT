    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe particle is a spin-1/2 particle. The spin state is described by a vector in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space. We can use the basis of the eigenstates of the spin operator in the z-direction, `Sz`. These are spin-up, `|+z⟩`, and spin-down, `|-z⟩`.\n*   `|+z⟩` corresponds to a spin projection of `+ħ/2` along the z-axis.\n*   `|-z⟩` corresponds to a spin projection of `-ħ/2` along the z-axis.\n\nInitially, a magnetic field `B` is in the `+z` direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μz * B = -γ * Sz * B`.\nThe energy eigenvalues are:\n*   For `|+z⟩`: `E_+ = -γ * (ħ/2) * B`\n*   For `|-z⟩`: `E_- = -γ * (-ħ/2) * B = γ * (ħ/2) * B`\n\nThe problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means the system is in the lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive (as is the case for protons, while for electrons `γ` is negative but the charge is also negative, leading to a similar energy level structure for the spin alignment), the lower energy state is `E_+`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z⟩`.\n\nSo, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n### 2. Identify the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution for `t > 0`, is:\n`H = -μ · B_new = -γ * Sy * B`\nwhere `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time Evolution of the State\nThe state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\nSubstituting the new Hamiltonian `H`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γBSy)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBtSy/ħ) |+z⟩`\n\nThis operator represents a rotation of the spin state around the y-axis. To see how `|+z⟩` evolves, we can express it in terms of the eigenstates of `Sy`, which are `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\nThe `|+z⟩` state can be written as a superposition of `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`:\n`|+z⟩ = (1/√2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) |-y⟩`\n\nThe states `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian `H`:\n*   `H |+y⟩ = -γB * Sy |+y⟩ = -γB * (ħ/2) |+y⟩ = E'_+ |+y⟩`\n*   `H |-y⟩ = -γB * Sy |-y⟩ = -γB * (-ħ/2) |-y⟩ = E'_- |-y⟩`\n\nNow, we can evolve the state in time:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) |-y⟩ ]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(-iE'_+ t/ħ) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) * exp(-iE'_- t/ħ) |-y⟩`\nSubstituting the energy eigenvalues `E'_+ = -γBħ/2` and `E'_- = γBħ/2`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(iγBt/2) |+y⟩ + (1/√2) * exp(-iγBt/2) |-y⟩`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment\nWe need to find the average (or expectation value) of `μz = γ * Sz`, which is `⟨μz(t)⟩ = γ * ⟨Sz(t)⟩`.\nLet's first calculate `⟨Sz(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\nTo do this, we express `|ψ(t)⟩` back in the `{|+z⟩, |-z⟩}` basis.\n*   `|+y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩)`\n*   `|-y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)`\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for `|ψ(t)⟩`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) * [ exp(iγBt/2)(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) + exp(-iγBt/2)(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩) ]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) * [ (exp(iγBt/2) + exp(-iγBt/2))|+z⟩ + i(exp(iγBt/2) - exp(-iγBt/2))|-z⟩ ]`\nUsing Euler's identities (`cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`\n\nNow we can compute `⟨Sz(t)⟩`:\n`⟨Sz(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩`\n`= [cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|] * Sz * [cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩]`\n`= [cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z|] * [cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z⟩]`\n`= (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`⟨Sz(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\nFinally, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`⟨μz(t)⟩ = γ * ⟨Sz(t)⟩ = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression `⟨μz(t)⟩` oscillates as `cos(ωt)`. By comparing this with our result `cos(γBt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n`ω = γ * B`\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`. This matches option B.\n\n---\nAn alternative, more intuitive approach is to consider the precession of the spin vector. According to the classical model (which is consistent with the quantum mechanical expectation value), the torque on a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `τ = μ × B`. This torque causes a change in the spin angular momentum `S` (`τ = dS/dt`). This leads to the equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin: `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`.\nThe initial spin expectation vector is `⟨S(0)⟩` which is aligned along the z-axis. The magnetic field `B` is along the y-axis. The cross product `⟨S⟩ × B` indicates that the spin vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis (the direction of `B`). The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`. The z-component of the spin, `⟨Sz⟩`, will therefore oscillate between its maximum value and its minimum value with this frequency.\n\n<<<B>>>"
