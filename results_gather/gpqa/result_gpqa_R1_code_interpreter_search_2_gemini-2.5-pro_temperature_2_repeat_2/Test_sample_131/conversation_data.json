    "This problem requires analyzing the 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture and deducing its components from a list of possibilities. Let's break down the problem by first predicting the spectrum of each individual compound and then seeing which pair matches the given data.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula Check**\nAll four compounds are isomers with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14. Correct.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14. Correct.\n\n**2. Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number and type of signals.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet (no adjacent protons). This signal integrates to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 methyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. Although adjacent, their equivalence often leads to a single, sharp singlet in the spectrum (an AA' system). This signal integrates to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent (a second signal, 6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 methyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no simple planes of symmetry that make protons or methyl groups equivalent in the way the others do.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl and another proton... wait, between Me at C1 and Me at C5) are in different chemical environments. Protons at C4 and C6 are not equivalent. This will result in two distinct aromatic signals, each a singlet (1H).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. This would lead to four different methyl singlets (3H each).\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 methyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical, similar to durene.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** All four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent, leading to one aromatic singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The ethyl groups exhibit spin-spin coupling. The two CH2 groups are equivalent and will produce a quartet (split by the 3 protons of the methyl group). The two CH3 groups are equivalent and will produce a triplet (split by the 2 protons of the methylene group).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 ethyl quartet (4H), 1 ethyl triplet (6H).\n\n**3. Analyzing the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nThe problem states the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   The presence of only singlets in the alkyl region immediately **rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would show a quartet and a triplet. This eliminates option C.\n*   The aromatic region has two signals. This can happen if we mix two compounds that each contribute one signal. Let's examine this possibility.\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** gives one aromatic singlet (2H).\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** gives one aromatic singlet (2H).\n    *   If we mix these two in a 1:1 ratio, we expect two aromatic singlets. Since both parent signals represent 2H, their integrals in the mixture will be equal, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n*   Now let's check the alkyl region for this proposed mixture (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two different singlets, each for 6 methyl protons.\n    *   In total, the mixture will have three methyl singlets. The ratio of the protons they represent is 12H : 6H : 6H.\n    *   Simplifying this ratio gives **2 : 1 : 1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that explains all the features of the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic signals:** 1 from each compound (2H each) -> 2 signals total, ratio 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl signals:** 1 from 1,2,4,5-TMB (12H) + 2 from 1,2,3,4-TMB (6H each) -> 3 signals total, ratio 12:6:6 = 2:1:1.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
