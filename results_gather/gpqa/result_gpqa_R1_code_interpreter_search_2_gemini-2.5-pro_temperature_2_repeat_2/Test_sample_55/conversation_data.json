    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom's |3,0,0> state (a 3s state) to the |1,0,0> state (the 1s ground state). This is stated to occur via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This implies a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    *   **Initial State:**  `|i> = |n=3, l=0, m=0>`\n    *   **Final State:** `|f> = |n=1, l=0, m=0>`\n    *   **Intermediate State:** `|v> = |n', l', m'>`\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition from a state `|n,l,m>` to `|n',l',m'>`, the selection rules are:\n    *   The parity must change, which means `Δl = l' - l = ±1`.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be `Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1`.\n\n3.  **First Transition: |3,0,0> → |n', l', m'>**\n    *   The initial state has `l=0` and `m=0`.\n    *   Applying `Δl = ±1`, the intermediate state must have `l' = 1` (since `l'` must be non-negative). These are p-states.\n    *   Applying `Δm = 0, ±1`, the intermediate state can have `m' = 0 - 1 = -1`, `m' = 0 + 0 = 0`, or `m' = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   For a decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so `n' < n`. The options provided all suggest the intermediate state has `n'=2`.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2,1,-1>`, `|2,1,0>`, and `|2,1,1>`.\n\n4.  **Second Transition: |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n    *   Let's check if transitions from these intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n    *   The final state has `l_f=0` and `m_f=0`. The intermediate states have `l'=1`.\n    *   `Δl = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1`. This is allowed.\n    *   `Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - m'`. For this to be `0` or `±1`, `m'` can indeed be `0`, `1`, or `-1`.\n    *   So, all three intermediate states can decay to the ground state `|1,0,0>`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In this context, this is the branching ratio for that specific cascade path compared to all other possible cascade paths (which are through the other intermediate `m'` states).\n\n    The probability of the process going through a specific intermediate state `|2,1,m'>` is determined by the transition rate of the first step, `Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>)`.\n\n    The transition rate `Γ(i → f)` is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, summed over all possible polarizations of the emitted photon: `Γ ∝ |<f|x|i>|² + |<f|y|i>|² + |<f|z|i>|²`.\n\n    The crucial physical principle here is **rotational symmetry**. The initial state `|3,0,0>` is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space (the system is isotropic). Therefore, the decay cannot have a preference for populating one `m'` sublevel over another. The probability of transitioning to `|2,1,-1>`, `|2,1,0>`, or `|2,1,1>` must be equal.\n\n    Let `Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = G`. Since the rates are equal for `m'=-1, 0, 1`, the total rate for the transition to the `n=2, l=1` manifold is:\n    `Γ_total = Γ(→|2,1,-1>) + Γ(→|2,1,0>) + Γ(→|2,1,1>) = G + G + G = 3G`.\n\n    The branching ratio (probability) for any single path, for instance, the one through `|2,1,0>`, is:\n    `P(via |2,1,0>) = Γ(→|2,1,0>) / Γ_total = G / (3G) = 1/3`.\n\n    The same logic applies to the other two paths via `m'=-1` and `m'=1`. They also each have a probability of 1/3.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) ... and `1/4`. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) ... and `2/3`. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) ... and `1/4`. Incorrect probability.\n    *   D) `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` and `1/3`. This matches our result. The transition route is valid and the corresponding probability is `1/3`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
