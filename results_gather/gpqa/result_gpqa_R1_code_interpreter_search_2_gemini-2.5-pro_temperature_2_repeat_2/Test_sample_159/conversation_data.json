    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture:** The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where N is infinitely large. A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from its center to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, the apothem becomes equal to the radius of the limiting circle. Therefore, the aperture can be modeled as a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:** Monochromatic light with wavelength `λ` passes through this circular aperture and a diffraction pattern is observed in the far-field region. This is a classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Recall the Formula for Minima in an Airy Pattern:** The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius `a` is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²\n    where:\n    *   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n    *   `k` is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n    *   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n\n    Intensity minima occur when the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`, for `k * a * sin(θ) ≠ 0`. The angular positions of the dark fringes (minima) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    Let `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the non-zero roots of `J₁(x) = 0`.\n    *   The first non-zero root of `J₁(x)` is approximately `x₁ = 3.8317`.\n    *   The second non-zero root of `J₁(x)` is approximately `x₂ = 7.0156`.\n\n    For the first minimum (at angle θ₁):\n    `k * a * sin(θ₁) = x₁`\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) = 3.8317`\n    Using the small angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), we get:\n    `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a`\n\n    For the second minimum (at angle θ₂):\n    `k * a * sin(θ₂) = x₂`\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₂) = 7.0156`\n    Using the small angle approximation:\n    `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.117 * λ / a`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ / a`\n\n    To get a more precise value, we can use a small Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x)\n# The first two positive roots\nz1 = 3.83170597\nz2 = 7.01558667\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance\n# The angle theta_n is given by sin(theta_n) = z_n * lambda / (2 * pi * a)\n# Using small angle approximation: theta_n = z_n * lambda / (2 * pi * a)\n# The angular distance is delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1\n# delta_theta = (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\n\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n\n<execute_result>\n0.507\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation yields approximately `0.507 * λ / a`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    A) 0.610 λ / a\n    B) 0.500 λ / a\n    C) 1.220 λ / a\n    D) 0.506 λ / a\n\n    The calculated value `0.507 λ / a` is closest to option D, `0.506 λ / a`. The slight difference is due to the rounding of the options.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "When an N-sided polygon has an infinitely large number of sides (N -> ∞), it approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem `a` of this polygon becomes the radius of the circle.\n\nThe problem then simplifies to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a monochromatic light of wavelength `λ` passing through a circular aperture of radius `a`. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity distribution for an Airy pattern is given by:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²`\nwhere:\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the central axis.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero, except at `θ = 0`. The positions of the minima are therefore determined by the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nLet `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The angles for the minima `θₙ` satisfy `k * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ`, where `zₙ` are the non-zero roots of `J₁(z) = 0`.\n\nThe first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n*   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nFor the first minimum (n=1), the angle is `θ₁`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) = z₁`\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), we have:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n`θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a`\n\nFor the second minimum (n=2), the angle is `θ₂`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₂) = z₂`\nUsing the small angle approximation:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n`θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.117 * λ / a`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ( 3.1839 / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe python code confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of `0.507 * (λ / a)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) `0.610 * λ / a` (This is the position of the first minimum `θ₁`, not the distance between minima).\nB) `0.500 * λ / a`\nC) `1.220 * λ / a` (This is the full angular width of the central maximum, `2θ₁`).\nD) `0.506 * λ / a`\n\nOur calculated value `0.5067 * λ / a` is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
