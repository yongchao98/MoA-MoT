    "The user wants to calculate the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The main objective is to calculate the mean decay distance, $L$, of the particle X.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant formula:** The mean decay distance of a particle is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\n3.  **Relate lab frame lifetime to proper lifetime:** The mean lifetime measured in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is related to the particle's proper mean lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau$\n    So the formula for the decay distance becomes:\n    $L = \\gamma \\cdot v \\cdot \\tau$\n\n4.  **Calculate the proper mean lifetime ($\\tau$):** The proper mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n5.  **Gather the given values and constants:**\n    -   Production energy of X, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n    -   Mass of X, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$\n    -   Decay width of X, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV} = 0.320 \\text{ GeV}$\n    -   Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = 6.582119569 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n    -   Speed of light, $c = 299792458 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the proper mean lifetime ($\\tau$):**\n    $\\tau = \\frac{6.582119569 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{s}}{0.320 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 2.0569 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ s}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{8}{1.2} = 6.666... = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the product $\\gamma v$:** The quantity $\\gamma v$ can be expressed in terms of the particle's momentum ($p$) and mass ($m_X$).

    "The calculation of the mean decay distance is correct. Let's break down the result and compare it to the options.\n\n### Reasoning and Calculation Verification\n\n1.  **Physics Formula:** The mean decay distance (L) is given by $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$, where:\n    *   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$.\n    *   $\\beta = v/c$, the particle's speed as a fraction of the speed of light.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $\\tau$ is the proper mean lifetime, related to the decay width $\\Gamma$ by $\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$.\n\n2.  **Calculated Value:** Your python script correctly implements this formula. Using the provided values and high-precision physical constants, it computes:\n    $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Comparison with Options\n\nLet's examine the options again:\n*   A) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n*   B) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   C) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   D) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n\nComparing our calculated value, $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, with the options, we see that **Option C is the closest match.**\n\n### Explanation of the Discrepancy\n\nThere are no errors in the script or the physical reasoning. The tiny difference between the calculated value ($4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) and the value in Option C ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) is approximately 0.025%. Such small discrepancies in physics problems are common and usually stem from:\n\n*   **Rounding of Physical Constants:** The source of the question may have used slightly different, rounded values for fundamental constants like the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$) or the speed of light ($c$). For example, using a value of $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3$ MeV·fm instead of a more precise value can introduce such small differences.\n*   **Rounding of Input Values:** The given mass, energy, or width might be rounded values themselves.\n\nGiven the options, it is clear that Option C is the intended correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
