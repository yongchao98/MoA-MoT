    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded group. The significant broadness is typical for the O-H group in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This signal is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak usually appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The presence of both a very broad O-H peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong C=O peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all candidates but doesn't distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the options lies in the complex splitting patterns described. Let's analyze what molecular structure would give rise to these signals. The \"n+1 rule\" will be used, where a proton signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' adjacent equivalent protons. For a proton coupled to multiple non-equivalent groups of protons, the splittings are multiplicative (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Doublet (d):** means coupling to 1 adjacent proton (likely a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means coupling to 2 adjacent protons (likely a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** means coupling to 3 adjacent protons (likely a CH₃ group).\n    Therefore, the proton giving this signal must be a methine proton (CH) that is adjacent to another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   **Doublet (d):** means coupling to 1 adjacent proton (likely a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means coupling to 2 adjacent protons (likely a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** means coupling to another, non-equivalent set of 2 adjacent protons (another CH₂ group).\n    Therefore, the proton giving this signal must be a methine proton (CH) that is adjacent to another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's assume the chemical formulas provided are written to show the linear connectivity of the main carbon chain fragments.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH** → interpreted as `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid).\n    Let's analyze the methine (CH) protons:\n    - `H` on C3 is coupled to H on C2 (1H, doublet), H on C4 (2H, triplet), and H's on its own ethyl group (2H, triplet). This would be a **dtt**. (Match for one signal).\n    - `H` on C2 is coupled to H on C3 (1H, doublet) and H's on its own ethyl group (2H, triplet). This is a **dt**. (No `dtq` signal).\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH** → interpreted as `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid).\n    - `H` on C3 is coupled to H on C2 (1H, doublet), H's on C4 (2H, triplet), and H's of its methyl group (3H, quartet). This is a **dtq**. (Match for one signal).\n    - `H` on C2 is coupled to H on C3 (1H, doublet) and H's of its methyl group (3H, quartet). This is a **dq**. (No `dtt` signal).\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH** → interpreted as `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid).\n    - `H` on C3 is coupled to H on C4 (1H, doublet), H's on C2 (2H, triplet), and H's of its methyl group (3H, quartet). This is a **dtq**. (Match for one signal).\n    - `H` on C4 is coupled to H on C3 (1H, doublet) and H's on the two adjacent methyl groups (~6H, complex). This is not a `dtt`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** → interpreted as `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH` (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid).\n    Let's label the carbons starting from the COOH group:\n    `CH₃(5) - CH(4)(C₂H₅) - CH(3)(C₂H₅) - CH₂(2) - COOH(1)`\n\n    Let's analyze the two methine protons, H-3 and H-4:\n    - **Proton at C3 (H-3):** This `CH` is adjacent to:\n        - The `CH` at C4 (1 proton) → coupling gives a **doublet**.\n        - The `CH₂` at C2 (2 protons) → coupling gives a **triplet**.\n        - The `CH₂` of its own ethyl substituent (2 protons) → coupling gives another **triplet**.\n        So, the signal for H-3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n\n    - **Proton at C4 (H-4):** This `CH` is adjacent to:\n        - The `CH` at C3 (1 proton) → coupling gives a **doublet**.\n        - The `CH₃` at C5 (3 protons) → coupling gives a **quartet**.\n        - The `CH₂` of its own ethyl substituent (2 protons) → coupling gives a **triplet**.\n        So, the signal for H-4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal described.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D, which corresponds to 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only candidate that contains a proton whose signal would be a `dtt` and another proton whose signal would be a `dtq`. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
