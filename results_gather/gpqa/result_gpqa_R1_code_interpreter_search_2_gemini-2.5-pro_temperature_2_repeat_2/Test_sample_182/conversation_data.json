    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its IHD\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\nTo find the IHD, we can identify all the structural features that contribute to it. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is a count of how many pairs of hydrogen atoms a molecule is \"missing\" compared to the corresponding saturated acyclic alkane. Each of the following features contributes 1 to the IHD:\n*   One ring\n*   One double bond (C=C, C=O, etc.)\n*   Two triple bonds are equivalent to two double bonds, so one triple bond contributes 2 to the IHD.\n\nLet's break down the structure of the reactant:\n1.  **cyclohex-**: There is a six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n2.  **-3-ene**: There is a carbon-carbon double bond within the ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n3.  **carboxylic acid**: The -COOH group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n4.  **2-formyl**: The formyl group (-CHO) is an aldehyde, which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n5.  **5-vinyl**: The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\nSumming up these contributions, the total IHD of the reactant molecule is:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI)**. This is a very strong reducing agent combination known for the complete reduction of a wide variety of functional groups down to the corresponding alkane.\n\nThe effects of this reagent on the functional groups present in our reactant are:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Alkene (C=C)** is reduced to an alkane (C-C) by addition of H₂ across the double bond.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product and its IHD\n\nThe reaction will cause the following changes to the structural features that contribute to the IHD:\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated (reduced to a C-C single bond). The IHD contribution of 1 is eliminated.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is saturated. The vinyl group becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃). The IHD contribution of 1 is eliminated.\n*   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is removed during reduction to a methyl group. The IHD contribution of 1 is eliminated.\n*   The C=O double bond in the formyl group is removed during reduction to a methyl group. The IHD contribution of 1 is eliminated.\n\nThe only IHD-contributing feature that remains after the reaction is the **cyclohexane ring**. A ring is a cyclic structure, and its formation requires the removal of two hydrogen atoms compared to its open-chain counterpart, hence it always contributes **1** to the IHD. The cyclohexane ring is very stable and will not be opened by this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is solely due to the presence of the ring.\n\nIHD_product = IHD_reactant - (IHD from reduced bonds)\nIHD_product = 5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can directly identify the remaining unsaturation in the product. The product is an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated cycloalkane, meaning it has no double or triple bonds. The only feature contributing to the IHD is the ring itself.\nIHD_product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for any double/triple bonds) = **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. This corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the final saturated hydrocarbon molecule.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
