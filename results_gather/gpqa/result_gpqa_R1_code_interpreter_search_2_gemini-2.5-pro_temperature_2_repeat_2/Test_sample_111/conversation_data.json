    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Normalize the state vector |α>**\n\nThe given unnormalized state is `|α'> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nIn vector notation, this can be written as:\n`|α'> = [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to divide it by the square root of its inner product with itself, `sqrt(<α'|α'>)`.\nThe inner product `<α'|α'>` is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components:\n`<α'|α'> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2`\n`|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2`\n`|2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5`\n`<α'|α'> = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant `N` is `1 / sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state `|α>` is:\n`|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>] = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n### **2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues**\n\nThe problem describes the matrix `A` with elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this matrix is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix `σ_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ = ± hbar/2`\n\nSo, the two eigenvalues are `a_1 = +hbar/2` and `a_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For eigenvalue `a_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] [[v1], [v2]] = +hbar/2 * [[v1], [v2]]`\n    This gives `v2 = v1`. The normalized eigenvector is `|a_1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For eigenvalue `a_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] [[v1], [v2]] = -hbar/2 * [[v1], [v2]]`\n    This gives `v2 = -v1`. The normalized eigenvector is `|a_2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in a specific eigenstate is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state vector `|α>` onto that eigenstate.\n\nProbability `P_1` of measuring `a_1 = +hbar/2`:\n`P_1 = |<a_1|α>|^2`\n`<a_1| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`\n`<a_1|α> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`<a_1|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * ( (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (3)`\n`P_1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.643`\n\nProbability `P_2` of measuring `a_2 = -hbar/2`:\n`P_2 = |<a_2|α>|^2`\n`<a_2| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`\n`<a_2|α> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`<a_2|α> = (1/sqrt(14)) * ( (1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i) ) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n`P_2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = 5 / 14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n### **4. Calculate the average value of the operator A**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` is given by `<α|A|α>`.\n`<A> = <α| A |α>`\nWe have `<α| = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i]` and `|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`.\n`A|α> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`A|α> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n\n`<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * 2 = hbar / 7`\n\nAlternatively, using the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n`<A> = P_1 * a_1 + P_2 * a_2`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar / 7`\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
