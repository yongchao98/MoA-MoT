    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X.\n\n**1. Understand the Interaction and Decay Process**\n\nThe provided Lagrangian density for the interaction between the bosonic field X and a fermion field $\\psi_f$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) \\psi_f $$\nExpanding this expression gives two terms:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f v \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\nThe first term represents the mass of the fermion, $m_f = \\lambda_f v$. The second term, $-\\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, describes the interaction vertex where the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This interaction allows the boson X to decay into a fermion and its corresponding antifermion, a process denoted as:\n$$ X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f} $$\n\n**2. Kinematic Condition for Decay**\n\nFor a decay to be \"kinematically allowed,\" the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final state particles. In this case:\n$$ m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ m_X \\ge 2m_f $$\n\n**3. Apply the Given Masses**\n\nWe are given the mass of the boson X:\n$$ m_X = 6 \\text{ GeV} $$\nSubstituting this value into our kinematic condition, we get:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2m_f $$\nDividing by 2, we find the condition on the mass of the fermion $f$:\n$$ m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nSo, the boson X can only decay into pairs of fermions whose individual mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Check Fermion Masses**\n\nNow, we must check the masses of the Standard Model fermions (quarks and leptons) to see which ones satisfy this condition.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   **Up quark (u):** $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV/c}^2 = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $0.0022 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Down quark (d):** $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV/c}^2 = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $0.0047 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Strange quark (s):** $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV/c}^2 = 0.095 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $0.095 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Charm quark (c):** $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $1.27 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Bottom quark (b):** $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not allowed**.\n*   **Top quark (t):** $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not allowed**.\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   **Electron (e):** $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV/c}^2 = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $0.000511 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$):** $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV/c}^2 = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $0.1057 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$):** $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$. Since $1.777 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n*(Note: Neutrino masses are extremely small and well below the 3 GeV threshold, so decays to neutrinos are also kinematically allowed, but they are not included in the options provided).*\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nBased on our analysis, the complete list of kinematically allowed decay channels (among quarks and charged leptons) is:\n$$ X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}, e^{+}e^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-} $$\nNow, let's examine the given choices:\n\n*   **A) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This list exactly matches our derived set of allowed decays.\n\n*   **B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This is incorrect because it includes the decay to a top-antitop pair ($t\\bar{t}$), which is forbidden as $m_t > 3$ GeV.\n\n*   **C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This is incorrect because it includes the decay to a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$), which is forbidden as $m_b > 3$ GeV. It also omits the allowed decay to a muon-antimuon pair ($\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$).\n\n*   **D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$**\n    This is incorrect because it includes the decay to a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$), which is forbidden.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly lists all the kinematically allowed decays is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
