    "The user wants me to arrange six monosubstituted benzene compounds in order of the increasing yield of the para-isomer upon electrophilic bromination.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction and Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The position of the incoming bromine atom (ortho, meta, or para) is determined by the substituent already on the benzene ring (C₆H₅-X). We need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-directing groups:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   -CH₃ (Methyl): Activating group.\n    *   -C₂H₅ (Ethyl): Activating group.\n    *   -Cl (Chloro): Deactivating group (halogen).\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. They produce very small amounts of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   -NO₂ (Nitro): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl carboxylate): Deactivating.\n    *   -COOH (Carboxylic acid): Deactivating.\n\n**2. Analyze Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6) will produce primarily the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low. For our ranking, these three will have the lowest para-isomer yields. We can consider their para-yields to be effectively negligible and close to 0%. Therefore, the order among them doesn't significantly alter their position at the bottom of the list. We will group them together as having the lowest yields: {4, 2, 6}.\n\n**3. Analyze Ortho/Para-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with ortho/para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is heavily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\nLet's compare the steric bulk of these groups:\n*   **-Cl (Chloro):** Chlorine is a single atom. It offers the least steric hindrance among these three.\n*   **-CH₃ (Methyl):** A methyl group is larger than a single chlorine atom. It will create more steric hindrance at the ortho positions.\n*   **-C₂H₅ (Ethyl):** An ethyl group is larger and bulkier than a methyl group. It will cause the most steric hindrance.\n\nThe trend for increasing steric hindrance is: **-Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅**.\n\nConsequently, the preference for para-substitution (and thus the yield of the para-isomer) will follow the same trend:\n**Yield(para-Cl) < Yield(para-CH₃) < Yield(para-C₂H₅)**\n\nThis means the order of substances 1, 3, and 5 in terms of increasing para-isomer yield is **3 < 1 < 5**.\n\n**4. Combine the Rankings**\n\nWe have established two groups:\n*   **Lowest para-yield:** {4, 2, 6} (meta-directors)\n*   **Highest para-yield:** 3 < 1 < 5 (ortho/para-directors, ordered by steric hindrance)\n\nCombining these, the overall order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n{4, 2, 6} < 3 < 1 < 5\n\nNow, let's examine the options provided. Option C matches our derived order:\nC) 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5\n\nThis option correctly places all meta-directors before all ortho/para-directors and correctly orders the ortho/para-directors based on steric hindrance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
