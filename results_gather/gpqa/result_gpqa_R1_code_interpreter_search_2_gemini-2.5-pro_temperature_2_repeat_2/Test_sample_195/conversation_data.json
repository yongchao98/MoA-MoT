    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves a conservative force (from the spring) and relativistic speeds. The governing principle is the conservation of total relativistic energy.\n\n2.  **Define the total relativistic energy:** For a particle of rest mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ in a potential field $U(x)$, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy. The relativistic energy of the particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $mc^2$ is the rest energy.\n    Therefore, the conserved total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n\n3.  **Define the potential energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ stored in the spring is the integral of the force:\n    $U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy principle to two key points in the oscillation:**\n    *   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude ($x=A$)**\n        The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity $v = 0$.\n        This means the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total,1} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position ($x=0$)**\n        The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$.\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total,2} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$.\n\n5.  **Equate the total energy at the two points:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, $E_{total,1} = E_{total,2}$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    *   First, isolate the term with the Lorentz factor. Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$\n\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides to get the square root term in the numerator:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}$\n\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $\\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} \\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n        $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ exactly matches option (C).\n\n    *   Option A) is the non-relativistic limit.\n    *   Option B) would imply $v_{max} > c$, which is physically impossible.\n    *   Option D) is dimensionally inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
