    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a compound containing a single **chlorine** atom (due to the natural abundance of isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope), and it contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl absorption corresponds to the C=O of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, a region characteristic for the highly deshielded proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and it's a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm indicate the presence of an **aromatic ring** (like benzene).\n*   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets, 2H each):** We see two signals in the aromatic region: a doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2 protons, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm also integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern (two groups of two equivalent protons each splitting each other) is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. A mono-, ortho-, or meta-substituted ring would produce more complex or different splitting patterns.\n\n**Putting It All Together and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   We have a **carboxylic acid**.\n*   It contains a single **chlorine atom**.\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement**.\n\nLet's check the proposed structures:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has the correct MW (156) and a Cl atom, but it's an acid chloroformate, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H IR peak and the carboxylic acid proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Has the correct MW and a Cl atom. However, it is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would show an aldehyde proton (~10 ppm) and a complex pattern for three aromatic protons, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 4 (*para*).\n    *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of ~156 g/mol and contains one Cl atom. Matches.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. Matches.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton and a *para*-substituted ring, which would give the observed two-doublet pattern for the four aromatic protons. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded (8.02 ppm), and the protons closer to the chlorine atom would be less so (7.72 ppm). Matches perfectly.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Has the correct MW and is a carboxylic acid. However, this is an *ortho*-substituted ring. This would result in four non-equivalent aromatic protons and a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, which contradicts the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point conclusively to the structure being 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\n# Molecular formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2.\n# Calculate the mass of the molecular ions with 35Cl and 37Cl isotopes.\n# Atomic masses: C ≈ 12.01, H ≈ 1.008, O ≈ 16.00, 35Cl ≈ 34.97, 37Cl ≈ 36.97\nmass_35Cl = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.008) + (1 * 34.97) + (2 * 16.00)\nmass_37Cl = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.008) + (1 * 36.97) + (2 * 16.00)\n\nprint(f\"Molecular ion peak (M+) with 35Cl: {mass_35Cl:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Isotope peak (M+2) with 37Cl: {mass_37Cl:.2f}\")\n\n```\nThe python code calculates the expected molecular ion masses for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, confirming that the molecule has masses of 156.08 and 158.08, which correspond to the peaks observed at m/z = 156 and m/z = 158 in the mass spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Mass Spectrometry (MS): The molecular ion peak is at m/z = 156. The presence of a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with about one-third the intensity (32%) of the M+ peak (100%) is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing one chlorine atom.\n\nInfrared (IR) Spectroscopy: The very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is classic for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n¹H NMR Spectroscopy: The singlet at 11.0 ppm is a highly deshielded proton, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2H, indicate a symmetrically substituted benzene ring. Specifically, a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring would give this pattern, where the two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are equivalent.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an acyl chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would not show the broad O-H IR band or the carboxylic acid proton in the NMR.\nB) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde with a phenol group. While it has an OH group, the IR and NMR would be different. The aromatic region in the NMR would be much more complex, with three distinct protons.\nC) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This molecule has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the MS data. It is a carboxylic acid, which fits the IR data perfectly. The 1,4-(para) substitution pattern of the chlorine and the carboxylic acid on the benzene ring would produce the symmetrical two-doublet pattern observed in the ¹H NMR. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid would be further downfield (8.02 ppm), and the protons adjacent to the chlorine would be slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). This structure perfectly matches all provided data.\nD) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This molecule is a carboxylic acid, but the 1,2-(ortho) substitution would result in four distinct protons on the aromatic ring, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that is consistent with all the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
