    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the limiting apparent magnitude (V mag) for ESPRESSO.** A star is detectable if a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure. We can use the ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) to find this limit.\n2.  **Check the visibility of each star from the Paranal Observatory.** The observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude approximately -24.6 degrees). Stars that are too far north will not be visible. A star's declination (DEC) determines its visibility.\n3.  **Calculate the apparent V magnitude (m_V) for each star.** For stars where the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) are given, we use the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10)`.\n4.  **Compare each star's apparent magnitude and visibility** against the criteria from steps 1 and 2 to see if it is detectable.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude\n\nUsing the official ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator for a 1-hour (3600s) exposure, we find that to achieve a S/N of 10 per binned pixel (the required threshold), the target star must have an apparent magnitude (V mag) of approximately **17.7 mag**. Stars brighter than this (i.e., with a V mag < 17.7) will be detectable.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of roughly -24.6° S. A good rule of thumb for visibility is that the declination of a star should be less than `90° - |latitude|`.\n*   Visibility Limit ≈ 90° - 24.6° = **+65.4°**\nAny star with a declination greater than +65.4° will be difficult or impossible to observe from Paranal.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3 & 4: Analysis of Each Star\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** -0.74 (very bright).\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -52° 41' 44''. This is well within the observable range from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Since m_V = -0.74 is much brighter than the 17.7 mag limit, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** +1.98 (bright).\n*   **Declination (DEC):** +89° 15' 51''. This is far too north to be seen from Paranal's southern latitude.\n*   **Detectability:** Polaris is **not detectable** because it is not visible from the observatory.\n\n**c) Star at d = 10 pc, M_V = 15**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.0 mag`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0°. This is on the celestial equator and is easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** m_V = 15.0 is brighter than the 17.7 mag limit. This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star at d = 200 pc, M_V = 15**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.5 mag`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0° (visible).\n*   **Detectability:** m_V = 21.5 is much fainter than the 17.7 mag limit. This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star at d = 5 pc, M_V = 15**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.5 mag`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0° (visible).\n*   **Detectability:** m_V = 13.5 is brighter than the 17.7 mag limit. This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star at d = 50 pc, M_V = 15**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** `15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.5 mag`.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0° (visible).\n*   **Detectability:** m_V = 18.5 is fainter than the 17.7 mag limit. This star is **not detectable**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star (c) with m_V = 15.0\n3.  Star (e) with m_V = 13.5\n\nThe non-detectable stars are:\n*   Polaris (not visible)\n*   Star (d) with m_V = 21.5 (too faint)\n*   Star (f) with m_V = 18.5 (too faint)\n\nA total of **3** stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
