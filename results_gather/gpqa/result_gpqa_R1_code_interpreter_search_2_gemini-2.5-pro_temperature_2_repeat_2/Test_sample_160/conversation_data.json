    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have a fixed volume (the sample compartment) with a certain number density (n) of gas molecules. The temperature is constant.\n    *   **λ1**: This is the mean free path of a *gas molecule* moving through the other gas molecules. It's the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule.\n    *   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of an *electron* from the high-energy beam moving through the same gas molecules. It's the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n    *   The question asks for the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics of Mean Free Path (λ):**\n    The mean free path is described by the formula:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n    However, this simple formula assumes the target particles are stationary. In reality, we need to consider two different scenarios.\n\n3.  **Calculate λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   In a gas, all molecules are moving randomly. The projectile is a molecule, and the targets are also molecules, and they are all in motion.\n    *   Standard kinetic theory of gases accounts for this relative motion. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2 (√2 ≈ 1.414) into the denominator.\n    *   The collision cross-section (σ_gg) for two identical spherical molecules with diameter `d` is πd².\n    *   So, the formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule is:\n        **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)**\n\n4.  **Calculate λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   Here, the projectile is a very high-energy electron (1000 kV), and the targets are the gas molecules.\n    *   Because the electron is moving so much faster than the gas molecules, we can treat the gas molecules as essentially stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 factor from relative motion is not used.\n    *   Now, let's consider the cross-section (σ_eg). The electron is practically a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule). The gas molecule has a diameter `d` (and radius r = d/2). The collision cross-section is the area of the target molecule.\n    *   σ_eg = π * r² = π * (d/2)² = (1/4) * π * d²\n    *   So, the formula for the mean free path of the electron is:\n        **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (1/4) * π * d²) = 4 / (n * π * d²)**\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    Now we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]\n    λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\n    So, **λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1**.\n\n    *Even if we use a simplified model where we ignore the size difference and assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg, the difference in relative motion would still exist.* In that case:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ) ] = √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    So, **λ2 ≈ 1.41 * λ1**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1  (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1 (Incorrect, as both our calculations show λ2 is at least 1.41 times λ1)\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1 (Correct, as our realistic calculation gives λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1 and our simplified one gives λ2 ≈ 1.41 * λ1. Both values are greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ1.)\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n\n    Both physically intuitive reasoning (a tiny electron is less likely to hit a molecule than another molecule is) and quantitative analysis show that the electron's mean free path (λ2) is significantly longer than the molecule's mean free path (λ1).\n\n<<<C>>>"
