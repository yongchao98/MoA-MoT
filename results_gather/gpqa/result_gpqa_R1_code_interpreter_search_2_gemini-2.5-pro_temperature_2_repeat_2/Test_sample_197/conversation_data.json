    "This problem requires calculating the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, out of all possible cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The equilibrium reactions are:\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)+]`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3-]`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4^2-]`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   `β1 = [Co(SCN)+] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `β2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `β3 = [Co(SCN)3-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2-] / ([Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co^2+` ions and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]`:\n*   `[Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\nThe fraction of a specific species, for example, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. This is known as the distribution coefficient, `α2`.\n\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions above, we get:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1*[Co^2+]*[SCN-] + β2*[Co^2+]*[SCN-]^2 + ...)`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe are given `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`. The problem states the total cobalt concentration is `10^-2 M`, which is ten times smaller than the ligand concentration. This means the concentration of free `SCN-` will be very close to the total `SCN-` concentration, so we can use `[SCN-] = 0.1 M` in our calculation.\n\nLet's calculate each term in the formula for `α2`:\n*   Numerator: `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n*   Sum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, we can find `α2`:\n`α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis can be verified with a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the alpha expression, which is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# The numerator for alpha2 is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_alpha2=}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, out of all cobalt-containing species. This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation.\n\n**1. Define the Species and Equilibria**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) are in equilibrium with several complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free metal ion and all the complexes:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate ligand concentration `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants (`β`):\n*   `[Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n**3. Formulate the Fraction (α)**\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, in this case, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This is known as the distribution coefficient, `α2`.\n\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n\nFactor out `[Co^2+]`:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNow substitute this into the `α2` formula:\n\n`α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, giving us a formula that only depends on the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`:\n\n`α2 = (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M` (Since the ligand concentration is 10 times the metal concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration with the total ligand concentration).\n*   `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n`Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the denominator terms:\n*   Term 0: `1`\n*   Term 1: `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   Term 2: `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n*   Term 3: `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n*   Term 4: `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nCalculate `α2`:\n`α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nConvert to a percentage:\n`Percentage = α2 * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThe python code executed previously confirms this calculation, yielding `16.916...%`. This value rounds to `16.9%`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
