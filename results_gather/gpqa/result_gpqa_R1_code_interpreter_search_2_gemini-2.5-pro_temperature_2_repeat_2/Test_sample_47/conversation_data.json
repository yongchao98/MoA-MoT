    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a 6-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Br2\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone. A bromine atom is added to one of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is a classic example of the Favorskii rearrangement. An α-halo ketone treated with a strong base undergoes a ring contraction (if cyclic).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic α-proton from the carbon on the other side of the carbonyl (C6).\n    2.  The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular SN2 reaction, forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate, leading to the opening of the three-membered ring.\n    4.  The cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion, which results in the formation of a cyclopentanecarboxylate salt.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (which is implied before the next step), the salt is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is the reagent for this transformation, and pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride. The -OH of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reduction reaction. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH4, which would reduce an acid chloride all the way to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(OtBu)3 is specifically used to stop the reduction at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The acid chloride group (-COCl) is reduced to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and H), the C-H bond on the carbon attached to the aldehyde (C1), and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogens (or sets of equivalent hydrogens):**\n    1.  **Aldehyde H:** The hydrogen of the -CHO group. It lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1-H:** The hydrogen on the carbon atom of the ring to which the aldehyde group is attached. This hydrogen also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2-H and C5-H:** Carbons C2 and C5 are adjacent to C1 and are equivalent by reflection through the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on C2 (an axial and an equatorial one in the envelope conformation, or more formally, two diastereotopic hydrogens) are not equivalent to each other. One is 'cis' and one is 'trans' relative to the aldehyde group. By symmetry, the 'cis' hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' hydrogen on C5. The 'trans' hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' hydrogen on C5. This gives two more distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3-H and C4-H:** Carbons C3 and C4 are also equivalent by reflection through the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4 by symmetry. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total:** Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThere are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This would correspond to 6 unique signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
