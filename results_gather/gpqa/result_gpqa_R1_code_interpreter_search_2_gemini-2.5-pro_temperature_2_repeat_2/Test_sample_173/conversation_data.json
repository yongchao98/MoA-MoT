    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its total energy is its rest-mass energy: E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n    *   Its initial momentum is p_initial = 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate m1 as the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies and Q-value**\n\nIt's most convenient to work with energy units (GeV) throughout the problem.\n\n*   From m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M, we can multiply by c^2 to get the sum of rest-mass energies:\n    *   m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   From m1 = 2 * m2, we get m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2).\n*   Now we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Substitute the second equation into the first: 2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV.\n    *   3 * (m2*c^2) = 297 GeV  =>  m2*c^2 = 99 GeV.\n    *   Therefore, m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is released as kinetic energy (T) for the fragments. This is the Q-value of the fission.\n    *   Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Relativistic Calculation of Kinetic Energy (T1)**\n\nWe use two conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total final energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) equals the initial energy.\n    *   (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2) = M*c^2\n    *   (198 + T1) + (99 + T2) = 300 GeV\n    *   T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. (This confirms our Q-value calculation).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum was zero, so the final total momentum must also be zero. The fragments fly apart with equal magnitude and opposite direction momenta.\n    *   |p1| = |p2| = p.\n\nNow, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2. This can be rewritten to find momentum: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2).\n\nApplying this to both fragments:\n*   (p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)\n*   (p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)\n\nSince the momenta (p) are equal, we can set the right-hand sides equal:\nT1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)\n\nWe also know T2 = 3 - T1. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies (all in GeV):\nT1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*99\nT1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)\nT1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603\n396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603\n600*T1 = 603\nT1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\nConverting to MeV: T1 = 1.005 * 1000 MeV = 1005 MeV.\n\n**4. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)**\n\nIn classical mechanics:\n*   Kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   From momentum conservation, p1 = p2 = p.\n*   So, T1_c = p^2 / (2*m1) and T2_c = p^2 / (2*m2).\n\nWe can find the ratio of kinetic energies:\nT1_c / T2_c = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1/2.\nSo, T2_c = 2 * T1_c.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still the same Q-value = 3 GeV.\nT1_c + T2_c = 3 GeV\nT1_c + 2*T1_c = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_c = 3 GeV\nT1_c = 1 GeV.\n\nConverting to MeV: T1_classical = 1 * 1000 MeV = 1000 MeV.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = T1 - T1_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
