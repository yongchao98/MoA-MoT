    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mott-Gurney Equation:**\n    The equation is $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$.\n    This equation describes the current density (J) in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The name \"space-charge-limited\" itself is a major clue. It implies that the current is not limited by how many charge carriers can be injected from the contact, but rather by the build-up of a cloud of charge (space charge) within the device. This space charge creates its own electric field that opposes the applied field, thus limiting the current flow.\n\n2.  **Derive the Key Assumptions for SCLC:**\n    For the current to be limited by space charge, several conditions must be met:\n    *   **Carrier Injection:** The injecting electrode must be able to supply more carriers than the bulk of the device can transport. This means the contact must have a very low or zero energy barrier for carrier injection. Such a contact is called an \"Ohmic contact.\" A \"Schottky contact,\" which is rectifying and has a significant energy barrier, would lead to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current.\n    *   **Carrier Transport:** The standard Mott-Gurney model simplifies the transport physics. It assumes only one type of charge carrier is mobile (e.g., only electrons are injected and move, or only holes are). Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. If both carriers were mobile (a **two-carrier device**), recombination would occur, which is not accounted for in this simple model.\n    *   **Material Purity (Traps):** The simplest form of the Mott-Gurney law assumes an ideal, **trap-free** semiconductor. If traps (localized energy states in the bandgap) were present, injected carriers would first fill these traps. This would lead to a different current-voltage relationship until all traps are filled, at which point the trap-free SCLC behavior would take over. The equation provided is for the trap-free case.\n    *   **Transport Mechanism:** The total current density is the sum of drift current (due to the electric field) and diffusion current (due to carrier concentration gradients). The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law explicitly assumes that the device is thick enough and the voltage is high enough that the **diffusion current is negligible** compared to the drift current. The current is fundamentally a **drift** phenomenon in this model.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on these Assumptions:**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   *Incorrect.* The model assumes single-carrier transport. The presence of a second carrier type would introduce recombination, which is not included in the model.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   *Incorrect.* This statement claims the *drift* current is negligible. This is fundamentally wrong. The SCLC is a drift-driven current. The derivation is based on the drift current equation ($J = nq\\mu E$). It is the *diffusion* current that is assumed to be negligible.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   *Correct.* This statement accurately captures all the key assumptions:\n            *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n            *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n            *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": This is the definition of a perfect Ohmic contact required for SCLC, ensuring the current is limited by the bulk space charge, not the injection process. Correct.\n            *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct, as the model is based on drift.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   *Incorrect.* A Schottky contact has an energy barrier and would limit carrier injection. This leads to injection-limited (e.g., thermionic emission) rather than space-charge-limited current. An Ohmic contact is required for SCLC.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option C provides the most accurate and complete set of conditions for the validity of the simple Mott-Gurney law.\n\n<<<C>>>"
