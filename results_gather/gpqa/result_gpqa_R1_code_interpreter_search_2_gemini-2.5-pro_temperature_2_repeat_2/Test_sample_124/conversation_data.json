    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is described by the potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2r^2$. The Hamiltonian for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates, $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where each $H_i$ is the Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the $i$-th dimension ($i=x, y, z$).\n\nThe total energy of the three-dimensional system is the sum of the energies of the three independent one-dimensional oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet the principal quantum number be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nWe can now find the energies for the different states:\n1.  **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is when $n=0$.\n    $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0$. The only possible combination of non-negative integers is $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    The energy of the ground state is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n2.  **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next energy level, which is when $n=1$.\n    $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 1$.\n    The energy of the first excited state is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$.\n    The energy of the second excited state is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    The energy of the third excited state is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThis gives us the first part of the answer. The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level. This is the degeneracy of the state, which is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\nThe possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:\n*   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0)\n    *   (0, 3, 0)\n    *   (0, 0, 3)\n    This gives 3 states.\n\n*   One quantum number is 2, another is 1, and the third is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0)\n    *   (2, 0, 1)\n    *   (1, 2, 0)\n    *   (0, 2, 1)\n    *   (1, 0, 2)\n    *   (0, 1, 2)\n    This gives 6 states.\n\n*   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1)\n    This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) for the third excited state is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\nB) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\nC) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10 - Incorrect energy.\nD) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
