    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution containing dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4^-) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n    *   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O in a volume of 200.00 cm3 (which is 0.200 L).\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely in water to form K+ and H2PO4- ions. H2PO4- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a hydrated salt that dissolves in water to form 2Na+, HPO4^2-, and 2H2O. HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.\n    *   We have a buffer solution composed of a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-).\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.**\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L.\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = (Mass of KH2PO4) / (Molar mass of KH2PO4) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]) = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = (Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O) / (Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]) = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The pH of this buffer is governed by the equilibrium between H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n    *   Equilibrium reaction: H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n    *   The expression for Ka2 is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   Using the initial concentrations as a good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations (because the dissociation is small):\n        [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.11x10^-8 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n    *   Equilibrium reaction: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n    *   The expression for Ka3 is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the unknown, [PO4^3-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   Now, we plug in the values we have calculated. We can assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because Ka3 is extremely small, meaning very little HPO4^2- dissociates.\n        [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10^-8 M)\n        [PO4^3-] = 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculations using a python script.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\n\n# Masses and Volume\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00 # g\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00 # g\nvolume_L = 0.200 # L\n\n# Dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+]\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] -> [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-]\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] -> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f'{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}')\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is 6.24x10^-7 M, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
