    "**1. Analyzing dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Atropisomerism:** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky groups at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6'), free rotation around the central C-C single bond is hindered. This phenomenon is known as steric hindrance.\n*   **Chirality:** In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar (lying in the same plane). This restricted rotation creates a stable, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** When the rings are twisted out of the plane, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. A molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image is chiral. Due to this axial chirality (chirality arising from a chiral axis), the molecule can exist as a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism. This is a classic example of atropisomerism.\n\n**2. Analyzing methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`. This is an ester derived from lactic acid.\n*   **Chiral Center:** Optical isomerism commonly arises from the presence of a chiral center (also called a stereocenter or asymmetric carbon atom). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis of Carbon-2:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   Since all four groups attached to this carbon atom are different, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral and thus optically active. It can exist as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. Analyzing benzophenone:**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is `C6H5-CO-C6H5`, which is a diphenyl ketone.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is symmetric. The central carbonyl carbon is bonded to two identical phenyl groups. Even if the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the C=O group, the molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C=O bond. A molecule with such symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. Analyzing dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`. It is a trans-isomer, meaning the two `-COOCH3` groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. It has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you take any atom, move it in a straight line through this center, and go the same distance on the other side, you will land on an identical atom. The molecule also has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the C=C bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the organic moieties that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
