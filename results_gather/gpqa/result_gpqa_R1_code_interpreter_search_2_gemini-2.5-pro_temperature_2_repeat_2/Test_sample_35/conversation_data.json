    "Distance: 2.1 Gpc\nRedshift (z): 0.4903\nCalculated Emitted Energy: 5.8123 micro-eV\nEnergy of HI 21-cm line: 5.8743 micro-eV\n\n The question asks to identify which component of the interstellar medium in the Milky Way corresponds to a specific absorption line. The line has an observed energy of 3.9 micro-electron volts (µeV) from a source at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Account for Cosmological Redshift:** The source of the absorption is at a very large cosmological distance (2.1 Gpc). Due to the expansion of the universe, the light from this source is redshifted, meaning its wavelength is stretched and its energy is decreased by the time it reaches us. The observed energy (E_obs) is lower than the energy when it was emitted (E_emitted). We need to calculate this original, or \"rest-frame,\" energy.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The relationship between recessional velocity (v) and distance (D) is given by the Hubble-Lemaître Law: `v = H₀ * D`, where H₀ is the Hubble constant. The redshift `z` can then be estimated.\n    *   Distance, D = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Megaparsecs (Mpc)\n    *   Hubble Constant, H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc (a widely accepted value)\n    *   Recessional Velocity, v = 70 km/s/Mpc * 2100 Mpc = 147,000 km/s\n    *   Redshift, z = v / c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.49\n\n3.  **Calculate the Emitted Energy:** The relationship between observed energy and emitted energy is `E_emitted = E_obs * (1 + z)`.\n    *   Observed Energy, E_obs = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n    *   Emitted Energy, E_emitted = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49) = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.49 ≈ 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\n4.  **Identify the Corresponding Transition in the Milky Way:** Now we must find a known spectral line from a component of the interstellar medium that has an energy of approximately 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV. The most prominent radio-frequency line in astrophysics is the **21-cm line** of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). This line arises from the hyperfine transition (a flip in the relative spin of the proton and electron).\n    *   The frequency of the 21-cm line is 1420.4 MHz.\n    *   We can calculate its energy using Planck's equation, E = hν:\n        E = (4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) * (1420.4 x 10⁶ s⁻¹) ≈ 5.87 x 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated emitted energy (5.81 µeV) is an excellent match for the energy of the 21-cm HI line (5.87 µeV). Therefore, the observation is of the redshifted 21-cm line. The question asks what this absorption line would trace in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The 21-cm line is produced by neutral atomic hydrogen. When seen in *absorption*, it preferentially traces regions where this gas is dense and cold, as this creates a strong absorption feature against a background radio source. This component of the interstellar medium is known as the **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium** (or Cold Neutral Medium, CNM). The warm atomic gas is too diffuse to produce a significant absorption signature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
