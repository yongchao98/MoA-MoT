    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This relationship is typically for the cumulative number of stars, meaning the total number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n\n2.  **Establish the connection between parallax and distance:** Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related. The fundamental definition is `r = 1/plx`. This implies `plx = 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance:** Since we want to understand how the number of stars changes with distance, we need to substitute the distance relationship into our initial proportionality. A star with a parallax greater than `plx` is closer than the corresponding distance `r`. Therefore, the cumulative number of stars up to a distance `r`, let's call it `N(<r)`, is proportional to `plx⁻⁵`.\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the proportionality:\n    `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    Simplifying the exponent gives:\n    `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n    This means the total number of stars within a radius `r` from the observer is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of stars per unit distance:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is mathematically equivalent to finding the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to `r`, or `dN/dr`.\n\n    Starting from the proportionality `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`, we can write it as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n    `N(<r) = k * r⁵`\n\n    Now, we differentiate this equation with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = k * 5 * r⁴`\n\n    From this result, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n5.  **Match the result with the given options:** The derived proportionality `~ r⁴` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
