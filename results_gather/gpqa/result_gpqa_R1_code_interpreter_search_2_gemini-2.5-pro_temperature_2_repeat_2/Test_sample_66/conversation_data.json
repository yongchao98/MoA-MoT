    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital ($l_1=1$, $l_2=1$). Their orbital angular momenta are coupled to form a total angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is the \"coupled basis\" representation. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$. This means a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, will *always* yield the value $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n    *   **Final State:** A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome: the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is represented in the \"uncoupled basis\" as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   So, the final state we are projecting onto is $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Relate the States using Conservation Law:**\n    The key principle in coupling angular momentum is that the z-components add up. The total z-component quantum number $m$ must equal the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers ($m_1$ and $m_2$).\n    \n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n    This is a fundamental selection rule. If this condition is not met, the transition or projection between the states is impossible.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Law to the Problem:**\n    *   From the initial coupled state, $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final (measured) state, we need $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the conservation law is satisfied:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n    *   We compare the initial $m$ with the sum $m_1+m_2$:\n        $m = -1$\n        $m_1+m_2 = -2$\n    *   Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met.\n\n4.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    The probability of finding the system in the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ after starting from $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the two states:\n    \n    $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n    \n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated, this coefficient is zero.\n    \n    Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    In simpler terms, the initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The final state we are testing for has a total z-component of angular momentum of $(-1\\hbar) + (-1\\hbar) = -2\\hbar$. Since the measurement of the individual components cannot change the total angular momentum of the isolated system, it's impossible to get this result. The probability is zero.\n\nTo be absolutely sure, we can calculate the exact Clebsch-Gordan coefficient using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\n\n# This code calculates the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1,m1; l2,m2 | l,m>\n# which represents the amplitude for finding the system in the uncoupled state |l1,m1; l2,m2>\n# when it is in the coupled state |l,m>.\n# The problem gives:\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n# The desired measurement outcome corresponds to:\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# SymPy's CG function format is CG(j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m)\ncg_coefficient = CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m).doit()\n\n# The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient.\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: {cg_coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The joint probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: 0\nThe joint probability is: 0\n</execute_result>\n\nThe Python code confirms that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0, and therefore the probability is also 0.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State**\n    The system is initially in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   $l_2=1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$).\n    This means that if we measure the total angular momentum z-component, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, the result is guaranteed to be $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Final State**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is an eigenstate of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, which is described in the *uncoupled* basis by the ket $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    A fundamental principle in coupling angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components. This means the quantum numbers must satisfy the relation:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This rule must hold for the system. If it doesn't, the probability of finding the system in that particular state configuration is zero.\n\n4.  **Check the Quantum Numbers**\n    Let's check if this rule is satisfied for our specific case:\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Their sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    We compare the required sum with the initial value of $m$:\n    $m_{initial} = -1$\n    $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = -2$\n\n    Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the conservation rule is violated.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The state we are trying to measure has a total z-component of angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$. However, the system was initially in a state with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. A measurement of the individual components cannot change the total angular momentum of the system. Therefore, it is impossible to obtain the desired measurement result. The probability of this outcome is exactly 0.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a condition for this coefficient to be non-zero. Since the condition is not met, the coefficient is zero, and thus the probability is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
