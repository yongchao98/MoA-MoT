    "This problem requires analyzing spectral data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to determine the correct molecular formula for an unknown compound from a given list.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H stretch is also in this region but is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is unsaturated.\n\n**Summary from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. It contains a -COOH group and a C=C bond.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid functional group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H)\n    *   Mass ≈ 12 + 2 * 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment peak is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, resulting from cleavage next to the carbonyl group.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Chemical Formulas:**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence strongly suggests the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means it must contain at least one C=C bond and one -COOH group.\n*   The -COOH group requires **2 oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n*   We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2). Now we must consider the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n*   Our molecule has at least one C=C bond (one degree of unsaturation) and one C=O bond from the carboxylic acid (a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the molecule must have a **DoU of at least 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n*   **A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This formula is consistent with all the spectral data.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 can only account for one pi bond (either a C=C or a C=O), but not both. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly the molecular formula C6H10O2 fits all the given information. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid, and its degree of unsaturation of 2 accounts for both the C=C double bond and the C=O double bond observed in the spectra.\n\n<<<A>>>"
