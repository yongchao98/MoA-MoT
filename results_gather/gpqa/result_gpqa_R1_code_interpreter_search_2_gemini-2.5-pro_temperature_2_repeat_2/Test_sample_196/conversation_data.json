    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the functional groups in Compound X from the IR spectrum.**\n    *   The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretches within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Elucidate the full structure of Compound X from the ¹H NMR spectrum.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Substituent Analysis:** We need to piece together the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This is the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to both the methyl group (3H) and the methine group (1H).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton). It is a multiplet because it's coupled to the protons of the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We can connect the pieces: The benzylic -CH- is bonded to both an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a methyl group (-CH₃). This forms a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the parts to determine the full structure of Compound X.**\n    *   We have a benzene ring substituted at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   The other substituent is a *sec*-butyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n    *   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and HI**.\n    *   This is a very powerful reducing agent combination. A key reaction of Red P / HI is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   Reaction: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group. The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected under these conditions.\n    *   Product: The benzoic acid becomes a methylbenzene (toluene). The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid has an incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has the wrong alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of *sec*-butyl).\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene matches our predicted product perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
