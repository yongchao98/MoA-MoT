    "*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B and the heavy isotope.**\n    The prompt states that a precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavy hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very close match. Therefore, substance B is heavy water (D₂O), and the heavy isotope mentioned in the problem is Deuterium (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Substance X, Y, W, and G.**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" is D. Substance X must be a deuterated compound.\n    *   Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A common class of reagents are reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBD₄).\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's test potential gases:\n        *   Hydrogen (H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   Helium (⁴He): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Possible, but typically formed in nuclear reactions, not standard chemical reactions.\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). Yes.\n        *   Nitrogen (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7). Yes.\n        *   Oxygen (¹⁶O₂): 16 protons (8+8), 16 neutrons (8+8). Yes.\n    *   Let's assume X is LiAlD₄. This is a powerful reducing agent. It reacts violently with protic substances like water. If liquid Y is D₂O (heavy water), the reaction would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: A deuterated analog of a common organic reagent (LiAlH₄). Check.\n        *   **Y = D₂O**: A liquid. Check.\n        *   **Reaction is violent**: The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent, so this is consistent. Check.\n        *   **Gas W = D₂**: Contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Check.\n        *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃**: Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a precipitate, so aluminum deuteroxide should be as well. Check.\n        *   **Heating G releases B**: When heated, metal hydroxides/deuteroxides dehydrate. `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. So B is D₂O. Check. This matches our initial finding from the melting point.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify with the final clue.**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group. It has 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH.\n    *   The product is a diol (containing two alcohol groups), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This clue confirms the identity of X as a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Step 4: Perform the calculation.**\n    *   Substance X has been identified as **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present in substance X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is defined by the lowest atomic number (Z). Here, it is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The heaviest element is defined by the highest atomic number. Here, it is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". This means we need to sum the masses of all atoms of Hydrogen and all atoms of Aluminum in the formula LiAlD₄.\n    *   The prompt adds a clarifying instruction: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This confirms we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the element in the formula.\n    *   For the calculation, we use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Aluminum: The only stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass number = 27.\n        *   Hydrogen: The isotope present in X is Deuterium (²H or D). Mass number = 2.\n    *   Now, we sum the masses based on the formula LiAlD₄:\n        *   Mass contribution from Aluminum (heaviest element): There is 1 atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   Mass contribution from Hydrogen (lightest element): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
