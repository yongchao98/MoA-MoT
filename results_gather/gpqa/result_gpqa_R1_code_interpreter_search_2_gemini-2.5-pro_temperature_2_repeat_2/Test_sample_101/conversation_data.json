The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:** The goal is to track a ligand-receptor pair from neural crest cells using a Cre-Lox system. A single bicistronic construct is created to express both the ligand and the receptor.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the vector:**\n    *   **Promoter:** CBA (Chicken Beta-Actin) promoter is a strong, ubiquitous promoter. It will drive expression in most cell types, so it does not require a cell-specific enhancer.\n    *   **First Gene (Ligand):** Ligand ORF is followed by a `loxP-STOP-loxP` cassette, and then mCherry. This means that without Cre recombinase, only the Ligand protein is made. With Cre, the STOP cassette is removed, and a Ligand-mCherry fusion protein should be produced.\n    *   **IRES:** The Internal Ribosome Entry Site allows for the translation of the second gene (the receptor) from the same mRNA molecule.\n    *   **Second Gene (Receptor):** The IRES is followed by the Receptor ORF, then a `lox2272-STOP-lox2272` cassette, and finally eGFP fused to the C-terminus. Similar to the ligand, this means that without Cre, only the Receptor protein is made. With Cre, the STOP cassette is removed, and a Receptor-eGFP fusion protein should be produced.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the preliminary test (Western Blot):**\n    *   The construct was transfected into primary astrocytes (which do not express Cre recombinase).\n    *   A Western blot was performed using antibodies against the ligand and receptor proteins.\n    *   The result: \"Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading.\" This phrasing is slightly ambiguous but is standard lab jargon implying that the specific antibodies detected their target proteins (ligand and receptor), and the signal intensity was as expected when compared to the loading control (actin).\n    *   **Conclusion from this test:** In the absence of Cre, the construct is successfully transcribed and translated to produce the Ligand protein (stopping before mCherry) and the Receptor protein (stopping before eGFP). This confirms the CBA promoter and IRES element are functional, and the ORFs for the ligand and receptor are correct up to the STOP cassettes.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the in vivo experiment (Mouse model):**\n    *   A mouse homozygous for the construct (`Lox-construct/Lox-construct`) is crossed with a SOX10-Cre mouse. SOX10 is a marker for the neural crest, so Cre recombinase will be expressed specifically in neural crest-derived cells.\n    *   In the offspring, any cell that expresses SOX10 will have active Cre recombinase.\n    *   **Expected outcome in SOX10+ cells:** Cre recombinase should excise both the `loxP`-flanked STOP cassette and the `lox2272`-flanked STOP cassette. This should lead to the production of both red (Ligand-mCherry) and green (Receptor-eGFP) fluorescent proteins.\n    *   **Actual observation:** \"You do not observe a green signal.\" This means the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein is either not being made, or it is not fluorescent.\n\n5.  **Assess the potential explanations (the options provided):**\n\n    *   **A) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** This is incorrect. The construct uses the strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter, which does not need a specific downstream enhancer. The Western blot experiment already proved that the promoter drives expression of the proteins (receptor and ligand) in cultured cells.\n\n    *   **B) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** A paracrine relationship (signal from one cell to a neighboring cell) describes the biological function of the pair. It has no bearing on whether a genetically engineered construct can successfully produce a fluorescent fusion protein within a single cell. This is irrelevant to the technical failure of the reporter.\n\n    *   **C) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a highly plausible explanation. For the Receptor-eGFP fusion to be successful, the open reading frame (ORF) of the receptor must be continuous with the ORF of eGFP after the STOP cassette is removed by Cre. Cre-mediated excision leaves a small \"scar\" sequence. If there was a mistake in the vector design (e.g., the number of base pairs from the start of the receptor to the start of eGFP, including the scar, is not a multiple of three), a frameshift mutation will occur. The ribosome will translate the receptor correctly, but then it will translate the eGFP portion in the wrong frame, producing a non-functional, non-fluorescent polypeptide. This scenario is perfectly consistent with all observations: the Western blot worked because it detected the correctly-translated receptor part (pre-Cre), but the fluorescence failed because the eGFP part was not translated correctly (post-Cre).\n\n    *   **D) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it traffics through the ER-Golgi pathway. If the eGFP fusion caused misfolding, it could be retained in the ER or Golgi. However, if this were the case, the eGFP itself would likely still be fluorescent. A confocal microscope would detect a green signal, but it would be localized to the perinuclear region (Golgi/ER pattern) instead of the cell membrane. The problem states there is *no* green signal observed, implying a complete absence of fluorescence, not just mislocalization. Therefore, this option is less likely than a frameshift that prevents the formation of a fluorescent protein altogether.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most logical reason for the complete absence of a green signal, despite the successful preliminary expression test, is that the receptor and the eGFP tag are out of frame with each other in the post-recombination construct.\n\n<<<C>>>"
