    "SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian with higher-dimensional operators, respecting the fundamental principles of quantum field theory and the observed symmetries of the SM gauge group SU(3)c x SU(2)L x U(1)Y. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is the symmetry of spacetime under rotations and boosts. It is a fundamental postulate of special relativity and a cornerstone of any quantum field theory (QFT) describing particle physics as we know it, including the Standard Model and its effective field theory extensions. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, by construction, must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry**: This is the full symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime, including Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational assumption in the construction of a standard QFT. Therefore, Poincare symmetry **must** be respected. Note that respecting Poincare symmetry automatically implies respecting Lorentz symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry (Charge-Parity)**: This is the symmetry under the combined operation of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established experimentally that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably through the complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it not only accommodates the SM's CP violation but can also introduce new sources of it through higher-dimensional operators. Thus, CP symmetry is **not** required to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time)**: The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. It states that any theory that is local, Lorentz-invariant, and has a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it automatically respects CPT symmetry. Violating CPT would require a radical departure from the fundamental framework of QFT itself. Therefore, CPT symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe symmetries that are fundamental assumptions in the construction of the SMEFT and must be respected by all its operators are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of symmetries is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
