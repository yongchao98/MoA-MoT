    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants me to solve a two-part question about isomerism.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nFirst, I need to identify which of the two compounds, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does *not* show tautomerism.\n\n1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of constitutional isomerism where two structures (tautomers) are in equilibrium and readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O). The α-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    *   α-Carbons: The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are the carbons of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   α-Hydrogens: While these α-carbons have hydrogens, they are attached to sp² carbons. Keto-enol tautomerism generally involves the removal of a proton from an sp³ α-carbon.\n    *   If benzoquinone were to tautomerize into its corresponding \"enol\" form (1,4-dihydroxybenzene, also known as hydroquinone), the reaction would be C₆H₄O₂ → C₆H₆O₂. This involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms, meaning the molecular formulas are different. Therefore, benzoquinone and hydroquinone are not tautomers. They are related by a redox reaction.\n    *   Since benzoquinone lacks the necessary sp³ α-hydrogens and cannot interconvert to an isomer with the same molecular formula, it **does not** exhibit tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered saturated ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. The molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n    *   α-Carbons: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all α-carbons, as they are adjacent to carbonyl groups. In fact, each is adjacent to two carbonyl groups.\n    *   α-Hydrogens: Each of these α-carbons has two hydrogens. These hydrogens are very acidic because the negative charge left behind after removing a proton (carbanion) is stabilized by resonance with two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Tautomerization: Due to the presence of these acidic α-hydrogens, the compound readily undergoes tautomerization. It converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula of phloroglucinol. It is an aromatic ring with three -OH groups, so its formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n    *   Since cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and phloroglucinol have the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃) and are interconvertible, they are tautomers. The driving force for this equilibrium is the high stability of the aromatic phloroglucinol.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** exhibit tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, A = benzoquinone.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nNext, I need to identify which of the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). A chiral molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image (an enantiomer).\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃. It is an ester, also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   Chiral Center Analysis: Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   These four groups are all different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S).\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   Chiral Center Analysis: There are no sp³ carbons bonded to four different groups. In fact, there are no tetrahedral carbons other than those in the methyl groups.\n    *   Symmetry Analysis: The molecule has a double bond, and the *trans* configuration places the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides. The molecule is essentially planar and possesses a center of inversion. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is identical to the original molecule and can be perfectly superimposed.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
