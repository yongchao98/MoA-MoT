    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectroscopic data is given:\n        *   `1H NMR`: a single peak at 7 ppm.\n        *   `13C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        The `1H` NMR shows a single signal in the alkene region (typically 5-7.5 ppm), indicating two chemically equivalent vinylic protons. The `13C` NMR shows a signal in the alkene region (~137 ppm) and one in the carbonyl region (~165 ppm). This perfectly matches the structure of **maleic anhydride**. Due to its C2v symmetry, it has only one type of proton and two types of carbons (vinylic and carbonyl).\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. Let's verify the molecular formula calculation given in the problem:\n        *   Diene (C9H14): The cyclopentadiene ring has 5 carbons. The problem states there are 4 methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. This leaves the C5 position as a CH2 group. The formula is C5H2(ring) + 4x(CH3) = C9H14.\n        *   Dienophile (C4H2O3): Maleic anhydride.\n        *   Product: The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder). The molecular formula of the product is C9H14 + C4H2O3 = **C13H16O3**. This matches the information given.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction. When a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene reacts with a dienophile, it can form two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which is consistent with the formation of these two stereoisomers.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures of the *endo* and *exo* products. The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n        *   **Product Skeleton:** It has a six-membered ring in a boat conformation, bridged by a CH2 group (C7).\n        *   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C2, C3). The anhydride ring is fused at C5 and C6. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are attached at C5 and C6 (let's call them **H_a**).\n        *   ***Endo* Isomer:** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the molecule as the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the **H_a** protons point \"outward\" (in the *exo* direction).\n        *   ***Exo* Isomer:** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the **H_a** protons point \"inward\" toward the C7 bridge (in the *endo* direction).\n\n3.  **Interpret the NMR Data and NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   **NOESY:** This 2D NMR technique shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Ã…). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the major isomer but far apart in the minor one.\n    *   **Assigning 1H NMR signals:** Based on typical chemical shifts and the symmetry of the products (both isomers have a C2 axis of symmetry), we can assign the signals mentioned in the options:\n        *   **`~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`**: These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion (**H_a**). Their shift is downfield due to the adjacent carbonyl groups. They are a singlet because they are chemically equivalent.\n        *   **`~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls, **Me_v**). Vinylic methyl protons typically resonate in this region.\n        *   **`~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (bridgehead methyls, **Me_bh**). These aliphatic methyl groups are more shielded and thus appear at a higher field (lower ppm).\n\n4.  **Relate NOE to Structure and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Now, let's analyze the spatial proximities in the two isomers to predict the key NOE signal.\n        *   In the ***Exo* Isomer**: The **H_a** protons are in the *endo* position. They are located directly under the C=C double bond of the bicyclic system. This brings them very close to the vinylic methyl groups (**Me_v**). A strong NOE cross-peak between **H_a** and **Me_v** is expected.\n        *   In the ***Endo* Isomer**: The **H_a** protons are in the *exo* position. They are on the outer face of the molecule, far away from the vinylic methyl groups (**Me_v**). Therefore, a NOE between H_a and Me_v would be absent or very weak. (In the *endo* isomer, an NOE might be observed between H_a and the bridgehead methyls, Me_bh).\n\n5.  **Identify the Major Product:**\n    *   The Alder-Eno rule generally predicts that the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (major) product. However, this rule is often overridden by severe steric hindrance.\n    *   In this reaction, the diene is heavily substituted with four bulky methyl groups. During the *endo* transition state, the carbonyl groups of the approaching maleic anhydride would experience significant steric repulsion from the methyl groups on the diene.\n    *   The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride points away from the diene's methyl groups, is sterically much less demanding.\n    *   Therefore, it is highly likely that the **`Exo` isomer is the major product** in this sterically hindered reaction.\n\n6.  **Combine the Findings to Determine the Answer:**\n    *   The major product is the *exo* isomer.\n    *   The *exo* isomer is characterized by a strong NOE between the **H_a** protons and the vinylic methyl groups (**Me_v**). This NOE is absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation given in the problem.\n    *   The signal for **H_a** is the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`.\n    *   The signal for **Me_v** is the `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm`.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak observed in the spectrum of the major product connects the `6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm` and the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
