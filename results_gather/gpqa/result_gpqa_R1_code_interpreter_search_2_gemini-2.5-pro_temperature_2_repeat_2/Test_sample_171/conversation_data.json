    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical law:** The problem describes the relative population of atoms in different energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population ratio.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms `N_j` in an excited energy level `j` to the number of atoms `N_i` in a lower energy level `i` is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:** Let's denote the population ratio `(N_j / N_i)` for star_1 as `R_1` and for star_2 as `R_2`. The temperatures are `T_1` and `T_2` respectively.\n    *   For star_1: `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2: `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the given information:** The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 compared to star_2.\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n5.  **Set up the equation:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from the previous step.\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars (as it concerns the same energy levels of the same atom, iron) and cancels out from both sides.\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Isolate the temperatures:** To solve for the relationship involving the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides of the equation.\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    Using logarithm properties (`ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(exp(x)) = x`), we get:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation:** We can rearrange the terms to solve for `ln(2)`.\n    `ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n    Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n9.  **Consider the numerical values:** The problem gives `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental physical constant with the value `k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n    The ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n    The provision of this specific value for `ΔE` is a strong indicator that it's intended to simplify the equation.\n\n10. **Final Equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1 K` into our derived equation:\n    `ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    The units work out correctly: `ln(2)` is dimensionless, and the right side is `[K] * ([K]/[K^2]) = [K] * [1/K]`, which is also dimensionless.\n    Assuming the question asks for the form of the equation where the coefficient is 1 (based on the provided `ΔE`), the equation becomes:\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n11. **Compare with options:** This final form matches option C exactly. The other options have incorrect algebraic forms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
