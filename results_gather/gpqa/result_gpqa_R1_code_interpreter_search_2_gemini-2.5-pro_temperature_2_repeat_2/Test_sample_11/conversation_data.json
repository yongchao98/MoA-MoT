    "This problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu_mu`\n\nWhere:\n*   `Pi(+)` is the parent particle (pion).\n*   `mu(+)` (muon) and `nu_mu` (muon neutrino) are the daughter particles.\n\n**Given:**\n*   The `Pi(+)` is stationary, which means its initial momentum is zero and its initial total energy is its rest mass energy.\n*   Rest mass of `Pi(+)`, `m_pi` = 139.6 MeV/c².\n*   Rest mass of `mu(+)`, `m_mu` = 105.7 MeV/c².\n*   The neutrino (`nu_mu`) is considered massless, so `m_nu` = 0.\n\nLet's denote the quantities (energy, momentum, mass) of the pion, muon, and neutrino with subscripts `pi`, `mu`, and `nu` respectively. For simplicity, we can set `c=1`. So energy and mass have units of MeV, and momentum has units of MeV/c.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. The total momentum of the final system must also be zero.\n`p_initial = p_final`\n`0 = p_mu + p_nu`\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum:\n`|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n`E_initial = E_final`\nThe initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the stationary pion:\n`E_initial = m_pi`\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n`E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\nTherefore,\n`m_pi = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. Using `c=1`, this becomes `E^2 = p^2 + m^2`.\n\n*   For the muon (`mu+`):\n    `E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2` => `E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)`\n\n*   For the neutrino (`nu`), which is massless (`m_nu = 0`):\n    `E_nu^2 = p_nu^2 + 0` => `E_nu = |p_nu| = p`.\n    For a massless particle, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, so `KE_nu = E_nu = p`.\n\nNow we can solve for the momentum `p`. Substitute the expressions for `E_mu` and `E_nu` into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p`\n\nRearrange to solve for `p`:\n`m_pi - p = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`(m_pi - p)^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2`\n`m_pi^2 - 2*m_pi*p + p^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2`\n\nThe `p^2` terms cancel out:\n`m_pi^2 - 2*m_pi*p = m_mu^2`\n\nNow, isolate `p`:\n`2*m_pi*p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2`\n`p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)`\n\nLet's plug in the given mass values to find the momentum `p` (which is also the kinetic energy of the neutrino).\n`m_pi = 139.6 MeV`\n`m_mu = 105.7 MeV`\n\n`p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`p = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`p = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`p ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is:\n`KE_nu = p ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n**3. Find the Kinetic Energy of the Muon (`KE_mu`)**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is the difference between its total energy and its rest mass energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu`.\n\nWe can find `E_mu` from the energy conservation equation:\n`E_mu = m_pi - E_nu = m_pi - p`\n`E_mu = 139.6 - 29.784`\n`E_mu = 109.816 MeV`\n\nNow, calculate `KE_mu`:\n`KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu`\n`KE_mu = 109.816 - 105.7`\n`KE_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get:\n*   `KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n*   `KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\nYou can verify the calculations using the following Python script:\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Momentum of the products (in MeV/c) is the same as the neutrino's energy/KE (in MeV)\np_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\nke_nu = p_nu\n\n# Total energy of the muon\nE_mu = m_pi - ke_nu\n\n# Kinetic energy of the muon\nke_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\nExecuting this code yields:\n```\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n```\nThese values confirm that option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (`Pi(+)`) into two product particles (`mu(+)` and `nu`). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we must apply the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Define Variables**\n\n*   `m_pi`: Rest mass of the pion `Pi(+)` = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   `m_mu`: Rest mass of the muon `mu(+)` = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   `m_nu`: Rest mass of the neutrino `nu` ≈ 0\n*   `p_mu`, `p_nu`: Momenta of the muon and neutrino\n*   `E_mu`, `E_nu`: Total energies of the muon and neutrino\n*   `KE_mu`, `KE_nu`: Kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino\n\nWe can work in a system of units where the speed of light `c=1`. In these units, mass and energy are measured in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial pion is stationary, so the initial momentum of the system is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n`p_initial = p_final`\n`0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n\nThis means the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum `p`.\n`|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the system is conserved. The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the two product particles.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`m_pi = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2`. With `c=1`, this becomes `E^2 = p^2 + m^2`.\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)`\n*   For the massless neutrino: `E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + 0^2) = p`\n\nNow substitute these into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p`\n\n**4. Solve for Momentum (p)**\n\nTo solve for `p`, we rearrange and square the equation:\n`m_pi - p = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)`\n`(m_pi - p)^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2`\n`m_pi^2 - 2 * m_pi * p + p^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2`\n\nThe `p^2` terms cancel out:\n`m_pi^2 - 2 * m_pi * p = m_mu^2`\n\nNow, solve for `p`:\n`2 * m_pi * p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2`\n`p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (`KE_nu`)**:\n    For a massless particle like the neutrino, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, which is `E_nu = p`.\n    `KE_nu = p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n    `KE_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n    `KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n    `KE_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV`\n\n    This rounds to **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (`KE_mu`)**:\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy `E_mu` minus its rest mass energy `m_mu`. We can find `E_mu` from the energy conservation equation: `E_mu = m_pi - E_nu`.\n    `E_mu = 139.6 MeV - 29.78 MeV = 109.82 MeV`\n    `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu`\n    `KE_mu = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV`\n    `KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino. These values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
