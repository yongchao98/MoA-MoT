    "This problem asks us to identify which of four mutations in a barley gene is most likely to eliminate an unwanted compound. Eliminating the compound means we need to disrupt or destroy the function of the gene that synthesizes it. The most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein.\n\nLet's analyze the gene and the mutations by looking at the DNA sequence in terms of codons (three-letter codes for amino acids). The translation of DNA into a protein starts at the `ATG` codon and continues until a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`) is reached.\n\n1.  **Intact Gene Sequence Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’\n    *   The first few codons translate to the following amino acids:\n        *   `ATG`: Methionine (Start codon)\n        *   `TTT`: Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC`: Leucine\n        *   `GCT`: Alanine\n        *   `GGT`: Glycine\n        *   ...and so on, until the `TGA` stop codon at the end.\n    This sequence produces a full-length, functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Mutants:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’\n        *   Changes from Intact: `TTT CTC` becomes `TTC TAC`.\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine. This is a *synonymous (silent) mutation* and has no effect on the amino acid sequence.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a *missense mutation*. It changes one amino acid in the protein. While this *could* disrupt protein function, it might also have a minor or no effect. It's not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’\n        *   Changes from Intact: `TTT CTC` becomes `TTC TAA`.\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Again, a silent mutation.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA` (**Stop**): This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence (at the third codon position). Protein synthesis will halt here, producing only a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (Methionine-Phenylalanine). This fragment is virtually certain to be non-functional. This type of mutation is a classic way to create a \"knockout\" or \"null\" allele, completely eliminating the gene's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’\n        *   Changes from Intact: `CTC` -> `TAC` and `ACT` -> `GTC`\n        *   This introduces two *missense mutations*: Leucine -> Tyrosine and Threonine -> Valine. Like Mutant 1, changing amino acids might alter the protein's function, but it's not as certain to eliminate it as a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’\n        *   Changes from Intact: `CTC` -> `TAC` and `GGT` -> `ACT`.\n        *   This also introduces two *missense mutations*: Leucine -> Tyrosine and Glycine -> Threonine. The reasoning is the same as for Mutants 1 and 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe goal is to most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This requires a mutation that reliably destroys the function of the enzyme encoded by the gene. Of the options provided:\n*   Missense mutations (Mutants 1, 3, 4) change amino acids, which may or may not disable the protein.\n*   A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n\nTherefore, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
