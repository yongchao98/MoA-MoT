    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Identify the Core Physics Concept\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge, observed at a point `r` and time `t`. The key is that electromagnetic information travels at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potentials at `(r, t)` do not depend on the charge's state at time `t`, but on its state at an earlier \"retarded time,\" `tr`. This is the concept of **retarded potentials**.\n\nThe given variables are:\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   `s(t)`: the trajectory of the charge.\n*   `r`: the field observation point.\n*   `t`: the time of observation.\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, when the signal was emitted.\n*   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, `v = ds(tr)/dt`.\n*   `d`: the vector from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`. So, `d = r - s(tr)`. The magnitude is `d = |d|`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that light emitted at `tr` from position `s(tr)` reaches `r` at time `t`:\n`t - tr = d/c`  or  `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n### 2. The General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\nFor a continuous charge distribution `ρ` and current density `J`, the retarded potentials are given by the Jefimenko's equations, which are solutions to Maxwell's equations:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `tr = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\n### 3. Applying the Formulas to a Point Charge\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are represented using the Dirac delta function:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`, where `v(t')` is the velocity at time `t'`.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas gives:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q * δ³(r' - s(tr))] / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [q * v(tr) * δ³(r' - s(tr))] / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Integrals (The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)\nThe tricky part is that `tr` depends on `r'`, which is the integration variable. Evaluating these integrals is a standard, but non-trivial, derivation in advanced electrodynamics. The result of the integration yields the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\nThe evaluation effectively replaces `r'` with the retarded position `s(tr)` and introduces a correction factor in the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that the volume element of the charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer due to its motion.\n\nThe resulting potentials are:\n\n`V(r,t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n`A(r,t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]`\n\nwhere `d`, `d`, and `v` are all evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Given Options\nLet's re-write the derived formulas to match the format of the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential V:**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n    `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀(cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential A:**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qv / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qvc / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π(cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNow let's check these against the options provided:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**\n    This matches our derived expressions perfectly. Note that `d c` is the same as `c d`, and the dot product `d ⋅ v` is commutative.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, ...`**\n    This is the static Coulomb potential. It neglects the motion of the charge and the retardation effect. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}, ...`**\n    The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The negative sign `(- d ⋅ v)` is crucial. It shows that the potential is enhanced if the charge is moving towards the observer (`d ⋅ v` is negative) and diminished if it is moving away.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, ...`**\n    The scalar potential is incorrect. The vector potential `A` is given as a scalar `(v²/c²)V`, which is physically impossible as `A` must be a vector.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe expressions in option A are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>"
