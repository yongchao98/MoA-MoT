    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integration:**\nThe 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals, which means there are four sets of non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n*   **7.0 ppm:** 1 proton\n*   **5.5 ppm:** 1 proton\n*   **2.1 ppm:** 3 protons\n*   **1.6 ppm:** 3 protons\nThe total number of protons is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\nLet's check the molecular formulas of the options:\n*   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): `CH3COOCHCHCH3`. The formula has 3+1+1+3 = 8 hydrogens. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): e.g., `CH3COOCH2CHCHCH3`. This would have 10 hydrogens. This does not match the integration data.\nBased on the total proton count, we can eliminate the \"butenyl acetate\" options (A and D). The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Signal:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a characteristic region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, specifically in an acetate group (CH3-C(=O)-O-).\n*   **Integration (3H):** Consistent with a methyl (-CH3) group.\n*   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons. This confirms the presence of an isolated `CH3-C(=O)-` fragment.\n\n**3. Analyze the Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):**\nThese signals indicate the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **Signal 1:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n*   **Signal 2:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n\nLet's focus on Signal 1 at 7.0 ppm.\n*   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is very downfield for a vinyl proton, suggesting it is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen of the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n*   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n*   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. A large vicinal coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond (in the range of 12-18 Hz) is definitive proof of a **trans** configuration. A cis configuration would show a much smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n\n**4. Analyze the Remaining Signals to Build the Full Structure:**\nWe have identified an acetate group `CH3COO-` and a trans double bond `H-C=C-H`. Now let's place the remaining fragments.\n*   The proton at 7.0 ppm is `H-C=`, and this carbon is attached to the oxygen `(CH3COO)-O-CH=`.\n*   The proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to the proton at 7.0 ppm (this explains the 'd' in its multiplicity, 'd'q). It is also coupled to a group of three protons (this explains the 'q' for quartet in 'd'q).\n*   The signal at `1.6 ppm (3H, d)` corresponds to a methyl group (`3H`) that is split into a doublet (`d`), meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n*   Putting it together: The proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to both the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm) and the methyl group (at 1.6 ppm). This forms the `...=CH-CH3` fragment.\n*   The complete structure is therefore `CH3COO-CH=CH-CH3`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion:**\n*   The molecular skeleton is **propenyl acetate**.\n*   The J-coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** between the two vinyl protons confirms they are in a **trans** orientation.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) Cis-butenyl acetate - Incorrect molecular formula and stereochemistry.\nB) Trans-propenyl acetate - Matches all data perfectly.\nC) Cis-propenyl acetate - Incorrect stereochemistry (would have a smaller J-coupling constant).\nD) Trans-butenyl acetate - Incorrect molecular formula.\n\nThe correct answer is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
