As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Data:**\n    *   I'll first list all the phenotypes (resistance levels) for each genotype. This helps organize the information clearly.\n    *   Control (Wild-Type): 100% resistance (baseline)\n    *   `g1` (G1 knocked out): 75% resistance (a 25% loss)\n    *   `g2` (G2 knocked out): 0% resistance (a 100% loss)\n    *   `g3` (G3 knocked out): 50% resistance (a 50% loss)\n    *   `g1g2` (double mutant): 0% resistance\n    *   `g2g3` (double mutant): 0% resistance\n    *   `g1g3` (double mutant): 10% resistance (a 90% loss)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` results in a complete loss of resistance (0%).\n    *   Crucially, any double mutant that includes `g2` (`g1g2`, `g2g3`) also has 0% resistance.\n    *   This is the definition of **epistasis**. The `g2` mutation masks the phenotype of the `g1` and `g3` mutations. When G2 is absent, the status of G1 and G3 becomes irrelevant.\n    *   In a genetic pathway, this usually means the epistatic gene (G2) acts *upstream* of the other genes (G1, G3).\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. G2 fits this description perfectly. It likely acts as a master switch that is required to turn on the resistance pathway, which involves G1 and G3.\n    *   So, my first strong conclusion is: **G2 is a transcription factor that is epistatic to G1 and G3.**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Interaction Between G1 and G3:**\n    *   Now I'll look at the `g1`, `g3`, and `g1g3` mutants to understand their relationship.\n    *   `g1` causes a 25% loss of resistance.\n    *   `g3` causes a 50% loss of resistance.\n    *   If their effects were simply additive, the double mutant `g1g3` should have a combined loss of 25% + 50% = 75%, resulting in 25% resistance (100% - 75%).\n    *   However, the observed resistance for `g1g3` is only 10% (a 90% loss).\n    *   This loss (90%) is much greater than the sum of the individual losses (75%). This type of interaction, where the double mutant phenotype is more severe than the additive expectation, is called a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   Synergistic interactions often occur when two genes perform overlapping or compensatory functions, a concept known as **gene redundancy**. They might control two parallel pathways that both contribute to the final outcome (resistance). When one pathway is knocked out, the other can still provide a significant amount of function. But when both are knocked out, the system almost completely fails.\n    *   So, my second strong conclusion is: **G1 and G3 have a synergistic interaction, which suggests they function in redundant or parallel pathways.**\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options based on my Conclusions:**\n\n    *   **Conclusion 1: G2 is a transcription factor.** This eliminates option D, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n    *   **Conclusion 2: G1 and G3 have a synergistic/redundant relationship.** I need to check which of the remaining options (A, B, C) reflects this.\n        *   Option A: \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\". This is a possible mechanism but not a description of the interaction type derived from the phenotypes. It also incorrectly claims \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" (the double mutant `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g3` phenotype of 50%).\n        *   Option B: \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\". This matches my conclusion perfectly.\n        *   Option C: \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\". Pleiotropy means a single gene affects multiple traits. The experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy. This makes option C incorrect.\n\n    *   **Final Check of Option B:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Consistent with my analysis.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": Consistent with my analysis of their synergistic interaction.\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This part is technically incorrect based on the standard definition of epistasis (where the double mutant has the phenotype of one of the single mutants). The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is different from `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%). However, compared to the other options, Option B contains two strongly supported conclusions. The inaccuracies in the other options (D claiming G1 is the TF, C claiming pleiotropy) are much more significant. Therefore, Option B is the best possible answer, despite a minor imprecision in its third statement. The core findings about G2's role and the G1-G3 redundant interaction are correctly identified.\n\n<<<B>>>"
