    "Here's a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern (all adjacent on the ring). The relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis is a sterically hindered arrangement, and synthesizing it requires careful control of substituent directing effects, often using blocking groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Key Functional Group Transformations**\n\nThe options involve several standard reactions:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (tBuCl/AlCl3):** Adds a tert-butyl group.\n*   **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Adds a nitro group.\n*   **Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** Adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H).\n*   **Reduction (Fe/HCl):** Reduces a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** Converts an amino group (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt (H3O+/Heat):** Replaces -N2+ with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4):** Removes a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This is a crucial step, indicating that the -SO3H group is used as a temporary blocking group.\n*   **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** Converts a hydroxyl group (-OH) into an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n\nThe final step in all options is the Williamson ether synthesis, which means the direct precursor to the target molecule must be the corresponding phenol: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Our goal is to find a sequence that produces this phenol.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it can produce 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Option D:** Fails early. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired reaction.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    i. Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii. Nitration -> Forms mainly **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    iii. Reduction -> **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv. Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline -> The protonated amine (-NH3+) and the t-Bu group both direct to the meta position relative to the amine, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    v-vii. Conversion of the amino group to a hydroxyl group gives **3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    This molecule has the wrong substitution pattern (a 1,3,4- pattern, not the required 1,2,3-pattern). So, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    i. Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii. Nitration -> **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    iii. Sulfonation -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. In this intermediate, the t-butyl and nitro groups are *para* to each other. It is impossible to rearrange them to the required *ortho* positions to form the target molecule. So, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is the most complex, but it correctly manipulates the directing effects using a blocking group. Let's trace it step-by-step to see if it produces **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n    *   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene.**\n        *   An ortho, para-director.\n\n    *   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n        *   Sulfonation occurs at the *para* position due to the large steric bulk of the t-butyl group. This effectively blocks the para position.\n\n    *   **iii) + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n        *   Now we nitrate. The t-butyl group (at C4) directs *ortho* (to C3, C5). The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H at C1) directs *meta* (to C3, C5). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C3). This is key: it establishes the necessary **ortho relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups**.\n\n    *   **iv) + Fe/HCl -> 3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n        *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. The ortho relationship is maintained (now between -NH2 and -tBu).\n\n    *   **v) + NaNO2/HCl -> Diazonium Salt.**\n        *   The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. The intermediate is `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid-3-diazonium chloride`.\n        *   Let's denote its structure as: -SO3H at C1, -N2+ at C3, -tBu at C4.\n\n    Now, we need to convert this intermediate into `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`. The subsequent steps appear unusual but lead to the desired product via a non-obvious (but plausible) nitration.\n\n    *   **vi) + HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration of the diazonium salt.**\n        *   This is the trickiest step. The ring is heavily deactivated by -SO3H and -N2+. However, all existing groups (-SO3H, -N2+, and -tBu) direct an incoming electrophile to the C5 position. Thus, nitration occurs here.\n        *   Product: `4-tert-butyl-5-nitro-3-sulfobenzenediazonium salt` (Structure: -SO3H at C1, -N2+ at C3, -tBu at C4, -NO2 at C5).\n\n    *   **vii) + H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 4-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n        *   The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. (The -N2+ at C3 becomes -OH).\n\n    *   **viii) + dilute H2SO4 -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.**\n        *   This is a desulfonation step, removing the -SO3H group from C1.\n        *   The remaining substituents are -OH at C3, -tBu at C4, and -NO2 at C5. Let's renumber this molecule according to IUPAC rules. The phenol -OH group gets priority as C1. This makes the -tBu group at C2 and the -NO2 group at C3.\n        *   The product is exactly **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n    *   **ix) + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.**\n        *   A standard Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into the desired ethoxy ether, our target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the reaction sequence in Option A, despite its complexity and a challenging intermediate nitration step, successfully creates the required 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern to form the precursor phenol and ultimately the target product in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>"
