    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary frame of reference, which we'll call **S**. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame of reference, which we'll call **S'**.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is **v**. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   The speed of light *within the glass* is the speed of light as measured in the glass's own frame of reference (S'). This is given by the index of refraction, `n`. By definition, `n = c / u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum and `u'` is the speed of light in the medium.\n    *   The problem specifies to use `c = 1`. Therefore, `n = 1 / u'`, which means the speed of the light beam in the S' frame is **u' = 1/n**. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this velocity **u**.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Velocity-Addition Formula:**\n    Since the velocities involved can be close to the speed of light, we must use the relativistic velocity-addition formula, not the classical Galilean one. The formula for adding two velocities `v` and `u'` that are in the same direction is:\n\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u') / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   `v` = `v`\n    *   `u'` = `1/n`\n    *   `c` = `1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + (v * (1/n)) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    `u = (n*v + n*(1/n)) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
