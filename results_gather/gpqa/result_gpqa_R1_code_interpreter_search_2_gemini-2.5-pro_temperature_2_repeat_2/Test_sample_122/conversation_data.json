    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the distance the supernova ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. The key information is the relative velocity and the time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics:** The velocity given (60,000 km/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). This means we must use the principles of Special Relativity, not classical Newtonian physics. The core concept here is **Time Dilation**.\n\n3.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The clock in this frame measures the *proper time* because it is at rest relative to the events happening within that frame (like the clock's own ticking).\n\n4.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity (v) = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (proper time, Δt₀) = 50 s.\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d) is the speed of the ejecta in that frame (v) multiplied by the time that has passed in that frame (Δt). The formula is `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   We know `v`, but we don't know `Δt` (the time in the Galaxy's frame).\n    *   We need to find `Δt` by using the time dilation formula, which relates the time in the \"stationary\" frame (Δt) to the proper time in the \"moving\" frame (Δt₀).\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n6.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:  `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`.\n        *   Next, square this ratio: `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`.\n        *   Now, calculate γ: `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        *   Using the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the distance (d).**\n        *   Using the distance formula: `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`.\n\n7.  **Use Python for a Precise Calculation:** To avoid manual rounding errors, I'll use a short Python script to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants and given values\nv = 60000  # speed of the ejecta in km/s\nt0 = 50      # proper time in the ejecta's frame in seconds\nc = 300000   # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v / c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the dilated time (time in the Galaxy's frame)\ndt = gamma * t0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\ndistance=3061862.178478442\n</execute_code>\n8.  **Analyze the Result:** The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect Newtonian answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option B, 3,060,000 km. The small difference is due to rounding in the problem's options. Therefore, B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem of Special Relativity. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy frame\" is the stationary frame of reference (S).\n    *   The \"ejecta frame\" is the moving frame of reference (S').\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v` = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), which is the proper time, `Δt₀` = 50 s.\n    *   We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy frame, `d`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:**\n    Since the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s), we must use the principles of Special Relativity. Specifically, we need to account for **time dilation**. An observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving frame (ejecta).

    "The calculation you provided is correct. Let's walk through the reasoning to confirm why the result leads to the chosen answer.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Problem Analysis:** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels from the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy. We are given the relative velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (`Δt₀`). Because the velocity (60,000 km/s) is a substantial fraction of the speed of light (300,000 km/s), we must use the principles of Special Relativity.\n\n2.  **Key Concept: Time Dilation:**\n    An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This effect is called time dilation. The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is longer than the time that passes in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`).\n\n3.  **Formulas:**\n    *   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is: `d = v * Δt`\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   The Lorentz factor, `γ`, is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n        *   `c = 300,000 km/s`\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n        *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy frame.**\n        *   `Δt₀ = 50 s`\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n        *(Note: While 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, over 51 seconds passed in the Galaxy.)*\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy frame.**\n        *   `d = v * Δt`\n        *   `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n5.  **Final Result:**\n    As the code output shows, `3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    This calculated value is very close to option B. The slight difference is due to the rounding of the value in the question's options.\n    *   Calculated distance: ~3,061,862 km\n    *   Option B: 3,060,000 km\n\nTherefore, B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
