    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation.** The alkene is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). This is a standard epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   For a *trans*-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene, *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom can happen from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   Attack from the top face yields one enantiomer of the epoxide, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the bottom face yields the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the product will be a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix of the two enantiomers). So, after the mCPBA step, we have a racemic mixture of *trans*-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide mixture is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This causes the epoxide ring to open, forming a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups).\n    *   This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, which proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism where the nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond (anti-attack).\n    *   The overall stereochemical outcome of *syn*-epoxidation followed by *anti*-ring opening is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n    *   The rule for stereospecific reactions states that **anti-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound**.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide, attack by H₂O at C4 inverts its stereocenter to 4S, giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide, attack by H₂O at C4 inverts it to 4R, giving (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A compound with (4R,5S) configuration and identical substituents at both ends (propyl groups in this case) has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound. Thus, both enantiomers of the epoxide lead to the same, single *meso* diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, the achiral **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation.** The alkene is treated with mCPBA.\n    *   *Syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry. Adding the oxygen from either the top or bottom face results in the same molecule: *cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane. This epoxide has a plane of symmetry, so it is a *meso* compound.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *meso*-epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, resulting in *anti*-attack by water.\n    *   The rule for stereospecific reactions states that **anti-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify: The meso-epoxide is (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-center) inverts it to S, yielding **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-center) inverts it to R, yielding **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture is formed. (4S,5S) and (4R,5R) are non-superimposable mirror images; they are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers**.\n*   (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will have different retention times, so they will be separated. The *meso*-diol will separate from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the *meso*-diol, and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The *meso*-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomers, will also have a different retention time and will be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **three peaks**: one for the *meso*-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
