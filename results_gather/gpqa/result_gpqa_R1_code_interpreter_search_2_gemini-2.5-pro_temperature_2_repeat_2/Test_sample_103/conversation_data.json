    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate the observed wavelength shift to the star's radial velocity.**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. The magnitude of this shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, along the line of sight:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The problem gives the *amplitude* of this periodic shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, which corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted by $K$.\n    Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars.**\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ milliangstroms\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ milliangstroms\n\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the relationship between the RV amplitude (K) and the orbital period (T).**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star also moves in a circular orbit around the system's barycenter. The star's orbital velocity, assuming we observe the system with an inclination $i$, gives an RV amplitude of:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi a_{star}}{T} \\sin(i)$\n    where $a_{star}$ is the radius of the star's orbit and $T$ is the orbital period.\n\n    From the definition of the center of mass, we have $M_{star} a_{star} = m_{planet} a_{planet}$, where $a_{planet}$ is the radius of the planet's orbit. Let $a = a_{star} + a_{planet}$ be the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit relative to the star. Then $a_{star} = a \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star} + m_{planet}}$. Substituting this into the equation for K:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T} \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star} + m_{planet}} \\sin(i)$\n\n    Now, we use Kepler's Third Law to relate the semi-major axis $a$ and the period $T$:\n    $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_{star} + m_{planet})} a^3 \\implies a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_{star} + m_{planet}) T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute this expression for $a$ back into the formula for $K$:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\left( \\frac{G(M_{star} + m_{planet}) T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star} + m_{planet}}$\n    Simplifying this expression gives:\n    $K = (2\\pi G)^{1/3} T^{-1/3} \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + m_{planet})^{2/3}}$\n\n    This shows that the RV amplitude $K$ is proportional to the period $T$ to the power of -1/3 ($K \\propto T^{-1/3}$), given that all other parameters are constant.\n\n4.  **Use the derived relationship to find the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    We can write the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two systems as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(2\\pi G)^{1/3} T_2^{-1/3} \\frac{m_{planet,2} \\sin(i_2)}{(M_{star,2} + m_{planet,2})^{2/3}}}{(2\\pi G)^{1/3} T_1^{-1/3} \\frac{m_{planet,1} \\sin(i_1)}{(M_{star,1} + m_{planet,1})^{2/3}}}$\n\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{planet,1} = m_{planet,2}$.\n    *   The term $m_{planet} \\sin(i)$ represents the *minimum mass*, which is what is directly constrained by RV observations. The statement \"both with masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that this observable quantity is the same for both planets ($m_{planet,1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{planet,2} \\sin(i_2)$). Alternatively, if we assume the true masses are equal, we must also assume the unknown inclinations are equal, leading to the same cancellation.\n\n    With these conditions, all terms cancel out except for the periods:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the final numerical answer.**\n    We substitute the known ratio of the RV amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the desired ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we first solve for $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$ by cubing both sides:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{343}{125} = 2.744$\n\n    Now, we invert the result to get the ratio of planet #2's period to planet #1's period:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nLet's use Python to get a precise decimal value.\n```python\n# The ratio of the RV amplitudes is K2/K1 = 7/5.\nK_ratio = 7 / 5\n\n# We derived that K2/K1 = (T1/T2)^(1/3).\n# Therefore, T1/T2 = (K2/K1)^3.\nT1_over_T2 = K_ratio**3\n\n# The question asks for T2/T1.\nT2_over_T1 = 1 / T1_over_T2\n\nprint(T2_over_T1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3644.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the link between Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method is based on the Doppler effect. The periodic shift in the wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a star's spectral lines is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The amplitude of this periodic shift, let's call it $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted by the letter $K$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars is the same as the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Derive the relationship between RV Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (T)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the host star's radial velocity ($K$) is given by:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_s + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula to the specific problem**\n    We are comparing two systems. Let's write the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p,2} \\sin(i_2)}{(M_{s,2} + m_{p,2})^{2/3}}}{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p,1} \\sin(i_1)}{(M_{s,1} + m_{p,1})^{2/3}}}$\n\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s,1} = M_{s,2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p,1} \\approx m_{p,2}$.\n    *   Since nothing is mentioned about the inclinations, we assume they are statistically similar or that the given \"masses\" refer to the measured minimum mass ($m_p \\sin(i)$), which is common in such problems. Thus, we assume $m_{p,1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx m_{p,2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    Under these assumptions, most terms cancel out, leaving a simple relationship between $K$ and $T$:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the ratio of the periods**\n    We can now substitute the known value of $K_2/K_1$:\n    $\\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    To find the ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{343}{125}$\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To get this, we invert the fraction:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    Now, let's calculate the decimal value.\n```python\n# The ratio of the periods T2/T1 can be calculated from the ratio of the RV amplitudes K2/K1.\n# The relationship is K2/K1 = (T1/T2)^(1/3).\n# The ratio of the wavelength shifts is equal to the ratio of the RV amplitudes.\nK2_over_K1 = 7 / 5\n\n# We need to solve for T2/T1.\n# T1/T2 = (K2_over_K1)^3\nT1_over_T2 = (K2_over_K1)**3\n\n# The desired ratio is the inverse of T1/T2.\nT2_over_T1 = 1 / T1_over_T2\n\nprint(T2_over_T1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the detailed step-by-step derivation and the result from the Python code execution, the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$) is approximately 0.3644.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value of 0.3644 is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
