    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence and an analysis of the provided statements.\n\n**Reaction Sequence Identification**\n\n1.  **A → B**: Compound A (C3H6) is an alkene, propene. It undergoes electrophilic addition with bromine (Br2) in an inert solvent, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).\n    *   `CH3-CH=CH2 (Propene, A) + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) (1,2-dibromopropane, B)`\n\n2.  **B → C**: Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) is a vicinal dihalide. It undergoes double dehydrohalogenation upon reaction with a strong base in an alcoholic medium (alcoholic KOH). This reaction forms an alkyne.\n    *   `CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) (B) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) --> CH3-C≡CH (Propyne, C) + 2 KBr + 2 H2O`\n\n3.  **C → D**: Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This condition causes the cyclic polymerization (trimerization) of the alkyne to form an aromatic compound.\n    *   `3 CH3-C≡CH (C) --(Red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene, D)`\n\n4.  **D → E**: Compound D (mesitylene) is an activated aromatic ring. It reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the nitrating mixture (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4), to undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration).\n    *   `Mesitylene (D) + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E)`\n\n5.  **E → F**: Compound E (a nitroaromatic compound) is reduced to a primary aromatic amine using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl), a standard method for nitro group reduction.\n    *   `2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E) --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesidine, F)`\n\n6.  **F → G**: Compound F (mesidine, a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, prepared in situ from NaNO2/HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) in a diazotization reaction to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   `Mesidine (F) + NaNO2/HCl (0-5 °C) --> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium salt (G)`\n\n7.  **G → H**: The diazonium salt (G) reacts with NaOH. Typically, warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt results in the substitution of the diazonium group by a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol. NaOH provides the alkaline medium for the reaction.\n    *   `1,3,5-trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium salt (G) --(H2O, warm, NaOH)--> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Mesitylol, H)`\n\n**Evaluation of the Statements**\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is Mesidine (2-amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), a primary aromatic amine. Aromatic amines are crucial precursors in the synthesis of azo dyes through diazonium coupling reactions. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **B) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. As a small alkyne, it is highly flammable. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene). The molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry (C3v point group).\n        *   All nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups will produce a single signal, a singlet (since there are no adjacent protons).\n        *   The three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent due to symmetry and have no adjacent protons, resulting in a second single signal, also a singlet.\n    *   Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of mesitylene shows two singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **C) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produce a distinct violet, purple, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored iron-phenoxide complex. While the exact color can vary, a yellow color is usually indicative of a negative test, as the ferric chloride solution itself is often yellow to brown. Specific tests for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol show that it gives no coloration or only the yellow color of the reagent, likely due to steric hindrance from the two ortho-methyl groups preventing complex formation. Therefore, the statement that it *gives* a yellow color as a positive result is misleading and chemically incorrect. A positive test implies the formation of a new, distinct color.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, B, and D are correct descriptions of the properties or uses of the respective compounds. Statement C is incorrect because 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (H) does not give a characteristic color reaction with ferric chloride; the \"yellow color\" is simply that of the reagent, indicating a negative result.\n\n<<<C>>>"
