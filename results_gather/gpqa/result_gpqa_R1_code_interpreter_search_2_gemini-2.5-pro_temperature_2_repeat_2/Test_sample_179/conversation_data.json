    "An isolated system of 13 identical particles is considered. Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`. The system consists of:\n1.  One charge fixed at a central point, P.\n2.  12 charges constrained to remain on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2` m, centered at P.\n\nThe total potential energy of this system of charges is the sum of the potential energies for all unique pairs of charges. We can divide these interactions into two categories:\n\n1.  **Interaction between the central charge and the 12 shell charges (`U_cs`):**\n    Each of the 12 charges on the shell is at a fixed distance `R` from the central charge. The potential energy of this interaction is the sum of the energies for these 12 pairs.\n    *   `q_central = q = 2e`\n    *   `q_shell = q = 2e`\n    *   Distance = `R = 2` m\n    The energy for one such pair is `k * q * q / R = k * q^2 / R`.\n    Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this category is:\n    `U_cs = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n2.  **Interaction among the 12 shell charges themselves (`U_ss`):**\n    These 12 identical charges are free to move on the surface of the sphere of radius R. To find the minimum energy of the system, these charges must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known problem called the **Thomson problem**.\n    For N=12 charges on the surface of a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n    The energy of this configuration is given by `U_ss = Σ (k * q^2 / r_ij)` for all `12*11/2 = 66` pairs of shell charges, where `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j`.\n    This can be written as `U_ss = (k * q^2 / R) * E_12`, where `E_12 = Σ (R / r_ij)` is the dimensionless energy coefficient for the icosahedral configuration (Thomson problem for N=12).\n\nThe value of `E_12` for an icosahedron is a known geometric constant. It can be calculated by summing the inverse distances over all pairs of vertices.

    "The problem asks for the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges. One charge is at a central point P, and the other 12 are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius R=2m, centered at P. Each particle has a charge of `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n\nThe total potential energy `U_total` of this system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can decompose this into two parts:\n1.  **`U_cs`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the shell.\n2.  **`U_ss`**: The potential energy from the mutual interaction among the 12 charges on the shell.\n\nThe total energy is `U_total = U_cs + U_ss`.\n\n**1. Central-Shell Interaction Energy (`U_cs`)**\n\nEach of the 12 charges on the shell is at a fixed distance `R = 2` m from the central charge `q`. The potential energy for a single pair is `k * q^2 / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant. Since there are 12 such identical charges interacting with the center, this part of the energy is:\n`U_cs = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\nThis energy component is constant regardless of the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere's surface.\n\n**2. Shell-Shell Interaction Energy (`U_ss`)**\n\nTo find the *minimum* total energy of the system, we need to find the configuration of the 12 shell charges that minimizes their mutual potential energy, `U_ss`. This is a classic problem in physics known as the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor `N=12` identical charges on the surface of a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The energy of this configuration is the sum of potential energies over all pairs of the shell charges. It can be written in a compact form:\n`U_ss = (k * q^2 / R) * E_12`\nwhere `E_12` is the dimensionless energy constant for the icosahedral configuration, defined as `E_12 = Σ (R / r_ij)` summed over all `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` pairs of charges on the shell. `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j`.\n\nThe value of `E_12` for an icosahedron is a known geometrical constant. It can be derived by summing up the inverse distances between all pairs of vertices. An icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R` has three distinct inter-vertex distances:\n*   30 pairs are separated by the edge length `s`.\n*   30 pairs are separated by a longer diagonal `d_2`.\n*   6 pairs are antipodal, separated by the diameter `2R`.\n\nA detailed geometric derivation shows that the dimensionless sum is:\n`E_12 = 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3`\n\n**3. Total Minimum Energy (`U_total`)**\n\nThe total minimum energy is the sum of the two components:\n`U_total = U_cs + U_ss`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + ((k * q^2 / R) * E_12)`\nFactoring out the common term `(k * q^2 / R)`:\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + E_12)`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `E_12`:\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3)`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (15 + 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)))`\n\nNow we can plug in the values for the constants:\n*   `k = 8.98755 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2`\n*   `e = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `q = 2e = 3.204353268 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `R = 2.0 m`\n\nThe calculation is performed using the provided Python script for accuracy. The script correctly implements the derived formula for the total energy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\nk = 8.98755e9  # Coulomb's constant in N m^2 / C^2\ne = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in C\nR = 2.0  # Radius in meters\n\n# Define the charge of each particle\nq = 2 * e\n\n# The problem is to find the minimum energy of the system.\n# This requires calculating the two components of the total potential energy:\n# 1.
