    "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. This process resulted in the formation of a mixture of gases. No solid residue was mentioned, which implies that the salts fully decomposed into gaseous products. This is characteristic of certain ammonium salts.\n\nThe gas mixture was passed through a series of tubes:\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H2O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO2. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change, meaning no CO2 or other acidic gases were present in the mixture. This indicates that the salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O2). The problem specifies that CuO was formed. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   This implies that the gas mixture contained an amount of an oxidizing agent that delivered 0.80 g of oxygen to the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n4.  **Remaining gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained (at STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C must be chemically inert to not have reacted in any of the tubes. Given that the reactants are likely nitrogen-containing ammonium salts (as they fully decompose into gases), the most probable inert gas is nitrogen (N2).\n\nFrom the products (H2O, N2, and an oxygen source), we deduce that the original salts A and B are composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Common salts fitting this description are ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of ammonium nitrite (A) and ammonium nitrate (B).\nThe decomposition reactions at 200°C are:\n*   A: NH4NO2(s) → N2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n*   B: NH4NO3(s) → N2O(g) + 2H2O(g)\nNote that at this temperature, ammonium nitrate produces nitrous oxide (N2O), not O2. Nitrous oxide is also an oxidizing gas that would react with hot copper:\n*   Reaction in Tube №3: N2O(g) + Cu(s) → N2(g) + CuO(s)\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and salt B in the equimolar mixture.\n\nBased on the decomposition reactions:\n*   Moles of N2 produced directly = n (from NH4NO2)\n*   Moles of N2O produced = n (from NH4NO3)\n*   Moles of H2O produced = 2n (from NH4NO2) + 2n (from NH4NO3) = 4n\n\nLet's use the experimental data to find 'n'.\n*   From the water collected in Tube №1, we have 0.20 mol of H2O.\n*   So, 4n = 0.20 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n\nThis means the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH4NO2 and 0.05 mol of NH4NO3. Let's verify this against the other data points.\n\n*   **Total Initial Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH4NO2 = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH4NO3 = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the given initial mass.\n\n*   **Mass Increase in Tube №3:**\n    *   The gas entering Tube №3 is n = 0.05 mol of N2O.\n    *   In the reaction `N2O + Cu → N2 + CuO`, 0.05 mol of N2O will deliver 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   This matches the mass increase of Tube №3.\n\n*   **Final Gas C Volume:**\n    *   The final gas is N2. It comes from two sources:\n        1.  Directly from the decomposition of NH4NO2: n = 0.05 mol.\n        2.  From the reaction of N2O in Tube №3: n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N2 = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Volume at STP = 0.10 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 2.24 L.\n    *   This matches the volume of the final gas C.\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The salts are ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3).\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO2):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\n\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO3):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each:\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning confirms the salts are NH4NO2 and NH4NO3.\n# We need to find the total number of atoms in their formulas.\n\n# Atoms in NH4NO2:\nN_atoms_A = 2\nH_atoms_A = 4\nO_atoms_A = 2\ntotal_atoms_A = N_atoms_A + H_atoms_A + O_atoms_A\n\n# Atoms in NH4NO3:\nN_atoms_B = 2\nH_atoms_B = 4\nO_atoms_B = 3\ntotal_atoms_B = N_atoms_B + H_atoms_B + O_atoms_B\n\n# Total atoms in both salts A and B:\ntotal_atoms_combined = total_atoms_A + total_atoms_B\n\nprint(total_atoms_combined)\n```",
    "The calculations are consistent and verified by the experimental data provided. The salts have been identified as ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3).\n\n-   Salt A, NH4NO2, has 2 N atoms, 4 H atoms, and 2 O atoms, for a total of 8 atoms.\n-   Salt B, NH4NO3, has 2 N atoms, 4 H atoms, and 3 O atoms, for a total of 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of atoms in both salts is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 15\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is C.\n<<<C>>>"
