    "This is a classic piece of chemistry lab jargon. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **The Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A primary activity in this type of lab is performing chemical reactions to create new compounds and then purifying those compounds from the reaction mixture (which might contain starting materials, byproducts, and the desired product).\n2.  **The Problem:** The chemist says their compounds are \"on top of each other.\" This is a colloquialism for a failed separation. In a separation technique, you want to get your different compounds into different places (e.g., different collection flasks, different spots on a plate, etc.). If they are \"on top of each other,\" it means they are still mixed together.\n3.  **Evaluating the Separation Techniques:** The most common purification technique in synthetic organic chemistry is **chromatography**, particularly thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for quick analysis and column chromatography for large-scale purification.\n    *   **How Chromatography Works:** Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (often polar, like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent, or \"eluent\"). Compounds with different **polarities** will interact differently with the stationary phase and move at different speeds, allowing for their separation.\n    *   **\"On Top of Each Other\" in Chromatography:** On a TLC plate, a mixture is spotted at the bottom, and the solvent moves up the plate. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at nearly the same rate. When the plate is visualized, the spots corresponding to these two compounds will appear at the same heightâ€”they will be, quite literally, \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that separating them by column chromatography will be extremely difficult because they will elute (come out of the column) at the same time.\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Similar optical rotations are a property of the purified compounds, not a reason for a failed separation.\n    *   B) Similar boiling points would be a problem for **distillation**, another separation technique. While plausible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more commonly used to describe the result on a TLC plate than overlapping fractions in a distillation.\n    *   C) Non-covalent interactions are the *fundamental physical reason* for properties like polarity and boiling point, but the chemist is describing the observable experimental outcome, not the underlying physics.\n    *   D) The fact that the spots on a chromatogram are \"on top of each other\" is a direct experimental observation that means the compounds have **similar polarities**. This is the most common and direct interpretation of the phrase in a synthetic chemistry lab.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely complaining that the compounds they are trying to separate have nearly identical polarities, making purification by chromatography (their likely method of choice) impossible under the current conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
