    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, where:\n*   M₁ = Initial concentration = 0.05 M\n*   V₁ = Initial volume = 20.00 cm³\n*   V₂ = Final volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   M₂ = Final concentration (what we need to find)\n\nM₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nWhere:\n*   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n*   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   pKa = -log(Ka)\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    At 25% titration, the ratio of base formed to acid remaining is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    We can now plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nLet's use Python to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Ka for acetic acid\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base] to [acid] is 25/75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\n\n# Calculate pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\nprint(f'The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}')\n```\n\n executing code:\n ```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Ka for acetic acid\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base] to [acid] is 25/75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\n\n# Calculate pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\nprint(f'The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}')\n```\n>>>\nThe pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\n>>>\nThe first value is **4.26**.\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic:\n\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nTo find the pH, we must first find the concentration of OH⁻ produced.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH.\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence:**\n    At equivalence, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at equivalence:**\n    Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n\n    For the hydrolysis, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02)\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nLet's use Python for this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants and previously calculated values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nconc_acetate_at_eq = 0.02 # in M\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration\n# x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_at_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH_at_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f'The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_eq:.2f}')\n```\n\n executing code:\n ```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants and previously calculated values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nconc_acetate_at_eq = 0.02 # in M\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration\n# x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_at_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH_at_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f'The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_eq:.2f}')\n```\n>>>\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n>>>\nThe second value is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The pH at 25% titration is calculated to be 4.26. Now, let's proceed to calculate the pH at the equivalence point.\n\n### **pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Moles of Acetic Acid:**\n    *   Initial Molarity of diluted acetic acid = 0.025 M\n    *   Volume = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Volume of NaOH Added:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of NaOH = 0.1 M\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Total Volume and Acetate Concentration:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic:\n        CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n        Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw (ion product of water) = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n        Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   The equilibrium expression is Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n\n5.  **Calculate [OH⁻], pOH, and pH:**\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    *   Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). We assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻])\n\nLet's perform the calculation with Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and calculated values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nconc_acetate_at_eq = 0.02 # Concentration of acetate at equivalence point in M\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-]\n# Let x = [OH-], then Kb = x^2 / (conc_acetate_at_eq - x)\n# Assuming x is small, x = sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_at_eq)\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_at_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH_at_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\n>>>\nCode output: The pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n\nErrors:",
