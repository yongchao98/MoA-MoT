    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (y * M_H) / (x * M_C + y * M_H), where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using integer masses (H=1, C=12), the fraction is y / (12x + y).\n    *   Setting this to 14.28% (or 0.1428): y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428.\n    *   A simple fraction that is very close to 0.1428 is 1/7 (≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's check if the formula can be of the form (CH2)n, which is CnH2n.\n    *   For CnH2n, the mass fraction of H is (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the data.\n    *   Z is stated to be unreactive towards further hydrogenation, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. Z is also described as a widely used solvent, and cycloalkanes like cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane are common solvents.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and Substance D.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated (or aromatic).\n    *   Z is one of the constituents of Y. So Y = {Z, D}, where D is the other liquid.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Since Z is already saturated, hydrogenating Z gives Z. Therefore, hydrogenating D must also give Z.\n    *   Since D is a component of Y, it does not decolorize bromine water. A substance that does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated (under \"severe conditions\") to a cycloalkane is characteristic of an aromatic compound.\n    *   So, D is an aromatic hydrocarbon which, upon hydrogenation, yields Z. This means D has the same carbon skeleton as Z. A common aromatic ring is a benzene ring. An aromatic hydrocarbon with n carbons and a single benzene ring would have a formula of CnH(2n-6).\n    *   So, Y is an equimolar mixture of Z (CnH2n, a cycloalkane) and D (CnH(2n-6), an aromatic hydrocarbon).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z, so A and B must both have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y. Since the mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry of the reaction is likely 1:1:1:1.\n    *   A + B → Z + D\n    *   This is a disproportionation reaction, specifically an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) while the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   A + B → CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)\n    *   Let the degree of unsaturation of A and B relative to the cycloalkane Z be 'a' and 'b', respectively. This means A and B have 'a' and 'b' units of unsaturation (a C=C bond or a ring count as one unit; we are comparing to the cycloalkane Z which already has one ring). So the formulas are:\n        *   A = CnH(2n-2a)\n        *   B = CnH(2n-2b)\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n        (Number of H in A) + (Number of H in B) = (Number of H in Z) + (Number of H in D)\n        (2n - 2a) + (2n - 2b) = (2n) + (2n - 6)\n        4n - 2(a + b) = 4n - 6\n        -2(a + b) = -6\n        a + b = 3\n    *   Since A and B decolorize bromine water, they must be unsaturated, meaning a > 0 and b > 0. Since A and B are two different liquids, a ≠ b. The only pair of distinct positive integers that sum to 3 is {1, 2}.\n    *   Therefore, one component of X is a cycloalkene (degree of unsaturation a=1, formula CnH(2n-2)), and the other is a cycloalkadiene (degree of unsaturation b=2, formula CnH(2n-4)).\n    *   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds, so the cycloalkadiene must have its double bonds separated by at least one sp3 carbon.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Total H = (H atoms in CnH(2n-2)) + (H atoms in CnH(2n-4))\n    *   Total H = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n'.**\n    *   We need to find 'n'. The options provided correspond to different values of 'n'.\n    *   Option A: 12 → 4n-6 = 12 → 4n = 18 → n = 4.5 (not an integer)\n    *   Option B: 16 → 4n-6 = 16 → 4n = 22 → n = 5.5 (not an integer)\n    *   Option C: 22 → 4n-6 = 22 → 4n = 28 → n = 7\n    *   Option D: 18 → 4n-6 = 18 → 4n = 24 → n = 6\n    *   The possibilities are n=6 or n=7. Let's check their chemical feasibility.\n    *   **Case n=6:**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent.\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   A = Cycloalkene C6H(12-2) = C6H10 (Cyclohexene).\n        *   B = Cycloalkadiene C6H(12-4) = C6H8 (e.g., 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, which is non-conjugated).\n        *   This case is perfectly consistent with all the information. The reaction is C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   **Case n=7:**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), a solvent.\n        *   D = Toluene (C7H8).\n        *   A = C7H(14-2) = C7H12 (Methylcyclohexene).\n        *   B = C7H(14-4) = C7H10 (e.g., non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene, which exists).\n        *   This case is also chemically consistent.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both n=6 and n=7 lead to plausible scenarios that fit the description. However, the disproportionation of C6-cyclic compounds is the most classic and fundamental example of this type of reaction. In the context of a typical chemistry problem, when multiple scenarios are possible, the simplest and most common example is usually the intended one. The C6 system is the archetypal example. Therefore, n=6 is the most probable intended answer.\n\n6.  **Final Answer.**\n    *   Based on n=6, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\nFinal check:\n*   X = Equimolar {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}. They are liquids, unsaturated, and the diene is non-conjugated.\n*   Y = Equimolar {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. They are liquids and do not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Reaction: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a disproportionation producing an equimolar mixture.\n*   Hydrogenation: Hydrogenating both mixtures gives only Cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Z = Cyclohexane. C6H12 has H% = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. It's a widely used solvent, a component of Y, and is saturated.\n*   All conditions are met for n=6. The total number of H atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
