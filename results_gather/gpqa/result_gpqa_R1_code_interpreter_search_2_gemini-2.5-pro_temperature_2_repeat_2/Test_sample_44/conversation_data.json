    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the three lowest states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Key Principle:** Fermions obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a 1-D infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Quantum States:** The state of a single particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    *   The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    *   The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be spin up (+1/2) or spin down (-1/2).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a given level `n` is:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the energy of a particle in level `n` is simply:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, since there are two possible spin states (up and down) for each energy level `n`, each level can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n**3. Total Energy of the System**\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. To find the energies of the ground state and excited states, we must find the particle configurations with the lowest possible total energies.\n\n**Configuration 1: Ground State**\n\nTo achieve the ground state (lowest total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** We place the first two particles in the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed: $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed: $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of these energies:\n$E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**Configuration 2: First Excited State**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we must create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the next available level, n=3.\n*   **New configuration:**\n    *   Two particles in n=1. Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n    *   One particle in n=2. Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E$.\n    *   One particle in n=3. Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**Configuration 3: Second Excited State**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We can find this by considering all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and identifying the second-lowest energy jump.\n\nLet's list the energies of the lowest-lying configurations:\n*   **Ground State:** {2 in n=1, 2 in n=2}. Energy = $2(1^2)E + 2(2^2)E = 10E$.\n*   **First Excitation:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}. Energy = $2(1^2)E + 1(2^2)E + 1(3^2)E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n*   **Next possible excitation:** Consider promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (from the ground state). This is a higher energy jump than from n=2 to n=3, but let's check the total energy.\n    *   **Configuration:** {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n    *   Energy = $1(1^2)E + 2(2^2)E + 1(3^2)E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Another possible excitation:** Consider promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   **Configuration:** {2 in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n    *   Energy = $2(1^2)E + 2(3^2)E = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the second-lowest is 18E.\n\nThe total energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
