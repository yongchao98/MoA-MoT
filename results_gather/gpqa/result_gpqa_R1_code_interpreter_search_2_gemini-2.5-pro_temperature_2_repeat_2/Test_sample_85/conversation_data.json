    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product**\n\n*   Both reactions yield a substituted lactone named **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   Let's break down the structure from the name:\n    *   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n    *   **tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n    *   **2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. The oxygen atom is position 1.\n    *   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is at position 4.\n*   This structure is a **delta-lactone**, which is a cyclic ester in a six-membered ring.\n*   The reactions produce specific stereoisomers: (R) in reaction 1 and (S) in reaction 2. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group.\n\n**2. Determine the Lactone Precursor**\n\n*   Lactones are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxycarboxylic acids. A six-membered delta-lactone is formed from a **5-hydroxycarboxylic acid**.\n*   Let's identify the specific hydroxy acid that would cyclize to our product. By \"opening\" the ester bond of the lactone, we get:\n    `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`\n*   This precursor is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n*   The chiral center in this precursor is C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). This C3 becomes C4 in the lactone. The relative arrangement of the groups does not change, so the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) is conserved during cyclization.\n    *   (R)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will cyclize to (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n    *   (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid will cyclize to (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**3. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Let's decode this IUPAC name to determine its structure:\n    *   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) as the principal functional group. This makes the carboxyl carbon C1.\n    *   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group is at C3.\n    *   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: At C5, there is a carbonyl group (`=O`, oxo) and an isobutoxy group (`-O-isobutyl`). Together, this describes an isobutyl ester group: `-C(=O)O-isobutyl`.\n*   Putting it together, the structure is:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl`\n*   This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, with a free carboxylic acid at one end and an isobutyl ester at the other. The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**4. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe problem hinges on the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids are reduced much more slowly.\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: This reagent shows the opposite selectivity. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction**: Starting with compound A (the named structure), LiBH4 will reduce the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 untouched.\n    `A + LiBH4 → HOOC-CH2-CH(Et*)-CH2-CH2OH`\n    (where Et* indicates the chiral center)\n2.  **Cyclization**: The resulting molecule is the required precursor, 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid. The H+ workup catalyzes its cyclization to the 6-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reduction occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center (C3). The reaction does not affect the stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A is retained in the final product.\n4.  **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH3 → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction**: Starting with compound B (the same structure as A, but possibly a different stereoisomer), BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), leaving the ester at C5 untouched.\n    `B + BH3 → HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et*)-CH2-C(=O)O-isobutyl`\n2.  **Cyclization**: The resulting molecule is a hydroxy-ester. Under acidic workup (H+), the terminal alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl in an intramolecular transesterification reaction, forming the 6-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry**: The reduction occurs at C1, away from the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion**: To obtain the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
