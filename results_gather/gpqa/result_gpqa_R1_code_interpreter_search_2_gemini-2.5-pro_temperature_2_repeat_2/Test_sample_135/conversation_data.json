    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `f(r)`, within a sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   Integral to evaluate: `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n    *   Vector field: The field has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and points radially outwards. In vector form, using spherical coordinates, this is `f = (1/r^2) r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   Volume `V`: A sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool: The Divergence Theorem**\n    The problem involves an integral of a divergence over a volume. The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) is the perfect tool for this. It relates the volume integral of the divergence to a surface integral of the field itself over the boundary of the volume.\n    *   **Divergence Theorem:** `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    *   Here, `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n3.  **Address the Singularity:**\n    The vector field `f = (1/r^2) r̂` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite. The origin is inside our volume `V`.\n    *   If we were to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` for `r > 0`, we would find it to be zero. A naive integration of zero over the volume would incorrectly yield a result of 0.\n    *   The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this issue by relating the volume integral (which includes the effect of the singularity) to the surface integral over the boundary, where the field is well-defined (`r=R`). The flux calculated on the surface `S` correctly accounts for the \"source\" at the origin.\n\n4.  **Set up the Surface Integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`**\n    *   **Field on the surface (S):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) r̂`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Element (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` also points radially outwards. Its vector form is `dS = dS * r̂`. In spherical coordinates, the magnitude of the area element is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    *   Therefore, the vector surface element is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) r̂`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**\n    We need to compute the dot product of the field vector and the surface element vector.\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) r̂]`\n    *   The `R^2` terms cancel each other out.\n    *   The dot product of the radial unit vector with itself is `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r̂ ⋅ r̂) = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   Notice that the result is independent of the radius `R`.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integral**\n    Now, we integrate the result from the previous step over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n    from scipy import integrate\n    \n    # We want to compute the double integral of sin(theta) over the surface of a sphere.\n    # The integral is ∫[from 0 to 2pi] d(phi) ∫[from 0 to pi] sin(theta) d(theta).\n    \n    # Define the function to integrate, which is just sin(theta).\n    # The order of arguments for dblquad is f(theta, phi)\n    def integrand(theta, phi):\n        return np.sin(theta)\n    \n    # Perform the double integration.\n    # The limits are: phi from 0 to 2pi, and theta from 0 to pi.\n    result, error = integrate.dblquad(integrand, 0, 2 * np.pi, lambda phi: 0, lambda phi: np.pi)\n    \n    print(result)\n    ```\n    \n    **Reasoning through the manual calculation:**\n    `∮_S f ⋅ dS = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} [ ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ ] dφ`\n    *   **Inner integral (with respect to θ):**\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   **Outer integral (with respect to φ):**\n        `∫_0^{2π} 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^{2π} = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The value of the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)` is `4π`.\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
