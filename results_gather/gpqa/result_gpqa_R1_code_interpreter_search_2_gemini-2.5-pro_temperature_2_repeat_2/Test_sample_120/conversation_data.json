    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes the core structure. It is a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The numbering `[4.1.0]` indicates that the bridgehead carbons are connected by chains of 4, 1, and 0 atoms. The 1-atom bridge is the epoxide oxygen (O-7), and the 0-atom bridge is the direct bond between the bridgehead carbons, C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups are attached to carbons 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` specifies the absolute configuration at the chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me2CuLi`, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The problem statement provides a key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles, and their reactions with epoxides are classic examples of SN2-type reactions, which are highly sensitive to steric hindrance.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by atoms C1, C6, and O7. The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6.\n*   Let's examine the substitution pattern at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** is a quaternary carbon (part of the cyclohexane ring and also bonded to a methyl group).\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon (part of the cyclohexane ring and bonded to a hydrogen).\n*   Clearly, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from `Me2CuLi` will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity (Inversion of Configuration)**\n\n*   The problem statement also gives the rule for stereochemistry: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This is a characteristic feature of an SN2 reaction. The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the leaving group (the C-O epoxide bond). This is a backside attack, which results in an inversion of the stereocenter.\n*   The attack occurs at C6, which has a starting configuration of `(6S)` as given in the name.\n*   After the reaction, the stereocenter at C6 will have the opposite configuration, which is `(R)`.\n*   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the reaction. Therefore, their configurations will be retained.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\n*   The reaction breaks the C6-O bond, and a new C-C bond is formed between C6 and the new methyl group. The epoxide oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an implicit aqueous workup, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl substituents. We need to number the ring according to IUPAC rules to name it correctly.\n*   **Numbering:**\n    1.  The carbon bearing the principal functional group, the hydroxyl group (-OH), gets the lowest possible number. The -OH is on the original C1, so this carbon becomes the new **C1**.\n    2.  We then number the ring in the direction that gives the lowest possible set of locants for the substituents (the methyl groups).\n    *   The methyl groups are on the original C1, C3, C4, and the new one is on C6.\n    *   **Path A (counter-clockwise):** C1(old) -> C6(old) -> C5(old) -> C4(old) -> C3(old) -> C2(old).\n        *   New C1 = old C1 (has a Me)\n        *   New C2 = old C6 (has a new Me)\n        *   New C3 = old C5\n        *   New C4 = old C4 (has a Me)\n        *   New C5 = old C3 (has a Me)\n        *   Substituent locants: **1, 2, 4, 5**.\n    *   **Path B (clockwise):** C1(old) -> C2(old) -> C3(old) -> C4(old) -> C5(old) -> C6(old).\n        *   Substituent locants would be 1, 3, 4, 6.\n*   Comparing the locant sets (1,2,4,5) and (1,3,4,6), the first set is lower. Thus, Path A gives the correct numbering. The product name stem is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This conclusion eliminates options B and D, which propose a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern, implying the attack happened at C1.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Product Name with Stereochemistry**\n\n*   We now map the initial configurations to the final, correctly numbered structure.\n*   **New C1 (from old C1):** Configuration is retained. `(1R)` remains `(1R)`.\n*   **New C2 (from old C6):** Configuration is inverted. `(6S)` becomes `(R)`. So, `(2R)`.\n*   **New C4 (from old C4):** Configuration is retained. `(4R)` remains `(4R)`.\n*   **New C5 (from old C3):** Configuration is retained. `(3R)` becomes `(R)`. So, `(5R)`.\n\n*   Combining these, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
