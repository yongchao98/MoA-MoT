    "*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Energy-Time):** The core principle connecting the lifetime of a quantum state and its energy is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that the uncertainty in the energy of a state (ΔE) multiplied by the lifetime of the state (Δt) is greater than or equal to a fundamental constant. The relation is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Clearly Distinguish/Resolve\":** When we measure the energy of a state with a finite lifetime, we don't get a single sharp value. Instead, we get a distribution of energies with a certain width, ΔE. This is known as natural broadening or lifetime broadening. To distinguish between two different energy levels, E1 and E2, the energy difference between them, |E2 - E1|, must be at least comparable to, and preferably larger than, the energy widths of the levels. The state with the shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty (width). This larger width is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\n*   **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n    1.  We need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state using the approximate relation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. It's best to use the value of ħ in units of eV·s since the options are in electron-volts (eV).\n\n    2.  **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    3.  **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    4.  **Resolution Condition:** The energy level for State 1 is \"broader\" or more uncertain (ΔE1 > ΔE2) because its lifetime is shorter. To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy separation must be significantly greater than the larger of the two uncertainties.\n        *   Required energy difference: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1\n        *   |E2 - E1| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We now check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n        *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n    Only option B provides an energy separation large enough to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the energy broadening of the states.\n\n<<<B>>>"
