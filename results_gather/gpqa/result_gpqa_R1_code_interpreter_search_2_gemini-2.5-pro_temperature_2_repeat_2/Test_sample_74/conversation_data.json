You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and the problem.**\n    *   The goal is to overexpress a recombinant GADD45G protein in CHO cells.\n    *   The protein is designed to have an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag for purification.\n    *   The problem is a failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n    *   The key piece of information is the DNA sequence of the construct.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the sequence of the HA tag.**\n    *   The problem states the tag is a \"single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant\". The standard peptide sequence for this tag is YPYDVPDYA.\n\n*   **Step 3: Translate the provided DNA sequence to verify the components.**\n    *   The provided DNA sequence is:\n        5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC AAATGACTCTGGAA... TGA 3'\n    *   Translation begins at the first `ATG`, which is the start codon. The reading frame is determined from this point.\n    *   Let's translate the initial part of the sequence codon by codon:\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M) - The start codon.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    *   The translated sequence so far is `M-YPYDVPDYA`. The Methionine is the initiator, and `YPYDVPDYA` is the correct sequence for the HA tag. So, the tag sequence itself is correct.\n\n*   **Step 4: Continue translating the sequence immediately following the HA tag.**\n    *   The DNA sequence continues right after `GCC` (Alanine). Let's examine the very next codons which should correspond to the start of the GADD45G protein.\n    *   Next codon: `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   Next codon: `TGA`\n    *   `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons in the genetic code (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`).\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the effect of the premature stop codon.**\n    *   The presence of the `TGA` stop codon just two codons after the HA tag will cause the ribosome to terminate translation.\n    *   The resulting polypeptide will be extremely short (`M-YPYDVPDYA-K`), consisting only of the HA tag and one amino acid from the target protein. This truncated and non-functional peptide would likely not be detected in an experiment looking for the full-length GADD45G protein.\n\n*   **Step 6: Evaluate the given options based on this finding.**\n    *   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers are good practice, their absence doesn't typically cause failed expression. The primary issue here is that the full protein is not even being synthesized.\n    *   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As shown in Step 3, the HA tag sequence is translated correctly. There is no mutation within the tag sequence itself.\n    *   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what the analysis shows. The `TGA` codon acts as a premature stop signal, halting protein synthesis long before the full GADD45G sequence can be translated. This is the direct cause of the failed experiment.\n    *   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is incorrect on two levels. First, the stop codon found is `TGA` (which is `UGA` on the mRNA), not `UAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation. Therefore, this option is biologically inaccurate.\n\nThe analysis clearly points to a premature stop codon causing early termination of translation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
