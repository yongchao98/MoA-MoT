    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogens replaced by substituents, giving a core of **C6H4**. The 4 protons on the ring are aromatic protons.\n*   **FTIR:** The spectrum indicates an **ester group (-COO-)**. An ester contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond.\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This indicates six sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that these 4 protons give only two signals strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, specifically **para (1,4) substitution**. In a 1,4-disubstituted ring with two different substituents, the four aromatic protons form an AA'BB' system, which typically appears as two distinct signals (often two doublets).\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond.\n        *   Signal 1: **Doublet**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   Signal 2: **Doublet of quartets**. This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl (-CH3) group (three protons, giving the quartet by the n+1 rule).\n        *   These two signals are characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group gives the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton gives the doublet. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two –CH3 signals:** There are two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl group we just identified (`-CH=CH-**CH3**`).\n        *   The second methyl group must be the final piece of the puzzle. Since we have an ester group and no other information suggesting where a methyl group could be, it is most likely part of the ester, forming either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`).\n    *   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial constraint. The molecule contains no methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following building blocks:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n2.  A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (formula **C3H5**)\n3.  An ester substituent that also contains the second methyl group. The simplest options that don't have a -CH2- group are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3** (formula **C2H3O2**)\n    *   An acetate group: **-OCOCH3** (formula **C2H3O2**)\n\nLet's combine these fragments to find the total molecular formula. Regardless of which ester isomer it is, the parts are the same:\n\n*   Carbon atoms: 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 carbons**\n*   Hydrogen atoms: 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   Oxygen atoms: **2 oxygens**\n\nThus, the molecular formula is **C11H12O2**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation and Rule Out Other Options**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **Our proposed structure (C11H12O2):**\n    *   Contains a benzene ring (DoU = 4), a C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and a C=O double bond (DoU = 1).\n    *   Total required DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the formula C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. The DoU matches perfectly.\n\n*   **Checking the other options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 6. Consistent with the data.\n    *   **B) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. This DoU is also plausible. However, to construct a C12H14O2 molecule with the given NMR features, one would have to add a `CH2` unit somewhere (e.g., an ethyl ester like `-COOCH2CH3`). This would introduce a `-CH2-` signal, which is explicitly forbidden by the problem statement. Therefore, C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This DoU is too high, suggesting an extra ring or pi bond for which there is no evidence.\n    *   **D) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This DoU is too low, meaning a required feature (like the aromatic ring or one of the double bonds) would be missing, contradicting the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll spectroscopic evidence points towards a structure whose molecular formula is C11H12O2. The pieces fit together perfectly without violating any of the given constraints.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
